India and Pakistan are “on the brink of a flashpoint” and “at any moment” a nuclear war could break out, warned leader of the Pakistan Muslim league Ijaz Ul Haq. Pakistani officials have said the airstrikes were carried out a day after Indian warplanes struck inside Pakistan for the first time since a war in 1971. Tensions have been growing since a suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police on February 14.

We have the right to safeguard our sovereignty – Pakistan will go to any extent to do that

But the conflict worsened on Tuesday when India launched an air strike on what it said was a militant training base.

The Pakistan Muslim league leader said he agrees that tensions are escalating between both nuclear nations.

Mr Ul Haq said: “I think we are more concerned than the rest of the world. We are sitting right on the brink of a flashpoint.

“Particularly Kashmir is an issue which can create at any moment something can happen.

“I don’t think there is going to be a conventional war this time around.

“And I think somebody is going to be stupid enough to press the button and then everyone is going to face it.”
