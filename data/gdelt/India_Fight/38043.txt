Left parties condemn revocation of Article 370

The district units of the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), on Tuesday strongly condemned the Centre’s move to revoke Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, terming it was a “murder of democracy”.

The members staged a protest outside the Deputy Commissioners’ office and raised the slogans against Union government for passing the J&K Reorganisation Bill.

CPI(M) leader Maruti Manpade accused the BJP of scraping Article 370 and 35(A) of the Constitution and for bifurcating Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.

The Centre has intensified tension in Jammu and Kashmir by deploying thousands of paramilitary forces and police personnel and blocked main roads in several parts. Mr. Manpade also criticised the Modi-led government at the Centre for the house arrest of senior political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir.

The BJP had violated the norms to convert a State into a Union Territory overnight without the consent of the stakeholders. The Centre was defying all democratic norms to achieve its objects, he added.

Mr. Manpade said the removal of special status to Jammu and Kashmir is an attack on the Indian Constitution.
