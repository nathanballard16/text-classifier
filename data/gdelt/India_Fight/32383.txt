Residents block Chennai-Tiruvallur High Road, demand immediate action

A 60-year-old man, who was arrested on charges of raping and murdering a four-year-old girl in Thirumullaivoyal, was remanded in judicial custody on Friday.

The offender, Meenatchi Sundaram, 60, was a neighbour and relative of the victim. He was an ex-serviceman. On Thursday evening, the victim’s mother brought her and her brother back from school.

The mother took her son to a tuition centre nearby, leaving the girl alone in the house. However, her daughter was missing when she returned 10 minutes later. After searching for the girl, she complained to the Thirumullaivoyal police station. The police found the child’s body inside a gunny bag in the bathroom.

They first interrogated a neighbour who lived on the first floor. Following this, they searched Meenatchi Sundaram’s house as he was behaving suspiciously. They found pieces of broken bangles and an ear stud on his bed. Later, he confessed to sexually assaulting the girl and choking her to death as she cried. He was booked under Sections 376 AB (Punishment for rape on woman under 12 years of age), 302 (Punishment for murder) of IPC read with Section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

Local women blocked the Chennai-Tiruvallur High Road and marched towards the Thirumullaivoyal police station.

They demanded immediate punishment for the accused and wanted the police to hand him over to them. The crowd was later dispersed.
