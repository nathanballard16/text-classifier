Woman held for ‘killing’ sister-in-law in Khurda

BHUBANESWAR: A 30-year-old woman was arrested on Sunday for allegedly killing her sister-in-law on Saturday under the Balugaon police station limits in Khurda district.The accused has been identified by police as Kaberi Behera. Police said Kaberi allegedly killed 17-year-old Shibani by slitting her throat in their house over a family feud. Shibani was a Plus II student. Police initially felt that Shibani was killed by her spurned lover. “We received a complaint from the deceased’s mother, Babita , saying that a local youth was harassing Shibani for a long time. Hence, we suspected that the murder was the result of a fallout between the two. Kaberi too said she saw the local youth killing Shibani,” Khurda SP Ajay Pratap Swain said. Based on the complaint, police detained a few suspects, including the youth, for interrogation.Swain added, “We subsequently found out that Kaberi was the real culprit. She wanted to mislead police by shifting the focus on the local youth and deliberately put the blame on him. Based on the circumstantial evidence, we found that Kaberi eliminated Shibani,”Swain said Kaberi had a strained relationship with Shibani even though they were staying under one roof. On Friday night, an argument broke out between the two, following which Kaberi killed Shibani the next evening when the family members were away.“I never expected that one of our own could kill my daughter. She (Kaberi) should be hanged,” Babita said.
