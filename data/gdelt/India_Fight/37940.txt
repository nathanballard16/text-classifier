Meanwhile, Kareena is making a weekly visit to Mumbai to shoot for Dance India Dance 7, on which she is one of the judges. Talking about it, a source had earlier said to DNA After Hrs, "Kareena has always balanced her professional and personal life well. She has a choc-a-block schedule ahead with four big movies coming up. Her film, Good News, with Akshay Kumar, will release at the end of this year for which the promotions will begin a month before. She is flying down from London only for a day so that she can spend more time with Taimur. Besides, she endorses 17 brands, so there will be quite a few campaigns that she will be shooting for."
