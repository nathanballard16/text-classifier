Noida: Google reviews led cops to e-cigarettes supplier

NOIDA: Administrative officials who had raided a Sector 65 warehouse selling e-cigarettes on July 8 have said there are at least four more suppliers of the banned device that they are trying to track.These groups, they said, have been lying low and refusing to supply vaping devices in Noida and other parts of the state following the raid. A team from the health department had raided the warehouse of Lovelite vapes in Sector 65 last week and arrested 18 persons. Several boxes of raw materials used to assemble and sell electronic nicotine-based products and cigarettes worth Rs 30-50 lakh were seized. The raid was carried out following complaints from school principals that e-cigarettes are becoming extremely popular among students.What helped the officials in tracking down Lovelite’s warehouse was rave reviews of its products on Google. “We have been trying to track such groups for almost a year now. We posed as decoy customers and placed orders online. On most websites, there is a disclaimer mentioning the states that have banned e-cigarettes. Some, including Lovelite, were selling them illegally in these places. Since the raid, however, the other online sellers have not been responding to queries or purchase requests from Noida,” said Dr Shweta Khurana of the health department, who has been spearheading the drives against tobacco control in the district.Dr Khurana said she had placed a few orders for e-cigarettes in one week on a website that was supposed to send her a payment link through text messages. However, the link never came. “We had placed orders on at least five such popular websites later. Lovelite was just one of them and probably the smallest. We are pretty sure the company was not only assembling and selling nicotine products, but also manufacturing them. There are at least four more such suppliers,” she said.Doctors say e-cigarettes are as harmful as usual tobacco products, though there is a need for more research to ascertain this. However, initial symptoms include nausea, sleeplessness and vomiting.For the raid conducted last week, the health department had followed up on these online suppliers for almost a year.Officials said that though Lovelite was operating under the garb of a software solution provider, its Noida address was verified after reading Google reviews of customers who had visited their office to return or exchange the devices.“The address for Lovelite and one IT company was the same online. It seems that the e-cigarette company was using the IT company’s name as a front. We need to investigate further to get details,” said Shailendra Mishra, city magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Officials from the software company, however, explained that they had no connection with Lovelite except sharing different floors of the same premises.“We are nowhere connected with Lovelite. We are a tenant in the same building occupying a different floor,” said a spokesperson from the IT company.“We sent our officials multiple times to check on the company. The guards kept saying it was a software firm. We continued our online search and found reviews on Google mentioning how good the e-cigarettes were and how prompt the company was in responding to queries and exchanging the device at their office in Noida,” Dr Khurana said. She added that the company claimed to have appointed aeronautical engineers, an expertise that is also required for producing e-cigarettes.The health department is on the lookout for more such companies. “We are now following other leads as suggested by the district magistrate and the chief medical officer. We have sent our staff as decoy customers to over 100 locations to check if e-cigarettes are being sold, especially around schools. Tobacco use among students seems to be on the rise in the district,” said Dr Sunil Dohare, additional chief medical officer.Meanwhile, the 18 arrested employees of Lovelite have been released on bail, but the owner, Tarun Gupta, is in judicial custody. He has been booked under several sections of Drug and Cosmetic Act and IT Act, along with forgery and fraud, officials said.
