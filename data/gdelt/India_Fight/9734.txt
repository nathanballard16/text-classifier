‘We are being neglected’: Cong workers pour out their woes before U T Khader

Hassan, Feb 26: Congress workers in JD(S) bastion Hassan have complained to Urban Development Minister U T Khader that they have been neglected by the coalition government.

No officer listened to party workers, despite the party being the partner in the coalition government, they said.

The Minister was in Hassan to hold a meeting with the public regarding Hassan Urban Development Authority’s projects.

Prior to holding the meeting, he visited the DCC office.

The workers gathered to greet the Minister started to raise their complaints. DCC vice-president Narayana Gowda alleged that Public Works Minister H.D.Revanna had “taken the district administration under his control,” though the coalition government was in power.

There was none to listen to the problems faced by the Congress workers. They were not invited for any government programme, he said.

Mr. Khader said he would convey the opinions of the local workers to senior leaders of the party and would speak to coordination committee chairman Siddaramaiah and Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara.
