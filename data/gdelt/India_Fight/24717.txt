Four more Jet Airways 737s to be deregistered

Jet Airways’ fleet continues to dwindle, with ALAFCO, GECAS and Saroja Aviation submitting applications to deregister three Boeing 737-800s and one -900ER between them.

ALAFCO has requested the deregistration of 737-800s bearing MSNs 39066 and 39065, which are both mortgaged to Nord LB, records from India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation show.

Saroja Aviation, meanwhile, is seeking to take back 737-800 MSN 37960, which is mortgaged to Bank of Baroda’s Hong Kong branch.

Lastly, GECAS is preparing to take back 737-900ER MSN 36539, which is owned by Celestial Aviation Trading 49.

Jet’s situation remains parlous, with a deadline on binding bids to buy the defunct aircraft reportedly set to expire on the afternoon of 10 May.

It is unclear how many – if any – proposals have been submitted by SBI Caps, which is running the process to sell up to a 76% stake in the airline.

SBI Caps is running the sale on behalf of the carrier’s lending consortium, which is led by State Bank of India. The group of banks took control of the carrier in March after a debt-for-equity swap, and initiated the process to find a new strategic investor.

They also signalled plans to advance the carrier Rs15 bilion ($214 million) in emergency funding to keep it operational. After those funds failed to eventuate, the airline suspended operations on 17 April.

Separately, the BSE stock exchange has raised a query with Jet over reports that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has recommended investigating the company over alleged irregularities in its books.

Jet had not responded at the time of publishing.
