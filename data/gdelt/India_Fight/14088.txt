I have decided to begin the task as soon as possible though there are some complications due to Lok Sabha elections and a team cannot be constituted during the polls. But he would focus his aim on the conservation of three rivers and check illegal mining and pollution", Computer Baba told TOI.Baba, who was appointed by the previous BJP government to a five-member committee suggesting ways to conserve river Narmada in April 2018, had crossed swords with the then chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan over ticket distribution during assembly polls.
