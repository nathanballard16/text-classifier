New Delhi, Aug 29 : A man was shot dead by miscreants while his aunt received injuries in the Badarpur area of south Delhi on Wednesday night, the police said on Thursday.

The deceased has been identified as Avinash, a resident of Subhash Camp Aali Vihar, and his aunt as Sheela.

Avinash was declared brought dead and Sheela was undergoing treatment," said Chinmoy Biswal, Deputy commissioner of Police, Southeast.

According to the police, Sheela said they were sitting at their house, when three boys came and started a quarrel with Avinash. During the scuffle, they shot at Avinash and fled the spot.
