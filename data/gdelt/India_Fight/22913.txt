In MP Kirit Somaiya's absence, Marathi votes to play decider in Mumbai North East

86-year-old Gunwantiben Somaiya, the mother of outgoing BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, cast vote along with her family members. Voters weathered heat wave to cast their votes especially between 7 am and 1 pm, but the voter turnout dipped post lunch till 4 pm. BJP initially had to struggle to project Kotak among voters after it had dropped the incumbent MP Kirit Somaiya following strong opposition from ally Shiv Sena. In the absence of any wave, nearly 56.31 per cent polling took place in North East Mumbai where BJP candidate Manoj Kotak is locked in a straight fight against NCP nominee Sanjay Patil. Thereafter, there were long queues until the voting ended at around 6 pm.
