Man stabs estranged wife in family court in Chennai

Woman admitted to hospital

A 44-year-old man, who came to attend proceedings at the Family Court here, stabbed his estranged wife in front of the judge in a crowded room on the Madras High Court campus.

The incident occurred at 11.50 a.m when the proceedings were on in I Additional Family Court at Annex Building of City Civil Court Complex on the High Court campus.

R. Saravanan of Siruvanjur in Sriperumbudur was sitting in a row behind his wife, Varalakshmi. He suddenly drew a knife from his shirt and stabbed her on the neck. Then Saravanan plunged the knife into her chest, before Varalakshmi’s brother pushed him away.

Judge D.Elangovan rose from his seat and asked police personnel outside the hall to take control of the situation. Varalakshmi was rushed to the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital.

Police said Saravanan was employed as a driver with the MTC. In 2009, he had filed a petition seeking divorce from Varalakshmi. In 2011, she filed a petition seeking maintenance from him.

The High Court police arrested Saravanan after booking a case under Sections 307 (Attempt to murder), 294 b (Uttering vulgar word in public place), and 228 (Intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceeding) of the IPC.

The murder attempt left both litigants and lawyers shocked. Senior advocate Sudha Ramalingam said, “It is really shocking that a person came in with a knife and stabbed his wife on the court premises, which is guarded by more police personnel than before. There should be more vigil and screening of visitors.”

Senior advocate Geetha Ramaseshan said, “The administration should take measures to prevent anybody coming inside with a weapon. Everyone must be subject to screening during entry into the court complex. Moreover, the court should not be over crowded and steps must be taken to expedite trial.”
