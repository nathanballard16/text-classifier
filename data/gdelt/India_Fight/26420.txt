Socialist lawmaker: Stop drive-by shootings with 'speed bumps, flower beds'

Is it possible to reduce drive-by shootings by installing speed bumps and flower beds on city streets?

A socialist lawmaker in a major U.S. city thinks so.

Kshama Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party member in Seattle, wants her city to look at these ideas reportedly coming from residents in one area hit hard by gun violence.

"We need common-sense gun-control measures, like banning semi-automatic weapons, to prevent gun violence incidents like the one that happened at 28th and Jackson in the Central District on Friday night," Sawant said on Tuesday during the Seattle City Council Human Services, Equitable, Development, & Renter Rights Committee meeting.

"For example, community members are advocating for traffic-calming measures like raised flower beds or speed bumps on 21st avenue where there have been three drive-by shootings during the current school year. That is alarming."

She says her constituents believe the speed bumps and flower beds "could have a positive impact and help reduce the incidents of drive-by shootings."

Although no one from the city's transportation department was present at the meeting, KING-TV reported a spokesperson for Sawant was told the transportation department did have expertise in "traffic calming measures for the sake of traffic calming," but not for reducing gun violence.

"I personally understand and share the anxiety of my neighbors and desire for safe neighborhoods for our families, especially for our children," Sawant added.

Sawant, who was born in India before coming to America, is said by some Seattle residents to be "more radical" than U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Sawant initiated the push for a $15-per-hour minimum wage, which became a national issue.
