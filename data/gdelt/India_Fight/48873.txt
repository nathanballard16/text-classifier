CM Yogi Adityanath urged to look into rights of ‘living dead’

VARANASI: A farmer and activist fighting for the rights of ‘living dead’, Lal Bihari Mritak of Azamgarh, called on chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow on Tuesday to seek setting up a commission to look into the plight of the ‘living dead’. ‘Living dead’ are people declared dead in revenue records.Lal Bihari, who was officially declared dead between 1976 and 1994, said that the CM has assured to look into the matter.He had gone to meet the CM along with high court lawyer Krishna Kanhaiya Pal.“We submitted a memorandum to the CM urging formation of Jivit Mritak and Dhokhadhari, Bhrastachar, Ghooskhori Nivaran Ayog so that those living persons who have been declared dead in official records can get justice,” said Lal Bihari.Lal Bihari (65) himself remained dead in revenue records for 18 years. He formed Mritak Sangh (Association of Dead) to fight legal battle for such people. “There are scores of such people in the state, and they are running from pillar to post to get themselves declared alive in government records,” he said.Lal Bihari was 21 when he was declared dead in revenue records on July 30, 1976, allegedly at the behest of his relatives who wanted to usurp his property. Since then, he did all that he could possibly do from fighting elections to kidnapping a child to enter into government records. After a struggle of 18 years, he was declared alive on June 30, 1994.
