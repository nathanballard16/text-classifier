However, Vankar returned to her father’s house at Chavaria village around seven months back.Police said that the couple had several issues due to which the deceased left the accused and came back.“We suspect that they were in touch lately and the accused must have forced her to live with him again, but when she denied Tadvi decided to kill him,” said a police official.On the afternoon of August 31, when Vankar was alone at home, Tadvi reached her house. They had a heated argument, following which Tadvi slit her throat using a sharp-edged weapon. When Tadvi was leaving her house in hurry, the woman’s father Valji saw him and even tried to stop him, but he managed to flee from there.
