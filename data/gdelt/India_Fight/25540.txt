According to First News Kannada reports, Darshan has been working out to achieve the body his mythological character requires. He is also growing his hair and beard long to suit the role. Lately, the actor is being spotted carrying this look.

Location Is Finalised

Apparently, the makers of the film have even decided the location for the shoot. They are planning on constructing sets in a village in Chitradurga. Since the film is based on the novel of the same name by B.L. Venu, the team wants to achieve the most realistic version of the kingdom.

Darshan To Start Shooting Soon

Darshan is currently busy shooting for Robert. As per the latest reports, he will start shooting for Gandugali Madakari Nayaka once he wraps up Robert. This is will be his second mythological film after Sangolli Rayanna.

'It Should Create History'

Talking about the film, producer Rockline Venkatesh told in an interview, "Apart from Chitradurga, portions of the film will be shot in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Rajasthan. I feel lucky to have a project like Gandugali Madakari Nayaka coming into my lap, and I see it as a responsibility. A song about Chitradurga in the film Nagarahavu, directed by Putanna Kanagal and featuring Vishnuvardhan, has remained an evergreen track. I am starting off with a hope that Gandugali...too will create history."
