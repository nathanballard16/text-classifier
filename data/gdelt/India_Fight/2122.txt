Fatal crash driver to 'make best of life' outside prison walls

A truck driver who was on a student visa when he killed a grandfather in a Perth crash has avoided going to prison and instead been told by a judge to "make the best of life" as the victim would have wanted.

Amritpal Singh Sidhu, 23, smashed into the back of a car in Banjup in September 2017, crushing it between two trucks and killing 66-year-old Gurbir Singh, who had been visiting family in Perth.

Mr Singh was a rear seat passenger in the car driven by his 22-year-old nephew, who received minor injuries, while Mr Singh's brother suffered a broken leg, the West Australian District Court heard on Thursday.

Judge Gillian Braddock said Sidhu, who is from India, was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but was "not paying sufficient attention" when he failed to slow down with the flow of traffic until the last moment.
