Pakistan labels terror attack as ‘incident’

Islamabad: Neighbouring country Pakistan labelled the ghastly Pulwama terror attack as an incident. Pakistan sought more information and evidence from India on the involvement of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in the attack and the presence of terror camps of the UN-listed terrorist outfit in the country.

Tehmina Janjua, Pakistani Foreign Secretary called Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria to the Foreign Ministry and shared the "preliminary findings" on the "Pulwama incident". It should be noted that the attack was described by Pakistan as “incident”.

In the press release Pakistan stated, “Pakistan has acted with a high sense of responsibility and extended full cooperation. We do so in the interest of regional peace and security. We have sought further information/evidence from India to take the process forward.” The findings were shared with New Delhi after Islamabad examined the dossier on the Pulwama attack.

On February 27, India handed over the dossier to the Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan in New Delhi with key details highlighting the role of JeM in Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel on February 14. In the dossier information about JeM launch pads in Pakistan was also shared with the Pakistani leadership.

Pakistani PM Imran Khan had offered complete cooperation in the investigation if "credible evidence" was provided by India. India, however, termed it “a lame excuse” and said that a dossier of evidence on Mumbai 26/11 was provided but the case has not progressed for the last more than ten years.
