New Delhi: Local traders crashed with security personnel in Delhi's Mayapuri Industrial area after the MDA began its sealing drive Saturday on NGT orders to shut down 850 polluting factories in the area.

Some of the protests reportedly pelted stones at the police during the clashes after which the latter resorted to lathi-charge.

Yesterday, the tribunal came down heavily on Delhi Government and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for failing to implement its earlier order to shut down polluting scrap units in Mayapuri.

NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goyal also criticised the DPCC report on the polluting factories and asked the authorities to produce to show cause as to why proceedings should not be initiated against its officials for failing to carry out the order.

The Delhi Chief Secretary and DPCC Chairman were asked to before the tribunal on May 3. “We direct the (officers) to remain present with a compliance report and to show cause why civil imprisonment of CS and Chairman, DPCC, be not directed,” the Bench said.

The green panel had directed the authorities in Delhi to take active steps to control pollution in Delhi.
