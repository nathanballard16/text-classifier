Couple Arrested For South Delhi Triple Murder, Both Seen On CCTV

The CCTV footage captured the movement of key suspects.

Two days after an elderly couple and their house help were found dead at their home in South Delhi, a 42-year-old woman and her live-in partner were arrested from Gurgaon last night in the triple murder case.

Both the accused, Preeti Sehrawat and Manoj Bhat, 39, knew the elderly couple, said the Crime Branch.

Vishnu Kumar, 80, and his wife, Shishi Mathur, 75, were found murdered at their Vasant Vihar apartment on Sunday. Both of them were retired government officials. Their nursing attendant, Khushboo Nautiyal, 24, who was also killed, was staying with them.

Neighbours alerted the police when they saw blood at the door of the house.

The Crime Branch said they got important clues from a CCTV footage that captured the movement of the two key suspects in the early hours on Sunday. In the footage, the accused were seen wearing helmets.

The accused robbed the house after they killed Vishnu Kumar, his wife and the nursing attendant, who was stabbed 35 times, said the investigators. Khushbu was attacked brutally after she tried to save the elderly couple.

Preeti, a close family friend of the Mathurs, plotted the murder along with her live-in partner. Manoj is an accused in another murder case. Earlier, the local police had suspected that Khushbu was involved in the murder plot; however, the interrogation of the arrested couple revealed they killed the three people to rob the house.
