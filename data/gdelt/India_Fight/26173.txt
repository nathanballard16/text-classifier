Several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were attacked in West Bengal on Sunday -- the last phase of polling of the ongoing Lok Sabha election.

The BJP has alleged that stones were pelted at Kolkata North candidate Rahul Sinha near Park Circus. It added another saffron party leader, Anupam Hazra, candidate from Jadavpur, was also attacked.

Hazra has accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of carrying out the attack.

"TMC goons have beaten up a BJP mandal president, and a driver and have attacked a car. We also rescued our three polling agents. TMC goons were going to carry out rigging at 52 booths. People are eager to vote for BJP but they are not allowing people to vote," Hazra was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.
