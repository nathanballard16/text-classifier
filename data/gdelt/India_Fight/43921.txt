We want Zakir Naik back and working towards it: Jaishankar on Malaysian PM's claim

India has made it clear that it wants the extradition of controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik who has taken permanent residency in Malaysia and is working towards it.

Addressing a press conference in Delhi over completion of 100 days of the government, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, "Let me make it very clear for the record, there is an extradition request for Zakir Naik. We want him back and that is what we are working towards."

Mr Jaishankar's remarks came in response to a question regarding Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's claim that his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi had not asked for Naik to be extradited to India during discussions on the sidelines of Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok earlier this month.

"Not many countries want him (Naik). India has not insisted. I met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he did not ask me that he wants this man back. This man could be troublesome for India," Mahathir said in an interview with a Malaysian radio station.

Jaishankar contradicted the Malaysian Prime Minister, saying that the issue was discussed during the meeting in Russia.

"My understanding of Vladivostok meeting was, that Zakir naik issue did come up and the expectation was communicated from our side that officials concerned should meet quickly and sort out this matter to our satisfaction," Jaishankar said.

India had sent its extradition request in January of 2018 to Malaysia and "from January 2018, we have been persistently and relentless pursuing this matter at all levels" the minister explained.

India-born Zakir Naik is wanted in India for his hate speeches. Agencies in India launched multiple probes against Naik after it was reported that terrorists involved with 2016 Dhaka attack were inspired by his speeches.
