Rahul Gandhi blames BJP for JeM chief Masood Azhar’s release

Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for releasing terror outfit JeM chief Masood Azhar in 1999.

Addressing a public rally here in north Karnataka, Rahul asked PM Modi to tell the nation that it was the BJP government which released JeM chief from an Indian jail.

“Few days ago, our soldiers were martyred in Pulwama. Who sent Masood Azhar, who was responsible for Pulwama terror attack, back to Pakistan? It was BJP,” Rahul said.

“Ajit Doval, who is the National Security Advisor for the Modi Govt, escorted head of JeM Masood Azhar back to Pakistan. We are not like Narendra Modi, we don’t bow down to terrorists,” Rahul added.

The Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack in which at least 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

JeM head Azhar was released by India in exchange for hijacked Indian Airlines passengers in 1999 during the Vajpayee government.

Continuing his attack, Rahul alleged, “while Modi talked about corruption, the whole country knew he was corrupt.”

“I raised few important questions on Rafale in the Parliament. Why was Anil Ambani given the deal? And why was HAL sidelined, stealing many job opportunities from the youth of Karnataka?” Rahul questioned.

The Congress president said that BJP wants to divide the nation into two parts. One for people like Anil Ambani, Mehul Choksi and the other for poor farmers, labourers and the marginalised. “We want one nation where everyone gets justice,” Rahul added.

Rahul said that the ruling alliance of Congress and JD(S) in Karnataka will fight the upcoming Lok Sabha elections together and win it.
