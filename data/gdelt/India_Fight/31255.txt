Dishank Arora steps into Rrahul Sudhir’s shoes to play the lead in 'Rajaa Betaa'

Actor Dishank Arora , who was last seen in ' Jiji Maa ', has been roped in to play the male lead in ' Rajaa Betaa ' ('RB'). We had earlier reported that Rrahul Sudhir , the original male lead of RB, had quit the show because of his mother’s failing health.Dishank says, “I’m excited, as this is one of the few male-oriented shows on Indian television. I have started watching the show to understand Dr Vedant (his character), and will add my own touch while staying true to the character. I hope that people will accept me in the role.”The actor is looking forward to shooting in Jaipur. “It will be a welcome change. After shooting a few sequences of my previous show in the Pink City, I feel a strong connect with it. Since I’m a foodie, I’m also and keen on trying out the local food.”
