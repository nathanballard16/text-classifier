Vadodara: Two kill uncle for murdering father 19 years ago

VADODARA: A labourer was arrested while his minor cousin was detained on Thursday for murdering their uncle as revenge killing in Chhota Udepur late last month.The duo, Dehla Rathwa and his cousin, strangled their uncle Naraliya Rathwa (56) to death on the banks of Orsang river near Bhordali village. Cops said Naraliya had killed Dehla’s father 19 years ago. Naraliya’s murder came to light when post-mortem revealed that he was strangulated to death. The cousins then admitted before a villager that they were responsible for his death.Police said that Naraliya had gone missing since September 26 evening following which his son Ramesh had lodged a missing person’s complaint at Rangpur police station. Two days later his body was found on the banks of Orsang river at Timli village.“The body was taken to Chhota Udepur general hospital for post-mortem, but the doctors asked us to take it to SSG Hospital so that forensic experts can also examine it,” said sub-inspector D M Vasava of Rangpur police station.The post-mortem and forensic report revealed that Naraliya was first strangled to death before being thrown in to the river. During those days, Orsang river was in spate and so the body was carried many kilometres away. As the cops were searching for the killers, Dehla and his cousin spilled the beans in front of a villager, who informed the cops. Based on suspicion, cops picked up the duo for questioning and arrested Dehla and detained the boy when they admitted to their crime.“Dehla had a grudge against his uncle for killing his father, but he has not said why he decided to take revenge after so many years,” Vasava added.
