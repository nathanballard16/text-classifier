Kulbhushan Jadhav case: Making its final arguments at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Wednesday, India urged the top UN court to annul the decision of Pakistani military court awarding death sentence to ex-Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav and direct fair trial in a civilian court. It also asked the court to grant full consular access to Jadhav.

In the first round of submissions, senior advocate Harish Salve, representing India, urged the ICJ to annul Jadhav’s death sentence and order his immediate release. “Military Courts of Pakistan cannot command the confidence of this Court and should not be sanctified by a direction to them to review and reconsider the case,” he said.

Responding to India’s argument, Pakistan called India’s demand for acquittal, release and return of Jadhav as “outlandish”.
