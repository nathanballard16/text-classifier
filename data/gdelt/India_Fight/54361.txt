New Delhi, December 6

The rapists and killers of Nirbhaya are likely to be hanged soon as the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sent its recommendation to the President rejecting the mercy plea filed by one of the accused.

Officials in the MHA said the ministry after processing the Delhi Government’s recommendation rejecting the mercy plea of one of the convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape case has endorsed the decision and sent it to President Ram Nath Kovind for his consideration.

The move came two days after the file rejecting the mercy plea was sent to the MHA by Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal.

The file has been forwarded to the President for consideration and final decision. Vinay Sharma, one of the convicts facing the gallows for the rape-and-murder of a 23-year-old paramedic student, had filed the mercy petition before the President.

Nirbhaya was gangraped on December 16, 2012. She later succumbed to her injuries. The brutality of the rape had rocked the nation leading to massive protests.

The rejection of the mercy plea of the Nirbhaya gangrape comes at a time when there is nationwide outrage over the gangrape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad.
