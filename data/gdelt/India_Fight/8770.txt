New Delhi, February 22

The Congress today launched an all-out attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to disclose his schedule and whereabouts for February 14, the day of the Pulwama attack.

While Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to take a swipe at the PM saying “Prime Time PM continued with his photo-shoot as 40 CRPF jawans laid down their lives”, the party separately fielded former minister Manish Tewari to question Modi.

“We want to ask the PM where he was between 3.10 pm when the news of the Pulwama attack broke and 5.10 pm when he addressed a rally on his mobile without mentioning the Pulwana tragedy,” Tewari, Congress spokesman, said a day after Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed the Congress for “speaking like Pakistan”.

Arguing that hard questions strengthened, not weakened, national security, he said either the PM was aware of the attack but continued with his shoot, which is “extremely insensitive”, or he was incommunicado and didn’t know about it, which is even “more frightening”. — TNS

Was it that the PM knew of the tragedy and continued to be ‘Commander Corbett’ shooting for Discovery Channel or was it that the PM did not know an attack had happened? — Manish Tewari, Cong spokesman
