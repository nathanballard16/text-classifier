The DEO according to a report in the Indian Express is learnt to have said in its report that the statement was a violation and the same was submitted to the Chief Electoral Officer of Maharashtra.

Now the Election Commission (EC) would take a final call on the matter. If the EC agrees with the views of the DEO, then Modi could be asked to explain his remarks for violation of the Model Code of Conduct. A decision is expected to be taken this week, the report also added.
