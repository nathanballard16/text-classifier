NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 government force personnel were wounded on Tuesday after Naxals triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeting them in eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, officials said.

The attack was carried out in Kuchai area of Saraikela Kharsawan district, about 140 km south of Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand.

"Early today at around 5:00 a.m. local time, Naxals triggered an IED here targeting a joint contingent of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and police, wounding 11 personnel," a police official said. "The joint team was carrying out a search operation in the area," the police added.

According to officials, of the 11 wounded personnel, eight belonged to CRPF's special jungle warfare unit - Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA), while three are policemen.

Officials said the wounded personnel were airlifted to Ranchi for treatment.

Following the attack, a massive search operation was launched to trace the attackers. However, reports said the Naxals managed to escape.

Earlier this month, 15 policemen and a driver were killed after Naxals triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeting their vehicle in India's western state of Maharashtra.
