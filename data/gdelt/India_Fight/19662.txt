Kazakhstan to have early presidential vote: Kazakhstan's interim president has ordered an early presidential election after the unexpected resignation of Nursultan Nazarbayev last month. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who became the acting head of state when Nazarbayev resigned, said in a televised address that the vote will be held June 9. Tokayev has not said whether he intends to seek the presidency. Pundits see him and Nazarbayev's eldest daughter as the two most likely candidates to succeed Nazarbayev.
