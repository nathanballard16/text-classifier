Team Street Dancer 3D with Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor is back for rehearsals and we’re super excited : Bollywood News

Street Dancer 3D, starring Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor, is being said to be the biggest dance film India has ever made and we can vouch for it. The team looks bigger and better than ever and Remo D’Souza’s latest Instagram post proves that. The team wrapped up their London’s shooting schedule almost a month ago and are now all set to resume work with a bang. They are all smiles as they pose after a hearty dance session.

The team had a blast in London as they even shot for a song on the rooftop of the famous O2 Arena. After the schedule wrap up, they threw a massive wrap up party to celebrate the pack up and then the leads went on to resume work for their other ventures. Looks like, we can expect a lot of pictures and videos from another fun-filled shooting schedule. Street Dancer 3D is the third instalment of the ABCD franchise and is going to have a dance-off between Shraddha Kapoor and Nora Fatehi. Remo uploaded the picture with the caption, “The TEAM IS BACK :) #streetdancer3d #sd3 @varundvn @shraddhakapoor @salmanyusuffkhan @sushi1983 @rahuldid @iamkrutimahesh @jhavartika @pravin_bhosale @dharmesh0011 @raghavjuyal @punitjpathakofficial @niveditaasharma @pery_sheetal17 @poppinticko @gabrieldsouzaaa @lizelleremodsouza @rohitfictitious @vinay @tseries.official”
