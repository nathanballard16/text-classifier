Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba not terrorists, why arrest them: Mamata Banerjee

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has slammed the Centre for declaring Jammu and Kashmir a Union Territory in an undemocratic way without taking the opinion of other political parties or holding a vote.

Speaking to the media before leaving for Chennai to meet DMK president MK Stalin, Mamata Banerjee said, "I am talking about the procedure in which these resolutions were adopted. We cannot support this bill, neither can we vote for it. What they have done is is not democratic."

She added, "They should have discussed the matter in an all-party meeting before taking such a step."

The Trinamool Congress chief also slammed the Centre for arresting former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Mehbooba Mufti on Monday night.

"They are political personalities and not terrorists. They should be released immediately. The Centre should build confidence among people and not create panic," she said.

Banerjee also proposed peaceful negotiation and resolution of the matter.

In a swift move of Monday, the Modi government scrapped Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

The Centre also moved a bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.

Several regional parties extended their support to BJP, clearing a smooth passage for the resolutions and the bill in Rajya Sabha.

Amit Shah has now taken up the matter in Lok Sabha for deliberation.

Meanwhile, situation remains tense in Jammu and Kashmir. However, Army and J&K Police have said that the situation on ground is peaceful.
