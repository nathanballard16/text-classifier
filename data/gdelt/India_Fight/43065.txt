8 Lashkar men held in J&K for circulating threat posters

SRINAGAR: Even as curfew-like restrictions were reimposed in several parts of Kashmir to foil any plans on taking out Muharram processions, J&K police on Tuesday arrested eight Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives, who were involved in threatening residents of Sopore in south Kashmir. Muharram processions have been banned in Kashmir since 1990 when armed insurgency began.Commercial hub of Lal Chowk and adjoining areas were completely sealed off by placing concertina wires at all entry points where large number of security force personnel were deployed, officials said.Restrictions have been in several parts of Kashmir as a precautionary measure for maintaining law and order in the Valley, they said.Despite restrictions, Muharram processions were peacefully held in some Shia-dominated areas of Budgam district.Sopore SSP Javid Iqbal said the arrested Lashkar operatives — Aijaz Mir, Omar Mir, Tawseef Najar, Imitiyaz Najar, Omar Akbar, Faizan Latief, Danish Habib and Showkat Ahmad Mir — were assigned the task of making and circulating posters threatening people against carrying out normal activities. The eight were being handled by three Lashkar terrorists namely Sajjad alias Hyder, Asif Maqbool Bhat and Mudasir Pandit. Computers and other accessories used for making the posters have been recovered from their possession, Iqbal added.Terrorists have already tried to instil fear in Kashmiris by attacking the family of one fruit trader, Hamidullah Rather, of Dangerpora in Sopore on September 5 evening. In this attack, three men and a 30-month-old baby girl were injured.Before this attack, terrorists had on August 29 killed 65-year-old Ghulam Mohammad of Parimpora on Srinagar outskirts for keeping his grocery shop open. These two incidents created so much fear among the residents that it resulted in total shutdown of shops and business establishments in the Valley, sources said.Restrictions were first imposed across Kashmir on August 5 when the Centre announced its decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories. The restrictions were lifted in phases from many parts of the Valley as the situation improved with passage of time.The authorities have been imposing restrictions in vulnerable areas of the Valley every Friday, apprehending that vested interests might exploit the large gatherings at big mosques and shrines to fuel protests.Meanwhile, normal life remained severely affected in Kashmir due to shutdown in the Valley, which entered 37th day on Tuesday.Markets and other business establishments remained closed while public transport was off the roads across the Valley, the officials said.
