Hurriyat (m) Conference on Monday paid tributes to slain civilian Waseem Ahmed Mir, and slain militants Ishfaq Majid Mir and his associate who were killed during an encounter at Babagund area of Handwara with the government forces.

The spokesman said that it was the direct outcome of Delhi’s repressive measures that Kashmir’s young generation was forced to choose militancy.

The Hurriyat chairman strongly condemned the use of hundreds of mortar shells by the government forces under the garb of finishing the operation with the result at least a dozen residential houses at encounter site have been turned into heaps of rubble.

The Hurriyat said that whenever people tried to stage peaceful protests and raise voice against the government violence, “military might” is used to silence them.

Condemning the widespread wave of CASOs across the length and breadth of south and northern Kashmir areas, the Hurriyat said laced with the unbridled powers including the black laws, like AFSPA the government forces are committing serious human rights violations.
