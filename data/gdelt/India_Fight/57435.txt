Amitabh Bachchan takes big break

The actor skipped the National Awards function, where he was to receive the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke award.

Is Amitabh Bachchan unwell again? His decision to skip the National Awards function in New Delhi on Tuesday — where he was to receive the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke award — has again raised concerns regarding his health among his well-wishers and fans.

Amidst debate about whether it is a routine fever or something more, we hear that the truth lies somewhere in between. While it is true that he’s down with a fever and cold, it is also a fact that doctors have advised the family to not allow him to travel unless necessary.

An enraged close family friend said: “Of course, Amit ji was very keen to be in New Delhi for this very special occasion, but he has caught a chill, thanks to days of shooting in minus-zero temperature in Slovakia for a film (Chehre). Directors need to understand the fragility of his health and stop putting him through such gruelling climatic conditions. His body can’t take it any longer.”

Surely Bachchan can put an end to such punishing shooting?

The friend says he wouldn’t compromise his professionalism. “No, he would never say no to being professional. The script demanded the shooting in Slovakia, but it was up to the makers to make the changes,” the friend shrugs.
