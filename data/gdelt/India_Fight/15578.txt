VP Naidu urges UN to evolve common strategy to combat terrorism

Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], Mar 17 (ANI): Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday called upon the United Nations to evolve a common strategy to combat terrorism and speedily conclude the deliberations on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.

Speaking at an event here, the Vice President said that the “horrific shooting of defenceless worshippers in New Zealand once again highlighted the need for all countries to come together to eliminate the scourge of terrorism.”

“It is a global challenge which requires a global response. No country is immune to these threats,” he was quoted, as saying in an official statement.

Pointing out that India had been a victim of violence and facing the menace of cross-border terrorism for the past many decades, Vice President Naidu expressed his disappointment over China’s decision to block the proposal of UN Security Council to list Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

“This once again underlines the need for expanding the Security Council,” he said.

The Vice President announced that he would undertake a nationwide campaign to promote rule of law and peace, strengthen democracy, fight corruption, create greater awareness on sustainable development and encourage social harmony, the statement added.

Naidu was speaking at a felicitation function organized in Hyderabad following the conferment of Doctor Honoris Causa upon him by the Peace University of Costa Rica in recognition of his contribution to the rule of law, democracy, sustainable development, and peace. (ANI)
