Indian PM Modi praises party workers for their courage amid election killings

VARANASI, India (AFP) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised his nationalist party's courage on Monday (May 27) amid political clashes and killings after his latest landslide election triumph.

Three workers from Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been killed and there have been pitched battles between BJP activists and a rival regional party in West Bengal state since Modi secured a new five-year term last week.

Thousands of supporters lined the streets of his political bastion of Varanasi, waving flags, chanting his name and throwing flower petals at his cavalcade, despite the 40 deg C heat.

"Why are our workers being killed and attacked in Kashmir, Kerala or Bengal," Modi said.

"It is shameful and anti-democratic," he added.

A close aide of BJP minister Smriti Irani was shot dead by gunmen on a motorbike in the Amethi district of Uttar Pradesh state on Saturday night (May 25).

Irani won the Amethi seat from opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.
