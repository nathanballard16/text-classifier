Bargari closure report: Congress loses sting to attack Akalis

JALANDHAR: During a charged debate in the Punjab assembly on August 28, 2018 over Justice Ranjit Singh Commission report, incumbent Congress and principal opposition AAP had sought justice in the Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan police firing cases. A year on as the assembly's monsoon session starts on Friday, there has been little progress in the Bargari sacrilege case. This despite the fact that the issue has remained at the political centre stage all along right from the 2017 assembly elections in Punjab, and the 2019 parliamentary polls.The Bargari sacrilege, which led to police firing at Behbal Kalan in which two persons were killed, has moved backward with CBI filing a closure report. The firing case being probed by the state government appointed special investigation team (SIT) has progressed.Sacrilege issue was raised strongly by the Congress in both the elections. After the 2017 polls, Shiromani Akali Dal was relegated to third position in the state assembly. Even in the 2019 general elections, despite its alliance partner BJP's good performance, SAD lost eight out of 10 seats it contested and trailed in most of the rural segments having significance presence of Sikh voters.Last year in the assembly, the Congress was on offensive while attacking SAD. Now, the closure report has come as a setback for the incumbent Congress as the government could not withdraw the case from CBI despite a unanimous resolution passed by the assembly."After using the issue in two elections, we have lost the sting from our attacks significantly after this closure report. Ironically, SAD is now hitting back while waving the closure report at us," a Congress MLA said.On the other hand, SAD now appears to be on the offensive and has even sought extension of the assembly session.After getting a legal opinion from Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda, the government had issued a notification on September 6, 2018, for withdrawing the case from CBI and then also wrote to the Union government.Punjab rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who had given a very emotional speech in the assembly and then moved a resolution to withdraw the sacrilege and firing cases from CBI, said he did not track the efforts by the state government as the home department was with the chief minister Amarinder Singh When asked, CM's media adviser Raveen Thukral said the state government wrote to the Centre for withdrawing the case from CBI as it was in its domain, but the Union government did not permit that.
