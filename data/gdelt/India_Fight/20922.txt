PM Narendra Modi: Sharad Pawar fled after seeing sea of saffron

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a frontal attack on NCP President Sharad Pawar in Akluj, Maharashtra on Wednesday. The PM said that seeing the saffron sea of supporters for BJP, the NCP patriarch decided to flee from the election battlefield and not fight.

The PM felicitated NCP veteran Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil for completing 50 years in public life and completing 75 years. It is interesting to note that Mohite-Patil rejected NCP’s offer to contest the Madha seat from where he is the sitting MP. Mohite-Patil’s son Ranjitsinh recently joined the BJP, but he has not been given candidature by BJP in this constituency.

Praising Mohite-Patil, the PM said, “If a person has put five decades of his life in public life one should appreciate it keeping aside political differences. When one hugs someone like this, people draw inferences but I appreciate his work.”

Taking a dig at Pawar and the Gandhi family, PM Modi said, “Whatever I have become today. It is because of family system and family values. I would like to tell Pawar that currently he is busy serving just one family from Delhi.”

The PM slammed Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying, “After the Chowkidar chor hai campaign, the Congress has realised that people believe in the chowkidar. I come from a backward caste, these people criticise me. But they should not drag entire community or call all the Modis as chor.”
