Justice at last Barasat Court convicts Manua Ajit after 23 month trial

Kolkata: The Barasat Fourth Fast Track Court on Thursday convicted Manua Majumdar and her paramour for carrying out the cold-blooded murder of Anupam Singha, Majumdar's husband. The court held Majumdar guilty for conspiring with her lover Ajit Roy to perform the crime, while Roy has been convicted for executing it. Several friends and relatives of Singha also gathered outside the court with posters and placards, demanding the highest possible punishment for the convicted duo. On May 3, Majumdar, a casual staff at Barasat municipality, left work early to meet her boyfriend Roy at her house. Roy hit Singha on the head with an iron rod and then slashed his veins with a knife to ensure his death.
