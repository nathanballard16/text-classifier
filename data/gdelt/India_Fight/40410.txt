NEW DELHI - An Indian police officer and a militant were killed in an encounter in restive India-controlled Kashmir, police said on Wednesday.

The encounter between the security forces and armed militants began on Tuesday evening continued till Wednesday morning in Baramulla district, about 70 km west of Srinagar city, the summer capital of India-controlled Kashmir.

Police said that a Special Police Officer (SPO) was killed while another cop was injured in an encounter.

"Encounter is over. One terrorist killed. Identity being ascertained. Arms and ammunition recovered. Our colleague SPO Billal attained martyrdom. Sub-Inspector (SI) Amardeep Parihar injured in the incident is being treated at Army Hospital," police said on twitter on Wednesday.

This was the first encounter between security forces and militants ever since the Indian government on Aug 5 abrogated Article 370 of the Indian constitution which had guaranteed a "special status" to the troubled region.

A separatist movement and guerrilla war challenging New Delhi's rule is going on in the restive region since 1989.
