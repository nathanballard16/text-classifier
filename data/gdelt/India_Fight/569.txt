New Delhi: Senior advocate HS Phoolka, who on Thursday resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party, hit out at the AAP on Friday, saying converting an anti-corruption movement into a political party in 2012 was "wrong". He further dismissed contesting the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

The former Punjab MLA told that media that in today’s scenario, it was significant to have a movement which was initiated by activist Anna Hazare in 2012. He further said that all those who left the AAP and others should come under one umbrella parallel to political parties.

"Converting anti-corruption movement into a political party in 2012 was wrong," opined Phoolka, adding: “I will not contest Lok Sabha election although, after the conviction of Sajjan Kumar, people in Punjab said I could easily win from any seat."

He added: “We should raise a movement like Anna Hazare. Many who have left AAP and others including lawyers, doctors need to unite to form an organisation parallel to political parties…We will form a big organisation within six months."

Notably, the AAP was formed by Arvind Kejriwal and others following the Anna Hazare-led anti-graft movement. Phoolka had joined AAP in 2014.

Phoolka's resignation came amidst speculation of a likely alliance between AAP and Congress for the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections.
