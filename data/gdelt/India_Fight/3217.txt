Kolkata: Hours after CBI conducted raids at the residence of former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Trinamool Congress took a jibe at the BJP and said that the saffron has a new ally CBI. The CBI on Friday carried out raids at the residence of Hooda in Rohtak and other officials, in connection with alleged irregularities in the acquisition of land in Haryana, following which, the opposition parties accused the BJP of using probe agencies for their own profit.

Earlier today, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee criticised the BJP for using "Government agencies as allies".

“So political vendetta continues. BJP and its ‘allies' comprising multiple Government agencies harassing all allies of Oppn from Kolkata to Delhi and beyond. From @yadavakhilesh to Behen Mayawati Ji, nobody is spared. From north to south. From east to west. Political vendetta by BJP. Are they scared? Are they desperate ?” Mamata tweeted.

Without making any reference to any agency Mamata said, “One headless agency has now become spineless BJP!”

Meanwhile, Hooda termed the CBI raids against him as “political vendetta” and added that he has complete faith in the judiciary of the country.

Hooda’s son Deepender, who represents Congress from Rohtak, blamed the Centre for targeting his family and said that the saffron party is targeting popular leaders from the opposition.

The CBI also lodged a fresh case against the former Haryana chief minister in connection with the alleged irregularities in the acquisition of land in Haryana following raids at 20 places including in Chandigarh, Rohtak, New Delhi, Gurgaon and Mohali.
