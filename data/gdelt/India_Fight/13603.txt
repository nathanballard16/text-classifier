New Delhi: Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru's son, Galib Guru has expressed anger after he was portrayed as a 'proud Indian' citizen in several media reports run by the 'Afzal Premi Gang'.

Slamming media reports, he said that they tried to manipulate whatever he had said.

"If I have an Aadhaar card why can't I have a passport. I want the passport as I want to apply for scholarships abroad," Galib added.
