SAD condemns Congress minister for hurting religious sentiments of Sikhs

LUDHIANA: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) condemned Congress minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu for hurting the religious sentiments of the Sikh community by attacking a Sikh youth and disrespecting Sikh religious symbols and demanded an immediate case be registered against the minister as well as other persons responsible for this dastardly act.In a statement on Sunday, former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said it was shocking that cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had attacked the ‘kesh’ and ‘dastar’ of a Sikh youth Gursewak Singh Gora of Baddowal in Dakha assembly constituency with the sole purpose of humiliating him. “We condemn this dastardly act and demand that the law should be followed and a case should be registered against Ashu for hurting the religious sentiments of an Amritdhari Sikh,” he said.The Akali leader also made it clear that the SAD was not concerned about the politics of the case or the factional fight in the Congress party which had led to this incident. “Our only concern is that a cabinet minister has intentional launched an attack on one of the ‘kakaar’ and no action has been taken against him as per law. Prompt action should be taken in the case or the SAD would be constrained to launch an agitation to secure justice in the matter,” he added.Grewal said the case also proved the anti-Sikh nature of the Congress party and its leaders. “They have no qualm in attacking the five ‘kakaars’ which are sacred to the Sikh community. Even after doing so they have no shame or remorse for their heinous conduct. The SAD will not remain silent and will ensure those guilty of this sacrilege are punished as per the law of the land”, he added.
