A twisted farmer has been filmed using his JCB tractor to kill a bull by snapping the creature's spine in half.

Horror footage, filmed in Pune, India, captured the man chasing the bull around a muddy yard.

He then brings the machine's fork scoop down onto the bull's back.

The animal desperately attempts to flee but becomes pinned down by the machine.

Its metal forks skewer the bull's back, forcing the creature to the ground.

Onlookers can be heard screaming during the incident but the man shows no remorse and persists in forcing the creature down.

One man attempted to rescue the bull and was seen yanking at a rope attached to the creature.

Despite the bull appearing to be dead, the digger driver kept the fork embedded into the creature's body.

The horrified cameraman walks in nearer to the bull appearing to show the creature's rib having been broken.

After being uploaded online, thousands have been left outraged.

Animal rights activists have demanded that the accused face the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

One person said: "How cruel is this person?"

Another added: "This is very disturbing."

A third described the clip as being "very sad".

Police were reported by local media to have arrested two individuals in connection with the attack, who have since absconded.

It comes after a girl sawed a dachshund's legs off in a "horrific animal cruelty" ordeal leaving the dog crippled.
