White car gang targets Chandigarh woman

Ludhiana: The white car women gang struck again, targeting a Chandigarh resident near Kohara on Tuesday.

This is the third such incident this year in the city.

Kanchan Sharma, 45, said in her police complaint, “I reached Ludhiana from Chandigarh by bus on Tuesday afternoon. I am here to visit my relatives. After alighting from the bus at Kohara bus stand, I was waiting for an auto-rickshaw when a white car stopped near me. A man was at the wheel and three women on the passenger seats.”

The women started talking to her. “After sometime, they offered to drop me at my destination. I agreed and sat in the car. Minutes later, one of the women said she was feeling pukish and leaned on me. The trio then asked me to get down. As soon as I did, the car sped away. I then realised that my gold chain was missing.”

Focal Point police station assistant sub-inspector Surjit Singh said a case has been registered under sections 379-B (snatching) 420 (cheating) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. “We are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras to trace the accused,” he added.
