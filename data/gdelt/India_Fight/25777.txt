Man Killed Over Allegation of Cow Smuggling in Kashmir

Injured cows are seen in the back of a truck that a 'cow vigilante' group chased down on November 8, 2015 in Ramgarh, Rajasthan, India. The local 'cow vigilante' group, headed by Nawal Kishore Sharma, is one of dozens of such hard line Hindu cow protection vigilante groups operating across India. The members work various day jobs such as teachers, lawyers, marble sculptors, politicians and by night they patrol on watch for smugglers illegally transporting cows for sale and slaughter. Many also work at the cow shelters where the rescued cows are taken. (Allison Joyce/Getty Images)
