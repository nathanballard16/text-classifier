Sansani: Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster: Detailed report on Vikas Chaudhary's murder

A day after Congress Haryana spokesperson Vikas Chaudhary was shot dead in Faridabad, the security has been beefed up at Badshah Khan Hospital, considering the unrest and angst among party men after the incident.



Fearing violence post brutal murder of the Congress spokesperson, heavy police force has been deployed. The mortal remains have still been kept in hospital mortuary as the family members didn’t take the body home on Thursday.
