Decoration material gutted in house fire at Navapura

Firemen doused the flames within an hour, but the house was damaged by then

Vadodara: A minor fire broke out in a house at Jainagar Society on RV Desai Road on Thursday morning.

Rooms on first floor of the house owned by Bharat Kanani were gutted as decoration and tent materials stored there caught fire. Fire officials said that the fire could have been sparked due to short-circuit as the wiring in the house was very old.

As the residents of the house living on the ground floor realized that the first floor was ablaze, they rushed out and informed fire brigade.

Firemen doused the flames within an hour, however, the damage was done by then. A fire official said that due to presence of decoration and tent materials, the fire spread quickly on the floor and everything was gutted.

Vadodara mayor Dr Jigisha Sheth also reached the spot after learning about the incident.

Firemen had to initially face problems as the locals had gathered around Kanani’s building to take photographs and record videos on their mobile phones.
