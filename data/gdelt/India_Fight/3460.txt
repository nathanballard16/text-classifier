Massive fire at party plot, no casualties

SURAT: A major fire in a party plot on Surat-Dumas Road caused massive damage to the property here on Saturday. However, there were no casualties. Fire Brigade officials said the fire started at around 10am near the gate of Swarna Bhumi Party Plot. Around 150 people were working to set up the marriage mandap when the fire broke out reducing to ash sofas, chairs and other material. Nine firefighting vehicles from Majura fire station reached the spot but by then all inflammable material at the party plot for a marriage function had gone up in flames. One firefighting vehicle each of Essar and ONGC too had reached the site. It took firefighters more than two hours to douse the fire. A short-circuit is believed to have caused the fire in the party plot owned by Odhav Patel.“The marriage function had not yet started. Arrangements were still being made for the function when the fire broke out. There were many cooking gas cylinders in the kitchen. However, we removed the gas cylinders before they exploded along with people at the party plot,” said Haribhau Boraste, fire officer, Majura fire station.Basant Parikh, chief fire officer, told TOI, “The party plot just had a few fire extinguishers. Flame retardants and other equipment that could have helped to extinguish the fire were not there. The party plot owner had not taken no objection certificate from the fire department after 2014. We will issue him a notice. The party plot will only be allowed to reopen after it complies with the fire safety rules.”The financial loss due to the fire is worth several lakhs. The actual loss is yet to be assessed by the party plot owner and the marriage decorator, sources said.
