PA hails UN report on Israeli response to Gaza riots, but says it isn’t enough

The Palestinian Authority welcomes the UN Human Rights Council report saying IDF forces may have committed crimes against humanity in its response to weekly Gaza border riots over the past year, but says it doesn’t go far enough in establishing accountability.

Ahmad Shami, a spokesperson for PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, says the probe “is a right step in the right direction, yet is not enough for establishing comprehensive accountability. The international community must take its responsibility and provide international protection for the Palestinian citizens in every inch of Occupied Palestine.”

“We urge the international community and all United Nations related institutions to oblige Israel to commit to the fourth Geneva Convention and uphold its legal obligations as a belligerent occupant to protect the Palestinian citizens under its military control,” Shami adds.
