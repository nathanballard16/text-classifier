Around two weeks ago, Kriti was making headlines with her sensual Femina India photoshoot. The actress gave us a glimpse to her alluring side as fans went gaga over her.

On the work front, Sanon's 'Arjun Patiala' hit the theatres on August 2 and opened up to mixed reviews. While the actress and her co-stars Diljit Dosanjh and Varun Sharma's performance was lauded, many felt that the film lacked in terms of content. It clashed with Hollywood biggie 'Fast and Furious presents: Hobbs and Shaw'.

Kriti is also a part of Ashutosh Gowarikar's ambitious project 'Panipat'. The film also stars Sanjay Dutt and Arjun Kapoor and is slated to release in December this year.
