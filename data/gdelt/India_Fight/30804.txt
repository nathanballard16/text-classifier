Amaravati: After losing power in Andhra Pradesh, former state chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is also on the verge of losing his river-side residence. On Tuesday, an MLA of the ruling YSR Congress Party said the TDP president would be evicted from the Undavalli house situated on the banks of Krishna river.

Legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy said the house was built on the river bed.

Responding to the claim, the Telugu Desam Party said the new government was practising vindictive politics. TDP leader P Keshav said it was wrong for the YSRCP MLA to make such remarks as the matter was still sub-judice.

Naidu had moved into the Undavalli house in 2016 when the state’s administration was shifted to Amaravati from Hyderabad, which is now the capital of Telangana. Naidu had been using the residence, named 'Praja Vedika', as his official accommodation as the CM of Andhra Pradesh.

In the recently-concluded Assembly Elections in the state, the party lost power to YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s YSR Congress Party.

After his loss in the election, Naidu had written a letter to the state government asking for permission to continue to use the 'Praja Vedika' residence for official engagements.

However, the YSRCP legislator’s remarks make it amply clear that the state government is not inclined to accept that request.

As Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Naidu enjoys the rank of a Cabinet minister.

Reddy meanwhile said that he would continue his fight against unauthorised constructions, especially those on river beds - including TDP chief’s house.
