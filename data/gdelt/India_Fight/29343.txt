Six convicted over notorious Indian gang rape

In an ordeal lasting five days, she was sedated and held in a Hindu temple, repeatedly raped and then strangled and beaten to death.

The six Hindu men were due to be sentenced later, prosecution lawyer Mubeen Farooqui told reporters outside the court in Pathankot, in Punjab state.

They face the death penalty with a minimum of life imprisonment.

A seventh man was acquitted while an eighth person, who was underage, faces a separate trial.

"We have not yet got a copy of the judgement yet and will have to wait for details," defence lawyer Ankur Sharma said.

"Six of the accused have been found guilty and one has been acquitted."

Police wary of protests

The case sparked two days of violent protests in Jammu and demonstrations in several other places across India, including in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.

Jammu and Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state, but the southern Jammu region - where the rape and murder took place - is Hindu-dominated.

On Monday hundreds of police were on duty in Pathankot for the trial.

Wary of new protests, security was also heavy in Kathua town and surrounding Muslim areas.
