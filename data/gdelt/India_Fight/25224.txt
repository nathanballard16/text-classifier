Ranbir Kapoor on clashing with Aamir Khan at the box-office



Ranbir Kapoor recently returned from his Europe tour with girlfriend Alia Bhatt and soon after he attended an event in Mumbai where the actor was at his candid best. He broke his silence on postponing the release date of his next film, Ayan Mukherjee's ambitious project, Brahmastra and how Luv Ranjan's film starring him will release post that.





Produced by Karan Johar, Brahmastrs was slated to release in coming December but now it's postponed to Summer 2020. Talking about the same, he said, "We're working on Brahmastra from last six years. Ayan has worked really hard. He and everybody involved have given their life to the film, Alia, Mr Bachchan, Pritam, Karan and myself. We really want to make the film to the best of its capabilities. It's unfortunate that we could not make the December release date because of various reasons like computer graphics, the CGI would not have been ready."



He added, "So, it's sad my film will release after a two-year gap (Sanju released in 2018) and I think it's not a good thing for an actor to have such a long gap. But again, it's not in my hand. What really matters is that you work hard for a film and you come up with a good film. We are not giving our film a deadline. We just want it to make the best of its capabilities and release it."



Ranbir Kapoor is all set to work in Luv Ranjan's next film along with Deepika Padukone, Ajay Devgn and Tabu. The film was slated to release on Christmas in 2020 but then Aamir Khan announced the release date of his next film, Lal Singh Chaddha on the same date as well, which is an official Hindi remake of Tom Hanks blockbuster Forrest Gump.
