Batala, September 5

The medical staff at Civil Hospital, Batala, had a tough day dealing with autopsies of the dead and treatment of the injured. The doctors were busy conducting post-mortem examinations till late in the evening.

At least 14 patients are admitted to the hospital, while five are at Government Medical College, Amritsar. The hospital authorities had to cordon off three of their wards due to heavy rush of relatives and journalists.

DC Vipul Ujwal said, “The medical experts have advised for the same as victims of burn injuries are at higher risk of getting infected.”

The administration has managed to identify 21 of the 23 dead so far. However, high drama prevailed at the hospital as a family claimed that body of their kin, Satnam Singh, had gone missing from the mortuary.

The family claimed that they had come to the hospital after seeing Satnam’s picture in a vernacular. They accused the administration of trying to keep the death toll hidden.

The DC said, “We’ve recovered 23 bodies so far. We have shown all of these, including the two which remain unidentified, to the family but none of them belongs to the family.” He said they were trying to find how and from where the newspaper received the picture, which was published today. — TNS
