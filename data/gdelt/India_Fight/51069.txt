Two killed over stray cattle dispute

RAJKOT: The stray cattle menace on Amreli roads took an ugly turn after a 30-year-old man and his young nephew were brutally beaten to death, allegedly by those whose cattle one of the victims had helped captured. Police arrested five persons and booked 13 others for the crime.The police said Govind Makwana (30) and his nephew Kiran Makwana (27) were killed in Jivapara locality of Amreli on Sunday night.According to the police, the arrested accused, Sura Ratadia, Ramku Ratadia, Karsan Ratadia, Jaga Ratadia and Dharmendra Ratadia, were angry with Kiran as he had allegedly helped the cattle impounding squad of Amreli municipality to capture cattle belonging to them.“The accused had first circulated an audio clip, hurling abuses at Kiran on WhatsApp , following which Kiran filed an application of complaint against them. The seeds of discord were sown between the Ratadia and Makwana families as they fought several times over the issue in the past,” said an official from Amreli police station.“However, the members of both the families decided to strike a compromise and gathered at Somnath Mahadev temple in Jivapara, where after a heated exchange of arguments, they attacked each other with knives, bats and iron pipes,” added the official.Kiran was stabbed in his ribs, while Govind, who had tried to intervene, was also stabbed in his chest. While Kiran died in Rajkot Civil Hospital, Govind succumbed to injuries in Amreli Civil Hospital.Meanwhile, the Ratadia family also lodged a cross complaint against seven members of the Makwana family, accusing of assaulting them.Ever since the monsoon this year, Amreli has been plagued by the cattle menace with stray cattle occupying the stretch of Bus Stand Road, Lathi Road, Savarkundala Road, Liliya Road and Rajkamal Chowk Road.“In the monsoon, harassed by flies and boggy soil of the cattle sheds, cattle search for dry place to sit and rest, and hence they occupy the roads,” explained an official from Amreli municipality.
