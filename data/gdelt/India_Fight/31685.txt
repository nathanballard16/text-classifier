Relatives of four people killed in West Chester are asking the Indian government to get involved with the homicide investigation.In April, Hakiakat Singh Pannag, his wife Parmjit Kaur, their adult daughter, Shalinderjit Kaur and Parmjit's sister, Amarjit Kaur were shot a total of 18 times inside an apartment at the Lakefront at West Chester. All but one of the shots was to their heads."We want only justice. We are demanding the Indian government that they should talk to American government," said Jasdeep Singh, Amarjit Kaur's son. "It's been two months, and it's really a shock. We are in shock for last two months."Singh led a march for justice Sunday in Punjab, India. Hundreds of people, including many from the Sikh community attended.Singh also delivered a letter to the Indian government which said, "We request Indian government to take initiative to look into this critical matter and communicate with the USA government to solve this matter. We also demand to ensure the entry of suspect to India must be restricted by any means. Apart from this we demand that investigation should be commenced in India also. Moreover, we request Indian government to ensure the security of remaining members of the victims family as the killers are still on the run."Amarjit Kaur's other son, Garry Hans, came to Ohio after the shootings but has since left."If he can kill four members of my family, he can kill the rest," Hans said. "That's why I left Cincinnati because it's fear, like, he can kill like anybody."Hans referred to the shooter as a "he" but noted he doesn't know for sure that it's a man who killed his family.West Chester police have not named a suspect or commented on a motive.Sing and Hans said they believe investigators are on top of the investigation and believe in the American justice system, but they said they wish they had some answers."We don't want to wait for years and years. We need results very soon," Hans said.In a written statement, West Chester Township spokeswoman, Barb Wilson, said, "West Chester police investigators continue to follow countless leads and gather evidence aided by multiple agencies, the community and those who knew the victims. It is critical to the investigation that details and evidence be carefully guarded in order to preserve the integrity of the case, the identification of a potential suspect and future prosecution.Police Chief Joel Herzog wants everyone to know that the victims and their families, here and in India, are very much on the minds of officers as the investigation continues. This case will continue to be our top priority until those who committed this crime are held accountable.""I'm not going to give up until my last breath. No matter what it will take, we will keep fighting," Hans said.
