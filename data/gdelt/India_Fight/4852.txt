Congress Leader Promises To Repel Law Abolishing Triple Talaq If It Comes To Power; Praises Women Who Are Against It

Congress leader from Assam, Sushmita Dev has promised that the party would repeal the law abolishing Triple Talaq if it is voted to power, Hindustan Times has reported.

Dev was quoted by media reports as claiming that, The Congress party stood up and opposed it in Parliament. I am promising you when the Congress comes to power after the 2019 elections, we will abolish this triple talaq law”.

She made the statement while speaking at the national convention of All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) minority department on Thursday (7 February).

The Congress leader also praised the women who are opposed to this bill and lauded their signature campaigns to seek its withdrawal.

She claimed that the common perception stands that the bill’s purpose is to empower women. She thus justified her and her party’s opposition by alleging that via the bill the Narendra Modi government wants to put Muslim men in jail.

Following the Congress leader’s promise, the BJP has hit back by calling it minority appeasement. The party spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed that the Congress has no regard for the Supreme Court, which had struck down the Islamic instant divorce.
