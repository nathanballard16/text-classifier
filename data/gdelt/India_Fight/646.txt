Time to recreate Anna movement, says HS Phoolka

"The decision to covert the 2012 anti-corruption movement, led by Anna Hazare, into a political party was wrong," Phoolka said addressing reporters in New Delhi. "We should recreate a movement like the one created by Anna Hazare in 2012. The AAP was formed by Arvind Kejriwal and others following the anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare. A day after resigning from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), senior advocate HS Phoolka on Friday said there is a need to "recreate" a movement like the one started by anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in 2012. Those who have left AAP need to unite to form an organisation parallel to political parties," Phoolka said.
