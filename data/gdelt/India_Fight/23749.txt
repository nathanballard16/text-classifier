One held for illegal stay in Allahabad University hostel, using fake name

ALLAHABAD: A student of Allahabad University staying illegally in a hostel for eight years was arrested on Friday after a joint raid of police and varsity authorities.Om Narayan, an LLB student, had been living free of cost in Tara Chand hostel since 2011. Not only this, Narayan was staying under the alias of Rohit Patel. Until last year, he was not even enrolled in AU.According to AU chief proctor Ram Sevak Dubey, Narayan had passed intermediate in 2011 and BSc from Chitrakoot in 2014.“He was spotted on the campus regularly and had been living for eight years in a room of TC hostel. Last year, he was admitted in LLB in AU and legally allotted a room in GN Jha hostel,” said Prof Dubey.Narayan was suspended on Thursday and given 15 days to reply to why he should not be terminated from AU.“This person was involved in a number of violent activities, arson and damaging property. As he was known by the name of Rohit Patel, our notices and other disciplinary action proved futile,” said the chief proctor.His identity was revealed less than 10 days ago. On April 25, Narayan was caught for disturbing peace on the campus. In the VC’s office, when the dean asked his name, he said Om Narayan. Everyone was taken by surprise at the name.“Had it not been for this incident, he would have continued to befool us,” said the chief proctor.Narayan was also involved in the recent incident of violence where a large number of inmates of TC hostel had crashed a wedding and damaged property and thrashed people.“We have sent him to jail and added more sections of IPC in a case registered against him in 2017,” said inspector Colonelganj, Anoop Singh.
