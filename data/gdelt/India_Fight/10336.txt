Swiss Franc surges after Pakistan shot down two Indian jets in its airspace

Swiss Franc jumps notably on escalating tension between India and Pakistan. It’s reported that Pakistan said its fighter planes have shot down two Indian jets. Pakistan army spokesman Asif Ghafoor said Indian jets entered its airspace. Two Indian pilots are arrested.

Ghafoor said in a news conference “this was not a retaliation in true sense, but to tell Pakistan has capability, we can do it, but we want to be responsible, we don’t want an escalation, we don’t want a war.” The country’s foreign ministry also said in a statement “If India is striking at so called terrorist backers without a shred of evidence, we also retain reciprocal rights to retaliate against elements that enjoy Indian patronage while carrying out acts of terror in Pakistan,”

It come just a day after India claimed it attacked a terrorist camp in Pakistan. That’s the first time Indian jets struck inside Pakistan since 1971.
