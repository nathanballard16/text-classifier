The shooting of the Darshan-starrer Odeya has been wrapped up in Switzerland with the team shooting a song sequence in picturesque locations. The film has been shot in various locations including Mysuru, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

Directed by MD Sridhar, Odeya was earlier titled Wodeyar but the team eventually changed the title to Odeya to avoid controversies. The film is produced by Darshan’s close friend Sandesh Nagraj under the banner Sandesh Productions. Raghavi Thimmayya plays the female lead in this flick while Darshan plays a dual role. The movie was scheduled to release on November 1 to coincide with the Kannada Rajotsava Day but the release now stands postponed to December 20, as per sources.

Meanwhile, Darshan has wrapped up the shooting of his other film Robert and has also completed dubbing for the film. Tharun Sudhir is helming the project as its director and had remarked in one of the media interactions that he had written the movie as a Darshan fan and not as a director. This has assured the fans that the movie will completely satisfy Darshan’s fans. M Chandramouli (of KGF fame) and KL Rajshekar have written dialogues for Robert. When this film was announced, it was speculated that Darshan’s character in it is named Robert but the director later clarified that the character will have nothing to do with the star’s cameo role in Chowka. According to reports, the film will feature Vinod Prabhakar, son of actor Tiger Prabhakar, in an important role and the Tollywood actor Jagapathi Babu.

Also, Darshan is said to be in talks with Vakkantham Vamsi for a new project. Sources say that the director is in talks with Darshan and may soon foray into the Kannada film industry. However, this is yet to be confirmed.
