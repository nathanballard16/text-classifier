We won't spare the Pulwama attackers: PM Narendra Modi

Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that the neighbouring country has become a haven for terrorists. Addressing public meetings in Yavatmal and Dhule after inaugurating infrastructure projects, PM Modi reiterated that the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack will be punished. "Our security forces have been given a free hand in this regard," the PM said.

On the Pulwama carnage, the PM said, "Ours is a new India with new methods and policies. Those who spray bullets or those who provide guns and bombs to target our soldiers, will not be spared. We will not allow them to sleep in peace," PM Modi asserted.

Addressing public rallies, PM Modi said that security forces would decide as to when, where and how these perpetrators would be punished. Offering his condolences to the martyrs, Prime Minister said that he empathizes with the martyrs families.

The PM inaugurated various development projects in Maharashtra, and laid foundation stones of some projects during a programme for women's self-help groups at Pandharkavda and a public rally at Dhule.

He expressed faith in the valour of the security forces, saying he understood the seething anger of the CRPF soldiers, while appealing for faith in the forces. He mentioned that the perpetrators of Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF jawans could go into hiding for months. "But we will find them out and not spare them."

He reiterated that those who attacked the soldiers and those who provided them support will not be spared. "India will show the world how both its actions and policies have undergone a sea change," he said, adding that India never disturbs anyone but would not spare anyone who tries to disturb her peace.
