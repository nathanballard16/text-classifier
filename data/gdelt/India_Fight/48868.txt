Emerging water threat

Sir: Once again Indian PM Modi, addressing an election rally in Haryana, asserted that his government will stop water flowing to Pakistan and divert it to Haryana.

Earlier this year, India has threatened to stop water flow towards Pakistan after Pulwama attack. It is important to mention that under the Indus Ware Treaty (IWT) signed in 1960, the waters of the western rivers Indus, Jhelum and Chenab were given to Pakistan and those of the eastern rivers ie Ravi, Sutlej and Beas to India.

Such irresponsible statements reflected India’s aggressive designs and prove that it had no regard for human rights and international obligations. India has been cornered and isolated because of its atrocities and gross human rights violations in Indian-held Kashmir. Intentions of India have never been favorable for Pakistan and Indians always tried to exploit Pakistan’s vulnerabilities and tried to destruct its economy by various instruments and the water dispute was also a part of it. The India is rapidly moving towards its target of making Pakistan totally barren by building dams on three major rivers flowing into Pakistan from the Indian side of the border.
