CPI urges government to convene all party meeting to discuss draft edu policy

The Communist Party of India (CPI) has urged the Tamil Nadu government to convene an all party meeting to discuss and debate the various aspects of the draft New Education Policy 2019 released recently.

“There seems to be efforts to take education under the complete control of the central government and this will encroach on the rights of the state,” a statement from R. Mutharasan, State Secretary of the party on behalf of the party’s State Council said.

The party further alleged that the Central government led by the BJP was attempting to saffronise the education system and pose a threat to the diversity of the country through the draft policy. They further said that Tamil Nadu government under Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has not reacted to the draft policy yet and the reason remains unknown.

“We need to listen to the feedback of the people and come together for an all party meeting at the earliest, where we can bring together our views on the policy and send it to the central government,” the statement said.

The party has further urged the Central government to release the draft policy in all regional languages so that it is more accessible. “Only then can all the states put forth their constructive feedback. The centre should also extend the deadline for the public to send in feedback ,” the party said.
