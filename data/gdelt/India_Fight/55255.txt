S&P Flags India Growth Risks in Debt Downgrade Warning

New Delhi: S&P Global Ratings has warned that India’s debt may be downgraded in the event of a major economic slowdown.

After the agency’s report, sovereign bonds slid, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year-note rising 5 basis points to 6.76%.

The rating company added that it expects the Indian economy to only gradually recover over the next few years with correspondingly higher growth.

”If this recovery does not materialise, and it becomes clear that India’s structural growth has significantly deteriorated, we could lower the rating,” Andrew Wood, a Singapore-based analyst at S&P, said in a statement.

S&P currently rates India at ‘BBB-’, which is one of the lowest investment-grade ratings.

Another rating agency, Moody’s Investors Service, lowered India’s outlook to negative from stable in November though it still rates the country a little higher than S&P.

India has been battling an economic growth slowdown for the last six quarters. In Q2, the economy expanded at 4.5%, the lowest since 2013, as a fall in domestic consumption and weak credit growth took their toll.

After the Q2 results, at least two institutions have lowered their FY’20 growth forecast for India. The Asian Development Bank this week revised it downward to 5.1% from the previous forecast of 6.5%.

The Reserve Bank of India, in its recent monetary policy committee press conference, believes that India will grow only at 5% this fiscal, down from its earlier estimate of 6.1%.
