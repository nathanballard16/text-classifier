TPCC accuses K Chandrasekhar Rao of murdering state’s democracy

Hyderabad: TPCC treasurer and Congress MLC candidate Gudur Narayana Reddy on Tuesday accused the Telangana state Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of murdering the democracy in the state.

Speaking to mediapersons at the Gandhi Bhavan, he said that he would have got elected as an MLC had Mr Rao not encouraged defections from the Congress.

He alleged that the CM has lured some Congress MLAs for their defection to the TRS.

He said that despite having the required numbers, the Congress couldn’t win the seat due to multiple defections.

He said that they were forced to boycott the MLC elections which consequently resulted in the TRS-MIM win in all the five seats. He also accused the CM of practicing unethical and ugly politics in TS and smothering democracy in the state.
