Actor Sanjay Dutt's biggest pillars of strength have been his parents and on his mother's 90th birth anniversary on Saturday, the actor took to Instagram to share a memorable picture from his childhood.

Taking to Instagram, the Munna Bhai star shared a black and white photo of his mother and sister Priya Dutt.

Sanjay Dutt captioned it, "Memories never fade! Happy Birthday Mom." His wife Maanayata Dutt also commented on the picture with three hearts.
