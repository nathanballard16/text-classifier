LUCKNOW: Police on Thursday claimed to have cracked the sensational loot and murder case at Durgapuri Metro station in Alambagh on June 30 in which two traders were robbed of Rs 2 lakh and one of them was shot from point blank range.

Police said the accused, Raj Kumar aka Raju Kashyap of Pan Dariba, was well acquainted with the victim, Manoj Bhattacharya (45).

Additional superintendent of police (east) Suresh Chand Rawat said Raj Kumar was arrested in Mawaiyya around 3.45am on Thursday.

He said cops recovered a country-made pistol, Rs 1.7 lakh cash and the motorcycle which was used by Raj Kumar and his three aides to commit the crime.

“Raj Kumar has confessed to the crime. He disclosed that he executed the murder with the help of his nephew Vishal, gang leader Shailesh Dwivedi aka Praveen and Moin-uz-Jafar aka Manu,” the ASP said.

Rawat said Raj Kumar came to know that Kapil Bajaj aka Ashu (48), a Delhi-based trader and a friend of Manoj, used to come to Lucknow to collect payments from traders in Naka and then return to Delhi.

Raju passed on this information to Shailesh who chalked out a plan. They started following Manoj and Kapil on June 30 night when they left for Charbagh railway station.

“They hit Manoj’s twowheeler and then tried to loot the bag which Kapil was holding. In the scuffle, mask fell off from Raj Kumar’s face and Manoj identified him. At this, Raj Kumar incited Shailesh to shoot the duo,” Rawat said.

They were rushed to KGMU trauma centre where Manoj was pronounced dead on arrival.
