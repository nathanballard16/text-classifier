A 38-year-old man was murdered early Tuesday morning at his home in Mumbai's Antop Hill. The murder took place between 2am and 3am Tuesday. A few men are believed to have barged into the man's seventh floor home in the Penta Galaxy building and slit his throat while he was sleeping.

Neighbours heard the man's cries and alerted the police. The man was barely alive when cops came in and was taken to the Sion hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival.

The man has been identified as 38-year-old journalist Anand Narayan. He used to work for a local newspaper in Mumbai.

According to news agency PTI, the alleged murder took place around 2.30 am when Anand Narayan was alone at his seventh floor home in Antop Hill's Penta Galaxy Cooperative Housing Society. Neighbours were alerted when they heard Narayan's cries for help.

The neighbours then called the police. Narayan was found lying in a pool of blood, following which he was rushed to the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, locally known as Sion hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.

The Mumbai Police has registered a case of murder. An unnamed police officer told PTI that they had recovered CCTV footage showing three unidentified people entering Anand Narayan's building at around 2am. The three are suspects in the murder.

Antop Hill police station senior inspector Rajiv Whaval confirmed that a murder case had been registered.
