5 killed in road accident

Coimbatore: Four labourers from West Bengal and a Keralite were killed after a head-on collision between a truck and a car on the Salem – Kochi Highway near Vellalore Pirivu on early Saturday morning.

The deceased were identified as M Mohamed Basheer, 44, of Vallapuzha in Palakkad, B Hiralal Sikari, 28, from South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal, G Gouranga Pandit, 30, his younger brother G Mithun Pandit, 27 and Lalita Mondal, 31, wife of Puranchandaramondal from South 24 Parganas.

Basheer, a building contractor, was driving the car, police sources said. “The migrant labourers were working under him. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Basheer and the labourers had offered prayers in a temple in Kerala and were heading towards a construction site in Salem. When the car reached Vellalore Pirivu, Basheer dozed off and lost control over the vehicle. It collided head on with a mini truck carrying paper bundles coming from the opposite direction. Two people died on the spot and two were rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). A migrant labourer was admitted in a private hospital. But the doctors could not save them,” a police officer said.

The bodies are kept in the CMCH mortuary.

Basheer’s body was handed over to his family after postmortem. The Sulur police informed the families of the migrant labourers. They are expected to reach Coimbatore on Sunday.

Police have booked truck Sathish Kumar, 25, a native of Trichy.
