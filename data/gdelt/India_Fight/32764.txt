BJP’s Ravi Kishan sings to demand inclusion of Bhojpuri in Eighth Schedule

Ravi Kishan also pointed out that the language was spoken in Mauritius and in Caribbean countries, and recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had greeted people in Bihar and Varanasi in the Bhojpuri language.

BJP member and Bhojpuri movie star Ravi Kishan on Monday broke into a Bhojpuri song in the Lok Sabha to make a case for the inclusion of Bhojpuri in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Kishan said the language was spoken by over 25 crore people in the country. He also pointed out that the language was spoken in Mauritius and in Caribbean countries, and recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had greeted people in Bihar and Varanasi in the Bhojpuri language.

As the Gorakhpur MP started singing, Speaker Om Birla immediately interrupted him and asked him to sing later. To this, the actor said that through the song, he wanted to show the “sweetness” of the language. Many members were seen backing Kishan’s demand.

The Eighth Schedule to the Constitution includes 22 languages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Bodo, Santali, Maithili, and Dogri.

Reports of unemployment rate misleading, says govt
