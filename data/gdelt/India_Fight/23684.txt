INS Vela, Indian Navy’s Fourth Scorpene Submarine, All Set to Touch Waters on 6 May

India’s Scorpene Submarine programme is all set to roll out its fourth unit, named INS Vela on 6 May, reports The Week.

Under construction at the Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) Mumbai, INS Vela has completed its out fittings and is going to officially touch waters on 6 May.

To improve its under water capabilities, India signed a contract with France to build six submarines in 2006. The French firm DCNS and Mazgaon Dock Limited are into the joint venture under an ambitious, $3 billion Project-75.

Starting from INS Kalvari in 2017, two other submarines - INS Khanderi and INS Karanj, are already in advanced stages of getting commissioned into the Naval fleet. With the rolling out of the fourth in the series, INS Vela, the last two -- INS Vagir and INS Vagsheer, which are in the advanced in the advanced stages of manufacturing -- are remaining.

The Scorpene class submarine project will incite a big leap towards India's self reliance in the defence sector under the "Make in India'' initiative.
