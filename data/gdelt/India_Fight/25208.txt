I am saying this publicly and I also said the same to him over phone. Pitroda ji, what you had said was completely wrong and you should be ashamed of yourself. You should seek public apology," he said winding up his speech here.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh was also present at the event.Speaking to reporters last week, Pitroda had brushed off the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by saying, "hua toh hua" (whatever happened, happened).This is the second time that the Congress chief has rebuked Pitroda for his remarks on the 1984 riots.The Congress chief had earlier tweeted his disapproval and the party had distanced himself from Pitroda's remarks.Demanding an apology from Pitroda, Rahul had said that his statements were “completely out of line”.The BJP has stepped up offensive against the Congress over the Indian Overseas Congress chief's remarks as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots is an emotive issue in Punjab which is going to polls on May 19.During campaigning in Rohtak in Haryana and at Hoshiarpur in Punjab, Modi on Friday had hit out at the Congress, saying Pitroda's remarks reflected the "character and arrogance" of the opposition party.On Sunday in Amritsar, BJP chief Amit Shah had asked Rahul Gandhi whether the matter has ended with Pitroda tendering an apology for "justifying" the Sikh genocide.
