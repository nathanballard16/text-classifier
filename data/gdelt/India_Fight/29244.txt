West Bengal: Fresh violence between TMC-BJP, 3 dead

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Expressing the Centre’s “deep concern” at the raging post-poll violence in Bengal, the home ministry on Sunday issued an advisory to the Mamata Banerjee government, asking it to take necessary measures to maintain law and order as well as strict action against officials found delinquent in discharge of their duty.This came a day before Bengal governor Kesari Nath Tripathi is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi where he is expected to submit a report on the state’s cycle of violence. “Governor Tripathi is very sad at the unfortunate loss of life and property of citizens. He extends his heartfelt sympathy for the families and near and dear ones of the deceased. He appeals to all concerned so that no violent incidents take place and peace and harmony prevail in the state,” a release from the governor’s office in Kolkata said.“The unabated violence over the past weeks appears to be a failure on the part of the law enforcement machinery of the state to maintain the rule of law and inspire confidence among people. It is strongly advised to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to maintain law and order and peace. It is also requested to take strict action against officials found delinquent in discharge of their duty,” the advisory said.After the BJP’s impressive show — winning 18 of the 42 seats in the state and trouncing Trinamool in its strongholds — in the Lok Sabha elections, the state has been witnessing clashes between the two parties. The state goes to polls in 2021.
