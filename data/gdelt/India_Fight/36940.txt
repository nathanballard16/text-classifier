Raebareli accident: CBI registers case against Kuldeep Singh Sengar, nine others

New Delhi [India], July 31 (ANI): The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday registered a case against Unnao rape accused and suspended BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, his brother Manoj Singh Sengar and eight others in connection with the rape survivor's accident case.

The investigating agency also filed charges of criminal conspiracy, murder, attempt to murder and criminal intimidation against 20 unknown people.

The case was handed over to the CBI yesterday after a formal request was made by the Uttar Pradesh government to the Centre for a probe by the agency.

The UP Police had earlier filed a case involving murder and other charges against the legislator and nine others in connection with the accident.

The accident took place on July 28 when the Unnao rape victim was on her way to Raebareli.

A truck rammed into the vehicle in which she was travelling with her two aunts and a lawyer. While she and her lawyer sustained grievous injuries, her aunts were killed.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a legislator from Bangermau in Unnao district, is the prime accused in the case. He is currently lodged in Sitapur district jail.

The teenager was allegedly raped by the MLA at his residence in Unnao on June 4, 2017, where she had gone to seek a job. (ANI)
