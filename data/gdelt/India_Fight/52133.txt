Shah Rukh Khan’s gesture for an acid attack survivor is adorable

Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan has been ruling our hearts for more than three decades now. The actor not just has a massive fan following in India but all over the world. Interestingly, what makes him a lot more special is the love he sends out to his fans time and again. Winning the internet yet again with his sweet gesture, this time King Khan did something special for an acid attack survivor. For the unversed, the actor is the founder of Meer Foundation, an organisation supporting acid attack victims.

It all happened when SRK took to his social media handle to congratulate one of the acid attack victims associated with his organisation as she tied the knot. The 54-year-old actor wrote, “Congratulations and my love to Anupama as she starts on this new journey of life. May it be filled with love light and laughter. U r the man Jagdeep...and may u both have double the reasons to be happy with this union.

Along with this he even shared some pictures with the lovely lady. Take a look.
