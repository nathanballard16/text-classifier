India imposes curfews in Kashmir after clashes

Curfew-like restrictions were reimposed on Sunday in several parts of Kashmir, including the city, to foil any plans of taking out Muharram processions in the Valley as authorities apprehended that large congregations might lead to violence.



Commercial hub of Lal Chowk and adjoining areas were completely sealed off by placing concertina wires at all entry points where large number of security force personnel were deployed, officials said.



Restrictions have been in several parts of Kashmir as a precautionary measure for maintaining law and and order in the Valley, they said.
