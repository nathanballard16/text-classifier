J&K: 3 Pakistani Soldiers Dead As Indian Army Responds To Ceasefire Violation Along LoC In Poonch

In a tweet, Ghafoor also alleged that the Indian Army has increased firing along the LoC in an effort to divert attention from the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

Pakistan on Thursday violated the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir’s Nowgam and Krishna Ghati sector, prompting Indian Army to retaliate. Three Pakistani soldiers have been killed by Indian Army while responding to the unprovoked firing by Pakistan. Army denied Pakistan's claim of 5 Indian soldiers being killed in ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. The response by the Indian Army came after Pakistan military's spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor claimed that three of its soldiers and five Indian personnel were killed in the cross-border firing.
