Banking operations partially affected

Banking operations have been affected in some parts of the country as a section of employees refrained from work in support of the strike.

All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees' Federation of India (BEFI) have supported the strike, which has impacted banking operation where these two unions are strong.

However, operation at SBI and private sector banks remained unaffected as other seven unions in the banking sector are not part of the strike. Many public sector banks have already informed their customers about likely impact on services if strike materialises. (PTI)
