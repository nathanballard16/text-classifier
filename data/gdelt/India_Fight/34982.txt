Samajwadi Party leader Ateeq Ahmed in Gujarat jail, CBI raids his Uttar Pradesh home

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) carried out raids on residences of former Samajwadi Party parliamentarian Ateeq Ahmed, who is currently in jail, and his associates on Wednesday in a kidnapping case of a businessman.

The agency said, "We are conducting raids at six places including Lucknow and Allahabad at the premises of Ateeq Ahmed and others in an ongoing investigation of a case related to alleged incident of abduction and assaulting of a businessman."

A case was registered against Ahmed and 17 others by the CBI in June on charges of abduction and assault of Mohit Jaiswal, a real estate dealer, who was allegedly then forced to transfer his business to Ahmed and other accused.

The FIR was filed on directions of the Supreme Court against Ahmed for kidnapping a businessman and then bringing him to the prison where he was lodged. The SC had directed quick disposal of over 100 cases registered against him and shifted him to a prison outside UP in Gujarat.

According to the allegations, Jaiswal was abducted in December 2018 from Lucknow and was taken to Prayagraj's Naini Central Jail where Ahmed was lodged. He was then allegedly assaulted by Ahmed and his aides.

The CBI raided official and residential premises of Ahmed and his son Umar Mohammad, residence of Zaki Ahmed and premises of Mohammed Farrukh (both Ateeq's associates). Two places in Lucknow belonging to Nitesh Mishra, a CA and Pawan Kumar Singh, a staff of Ahmed were searched.

Four firms belonging to complainant Manoj Jaiswal - MJ Infra Housing Pvt Ltd, MJ Infra Green Pvt Ltd, MJ Infra Estate Pvt Ltd, MJ Infra Land Limited - were forcefully transferred to the associates of Ahmed, the CBI alleged.
