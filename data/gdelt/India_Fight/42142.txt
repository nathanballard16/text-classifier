Mishap at ONGC unit in Navi Mumbai kills 4

MUMBAI: A major fire broke out at Oil & Natural Gas Corp’s gas processing unit in Navi Mumbai ’s Uran area, killing four people and fuelling concerns over the safety of such units.This was the second major incident forthis year. An oil well at Nandej near Ahmedabad caught fire on March 13, claiming the lives of two contract workers.“We are extremely sad to have lost four precious lives – three CISF jawans and a senior ONGC officer – in the unfortunate fire incident in Uran plant today in spite of valiant efforts made to contain the blaze in less than two hours,” ONGC said on Tuesday.Three CISF fire wing personnel were killed during the fire-fighting operations when an explosion took place in the pipeline, the Central Industrial Security Force said in a Twitter post.ONGC shares fell 3.3% to ?117.15 at the close on the BSE on Tuesday, while the benchmark Sensex index dropped more than 2%.The fire broke out in the stormwater drainage at the Uran plant early in the morning and was successfully doused within two hours, ONGC said. Steps had been taken to maintain the full quantity of gas supplies to Mahanagar Gas Ltd so that the people of Mumbai are not affected, India’s biggest oil exploration company said in a Twitter post.The oil and gas industry deals in highly inflammable hydrocarbons, using high temperatures and pressure in its processes, and accords high importance to the safety of vital plants, installations, employees and the public. Still, accidents have occurred in the sector, causing damage to property and loss of lives.A total number of 309 accidents took place during 2014-17, including upstream and downstream oil companies, in which 81people died and 193 were injured, according to government data.While there have been fewer accidents at some public sector units, the numbers are still high for ONGC and Hindustan Petroleum Corp., which is alarming, a standing committee on petroleum and natural gas chaired by Prahlad Joshi, had said in a report on ‘Safety, Security and Environmental Aspects in Petroleum Sector’ on July 25, 2018. Since then, more accidents have been reported such as the fires at Indian Oil Corp’s Panipat refinery in March and HPCL’s Vizag unit in April.“It is distressing if even a single life is lost. Most oil and gas companies follow international operating standards, but if still there are accidents, then it will do them well to review the process,” said Anil Razdan, former additional and special secretary in the petroleum ministry.
