Legislature reaches bill crossover stage with budget negotiations under way

However, a federal law banning the act was struck down in November by a federal court in Michigan, which said states should decide what they want to permit.

Krawiec said she filed the bill “because we must protect our girls from this abuse of being mutilated ... and this barbaric procedure.”

“When this issue has been brought up, most people can’t believe it’s not already illegal to do this in North Carolina,” she said.

When asked about the prevalence of female genital mutilation in North Carolina, or what counties are affected in particular, Krawiec has said she is not aware of any specific data for the state.

“We just want to make sure it never happens in North Carolina,” she said.

The bill, if passed into law, would make it a Class C felony — with a 44- to 182-month prison sentence — for someone who performs the procedure in North Carolina and for a parent, guardian or another person who consents to the procedure.
