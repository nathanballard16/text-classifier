Gandhi scion has publically announced his resignation as Congress president recently taking the moral responsibility of poll defeat.

The former lawmaker from Amethi lost the Nehru-Gandhi bastion to BJP leader Smriti Irani in the 17th Lok Sabha elections.

It was the seat from where his parents, Sonia and Rajiv Gandhi, had contested and won.

Amethi in Uttar Pradesh was a prestige battle in the recent Lok Sabha elections, which Irani won with a heavy margin, defeating Gandhi, who held the seat for the past 15 years.

The Gandhi scion, Member of Lok Sabha from Wayanad in Kerala, became the Congress president in 2017. He offered to step down from his post at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on May 25, taking moral responsibility for the Congress' abysmal performance in the 17th Lok Sabha Elections.

Last week, he had put a letter on Twitter making his resignation public and empowering the CWC to choose his successor. (ANI)
