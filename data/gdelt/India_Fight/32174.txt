Sonia, Rahul Gandhi Should Apologise For 'Injustice' Done To P V Narasimha Rao: Grandson

"It is very clear and evident that his dead body was not even allowed to enter the headquarters of AICC in Delhi", Subhash told PTI.

HYDERABAD: Grandson of P V Narasimha Rao on Thursday hit back at a senior Congress leader for his allegations against the former Prime Minister and sought an apology from the Gandhi family for "injustice" done to him. N V Subhash said AICC Secretary G Chinna Reddy's statement that Rao had tried to "sideline" the Nehru-Gandhi family during his tenure was "not true and condemnable". "Rao was the most trusted and loyal leader for Gandhi family and always guided the family on many issues", he claimed. Subhash joined the BJP in 2014 and is one of the official spokespersons of the Telangana unit of the party. He alleged that the Congresss always neglected the leaders other than those from the Nehru-Gandhi family, especially late P V Narasimha Rao.
