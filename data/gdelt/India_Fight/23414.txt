Hoardings at the interaction of SV Road and Link Road junction in Bandra West

Traffic cops want implementation of 25-m junction-to-hoarding distance rule to avoid distraction to motorists; willing to bend on 50 m norm; owners want distance to be fixed from approach road.Ninety-sevenat popular traffic signals are on the authorities’ radar for being a ‘distraction’ to motorists. The traffic police have initiated action against them for violating a rule of the, a body under the ministry of road transport and highways, that mandates a distance of 50 m from the nearest traffic light for hoardings.The hoardings are at, SV Road-Link Road intersection (Bandra), Pedder Road, Mahalaxmi, Poddar (Worli), Kalanagar, Kherwadi, Vakola, Centaur (Vile Parle), Cadbury (near Heera Panna, Haji Ali), Bahar (Andheri East), Mahim Causeway, JJ Marg, Chakala and Nesbit Road (Byculla) junctions.Amitesh Kumar, joint commissioner of police,, said proceedings were initiated following a survey. “We found 97 hoardings being a distraction for motorists at traffic signals.” Kumar has been summoning hoarding owners and explaining the law to them.The traffic police are willing to meet them halfway—they want them to follow the 25-m distance rule spelled out under Section 16D of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act. “Although the Indian Roads Congress demands a 50-m distance, we are pressing for only 25 m,” said a traffic police official.To persuade hoarding owners to toe the line, they have withdrawn the illumination no-objection certificate (which it is responsible for) of 50 of these structures, and will soon write to the BMC recommending civic action as well.Hoarding owners, however, want the rules bent some more. They have asked that the 25-m rule be applicable from the approach road, and not the traffic junction. Four persons were killed when an illegal hoarding in Pune fell on an autorickshaw in October last year.
