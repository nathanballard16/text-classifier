Indian Opposition Leader in Hot Water for Sexist Remark Against Female Minister

Clashing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Rafale deal has put opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in a tight spot with the apex statutory body for women's rights, who issued a notice to him on Thursday over an allegedly sexist remark he made in a recent tweet. The body has asked Gandhi, president of the Congress Party, to come up with an explanation for his remarks and issue an apology.

"We have asked for an explanation from Rahul Gandhi for why he said and what he said on Wednesday in two his tweets. The statement was pathetic, sexist and misogynistic. That is why we have sent him a notice," NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said.
