Ludhiana man denied bail in Sector 7 firing case

CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district court has denied bail to a 27-year-old Ludhiana man accused of firing at a bouncer in Sector 7 on February 10.After hearing Amandeep’s bail application, the court observed, “As the case investigation is on and other accused are yet to be arrested, the release of the applicant on bail is likely to hamper free and fair probe. Hence, the bail application is dismissed.”On February 11, the complainant — Gurdeep Singh, a bouncer at a Sector 7 microbrewery pub, Chandigarh — had told the police, “I was near the pub around 7.45pm when three men — Baldev, Amandeep and their associate — came to me and asked me what I was doing there. After they left, my friend, Anil, came to pick me up.”The two were on way to the pub when the three men intercepted their bike. “Armed with sticks, the trio started assaulting us. Soon, they were joined by six to seven of their aides, who too carried sticks. Then, one of them — Baldev — them took out a pistol and fired at me. I ducked and the bullet missed its mark. As the gunshot drew the attention of passersby, Baldev fired in the air before making good his escape with his accomplices,” the FIR added.The defence counsel said Amandeep did not fire any shots and was therefore entitled to bail.The public prosecutor argued as Amandeep accompanied Baldev and was part of the incident, his involvement was as serious as that of the main accused.Following the arguments, the court dismissed Amandeep’s bail application.
