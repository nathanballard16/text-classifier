Feminist writer and professor of English Germaine Greer said on Thursday ‘Nirbhaya’ was a victim of “brutal murder”, not merely “rape”. Speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival , where she spoke of her views on rape and the #Metoo movement, among other things, Greer said Nirbhaya was remembered everyday in India as a victim of rape.“Rape was the least of it.
