Has Kashmir Militancy Declined After PDP and BJP Break-Up?

“It was like a completely liberated zone. Crowds of the size of 40,000 to 60,000 would gather in rotation at different villages, wave Pakistani flags, and shout for ‘Azadi’ and Pakistan. Same flags were installed at government colleges and other offices. There were broad daylight militant parades, and public speeches. Police or security forces would not venture into the villages, fearing stone-pelting and terror attacks. They enjoyed a field day from July 2016 till the day Mehbooba Mufti was forced to step down as CM in June 2018,” said a senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer, on condition of anonymity.

“It was for the first time since 1989 that the civilian demonstrators, armed with stones, and the guerrillas equipped with automatic rifles, joined hands to take on the government and the police and paramilitary forces. But in the last, say two years, particularly from June 2018 to July 2019, we have introduced a host of tools: surgical operations against terrorists; establishment of dozens of fresh security forces camps and passage barriers; incremental liaison with the civilian populations; arrests and detentions of top separatist leaders and ideologues and deterrence the ground mobilisers; end to the release of potential saboteurs and over ground workers (OGWs) in exchange for bribes,” added the senior police officer.
