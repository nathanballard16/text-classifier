The superstar who is known for his social work through his Being Human foundation has taken the responsibility of his Dabangg 3 co-star’s treatment, Daddi Pandey. As per reports, Salman Khan’s Dabangg 3 co-star Daddi Pandey suffered a heart attack recently. The incident didn’t take place on the sets of the film, but still, the superstar went out of his way to keep a tab on his co-actor’s health, when he was told about it.
