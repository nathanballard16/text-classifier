Ex-serviceman killed as PRTC bus hits bike

Ludhiana: An ex-serviceman was killed after a PEPSU Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) bus rear-ended his motorcycle on Elevated Road on Tuesday.

Jaspal Singh, 65, a resident of New Subhash Nagar in Basti Jodhewal, had retired as a sepoy from Army.

Division 1 police station SHO inspector Rajwant Singh said, “Jaspal had gone to pension office near Jagraon bridge. Around 12.30pm, he was on way home when a speeding PRTC bus hit his motorcycle from the rear. Traffic cops deployed near the spot, along with passersby, took Jaspal to civil hospital, where he was declared brought dead.”

Following the crash, the bus driver fled, leaving the vehicle behind.

Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “Heavy vehicles are not allowed on Elevated Road, which runs from Jagraon bridge to Chand Cinema, from 9am to 10pm. But as there was a huge traffic jam at Dholewal flyover due to flyover construction work near Basti Jodhewal, vehicles were diverted and buses allowed to ply Elevated Road.”

The bus driver has been booked under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.
