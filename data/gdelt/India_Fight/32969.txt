Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday summoned Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik over the Chandni Chowk temple vandalisation incident.

According to sources, Amit Shah reprimanded the Delhi Police over the delay in action in the case.

The clashes broke out between two groups in Old Delhi's Hauz Qazi area after a temple was vandalised on Sunday night.

"I have briefed him about the situation here," Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik said after meeting the home minister.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police arrested another person in connection with the incident on Wednesday. Earlier, two persons were arrested along with a minor on Tuesday for allegedly vandalising the temple.

"Things are now normal in the Hauz Qazi area. Four people have been arrested," Amulya Patnaik said.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Congress targeted the central government over "no action" in Delhi "temple incident". Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi took to Twitter to question why no action has been taken by Amit Shah in the temple vandalisation case yet.

A temple was vandalised over a parking lot scuffle between two men that also led to a communal clash in the area.

Questioning the BJP, Abhishek Singhvi said, "Day 2 of the temple incident and no action yet by Home Minister, Delhi Police under the BJP rules Centre. We know the ruling party doesn't care about minorities but does it also not care for the sentiments of majority?"
