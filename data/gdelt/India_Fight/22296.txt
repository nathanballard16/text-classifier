End the Slaughter of Rare Antelopes for Luxury Scarves

Target: Che Dalha, Chairman, Tibet Autonomous Region

Goal: Protect Tibetan antelope from brutal slaughter for their hide.

The Tibetan antelope, one of the most majestic and rare antelopes to exist in the wild, is being brutally slaughtered and stripped of its hide so that the soft felt can be made into luxurious scarves, or shahtoosh, that sell for as much as $20,000 on the black market. Demand that this cruelty come to an end.

The Tibetan antelope that has lost over 90 percent of its population in the 1990s alone. Only about 75,000 remain in their natural habitat. The rest have been murdered and turned into expensive accessories. Over 800 scarves made of their hide were seized in Western Europe between 2015 and 2018 alone. Four antelopes must die to make one scarf.

The trade of shahtoosh is illegal, yet such scarves still find their way out of Tibet, out of India, and into Western nations. The problem must end where it begins. Demand that the government of Tibet protect this majestic animal and hold those responsible for harming it to the strictest of punishments.

PETITION LETTER:

Dear Chairman Dalha,

There used to be over a million Tibetan antelope in your nation. Now there are fewer than 75,000. The majestic species is brutally slaughtered, four individuals being used to make one scarf sold for as much as $20,000. Their trade has become an epidemic that must be stopped.

The issue is starting in your nation. As such, you have a duty to protect the antelope. End their domestication, end their brutal slaughter, and end their trade. They belong in the wild, not around the neck of a millionaire.

Sincerely,

[Your Name Here]
