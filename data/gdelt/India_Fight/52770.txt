Ensure defence personnel are treated well, Rajnath to UP CM

New Delhi, Nov 27 : Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to ensure that defence personnel are treated well with dignity in all the administrative offices, sources said on Wednesday.

On incidents of defence personnel and paramilitary forces being harassed at government's administrative offices, Singh told Adityanath: "I request you that if these personnel or their family members visit any administrative office, kindly treat them with respect and dignity." Singh pointed out that these personnel are staying far from their homes and are posted at sensitive places near borders in tough conditions only to safeguard India.

"I also request you to ensure that their works are done with immediate effect." The minister said all three services personnel, paramilitary jawans and their family members and retired personnel should be treated well.

He also asked Adityanath to issue directions to all state government officers to ensure compliance.

Last month, policeman attacked a retired Army officer after a heated argument inside a police station in Uttar Pradesh's Mau district, prompting the district police to launch a probe into the matter.

The incident took place at the Sarahu police post where the Army veteran had gone to get an impounded motorcycle back, but an argument broke out between him and the chowki in-charge.

A video of the incident surfaced on social media, in which the policeman threatens the officer of hitting him with shoes and then slaps him.
