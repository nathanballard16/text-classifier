Salman Khan, Sonakshi Sinha to begin Dabangg 3 shoot in April

The third iteration of the action-comedy franchise, Dabangg, is all set to go on floors with the lead actors Salman Khan and Sonakshi Sinha getting back together for the film. Dabangg 3 will be about how Salman’s character Chulbul Pandey turned into the person that he is.

A Mumbai Mirror report quoted Dabangg producer Arbaaz Khan as saying, “We start shooting in the first week of April in Maheshwar and later move to Wai and Mumbai.” Arbaaz had turned director with Dabangg 2 and Prabhudeva will direct the third part.
