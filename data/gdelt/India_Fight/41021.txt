SFI alleges its activists attacked by ABVP members in Delhi

Students' Federation of India (SFI) on Monday alleged its activists were attacked by ABVP members while they were sticking posters in north Delhi's Vijay Nagar.

The RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad denied SFI's allegations. Police said a case has been registered in the matter.

SFI claimed its activists were sticking posters in Vijay Nagar area around 1.30 am on Monday when a group of 10 ABVP men armed with sticks bearing iron nails attacked its activists.

Sumit, the vice president of the SFI, was gravely injured, they said.

"He was hit on the head with a blunt object and he lost consciousness. Women activists also were not spared. Lewd comments were passed outraging their modesty," the SFI claimed.

While leaving, ABVP members threatened the activists to withdraw the complaint of sexual harassment filed by one of the women activists against ABVP leaders in February this year, it said.

The party said CCTV cameras must be checked to identify the cars they arrived in and demanded that the culprits be nabbed immediately.

A functionary of the ABVP rubbished the allegations.

"The SFI levels such allegations before every election. We believe in democratic processes and allow everyone to campaign. They do not have any evidence. No one from our party was involved," he said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest) Vijayanta Arya confirmed an FIR had been registered in the matter and the SFI has named one of the alleged attackers. Further investigation is underway, she said.
