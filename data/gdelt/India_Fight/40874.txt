Bengaluru: Cabbie kills model, texts husband from her phone demanding Rs 5 lakh

A 22-year-old cab driver was arrested by Bengaluru police in an alleged murder case.



Nagesh, the driver, was arrested on August 21 for allegedly killing a Kolkata-based model while dropping her off to the airport.



The incident took place on July 31 near the Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru.



The 32-year-old model-cum-event manager was identified as Pooja Singh De.



The cab driver, on their way to the airport, drove to an isolated place and robbed Pooja.



The accused then committed the crime by hitting Pooja on her head, which left her dead on the spot.



After killing her, Nagesh took all the belongings -- mobile phone and cash.



This does not end here. Not gratified by the belongings, the accused then texted Pooja's husband and demanded Rs 5 lakh from him.



The victim was stabbed multiple times and had head injuries, police said.



The victim had come to Bengaluru for an event on July 30 and was returning to West Bengal when she was murdered, added police.



The incident came to light after Pooja's husband filed a police complaint in Kolkata and later got in touch with the Bengaluru police.



Pooja's body was found by local villagers near the airport compound and informed the police.



Initially, police struggled but cracked the case based on her Titan watch, 'Jealous 21' jeans and a pair of branded sandals that she wore.
