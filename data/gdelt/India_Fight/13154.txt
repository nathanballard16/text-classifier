Chennai: Words like ‘bomb’, ‘explosion’, ‘attack’ could lead you in serious trouble these days, especially in the Indian subcontinent. With cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan at such a high magnitude following the Pulwama terror attack and IAF airstrikes last month, the whole country, especially north India, is on high alert and any suspicious conversation could lead to serious consequences.

A passenger on an IndiGo domestic flight on Tuesday uttered the word ‘bomb’ in front of the airline staff in protest of the tightened security and was immediately offloaded from the flight.

“Am I carrying a bomb in my bag?” Alex Mathew, from Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district, reportedly told the staff at Chennai Airport, news agency ANI reported.

The carrier confirmed that the incident took place around 7:30 pm yesterday when the ‘Secondary Ladder Point Security’ (SLPC) was being carried out for the 6E-582 Cochin-Bhubaneswar IndiGo flight.

As soon as the incident took place, a Quick Response Team, Dog Squad and Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad arrived at the spot and inspected his luggage. Nothing suspicious was found on him. Mathew was then offloaded and handed over to the local police for further action.

An SLPC is a final round of checking on passengers and their belongings after the Central Industrial Security Force conducts the mandatory checks. SLPC is done by airline officials just before passengers exit the boarding point.
