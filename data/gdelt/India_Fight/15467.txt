It has been revealed that one of the victims who died in the new Zealand mosque shootings on Friday was a woman from Kerala. The victim has been identified as 25-year-old Anshi from Kodungallur in central Kerala. The state government has assured necessary assistance for the family to bring back her dead body.

Anshi and her husband Abdul Nassar had been living in New Zealand for over an year. Anshi was pursuing her Masters Degree in agriculture. Abdul Nassar was working in a private firm. Anshi used to work in a supermarket as a part-time employee.

Anshi's family received the information about the tragedy on Saturday late evening. The family has been told that Anshi and Abdul Nassar were in the mosque when the attack took place. The couple tried to run away after seeing the armed terrorist. While, Anshi was shot from behind, Abdul Nassar managed to escape unhurt in the attack.

His relatives have told India Today that the mortal remains will be handed over to the family by tonight or by Monday morning.

The government has assured that the mortal remains will be brought back to Kerala within four days. Meanwhile, some organisations in New Zealand have requested that Anshi be cremated in New Zealand itself, which will later be turned into a memorial. However, her family has turned down the request.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who expressed shock and grief over the tragedy, has assured full support for the family. The CMO has also directed Non Residential Keralaites Association (NORKA) to take action and help bring Anshi's mortal remains back to Kerala.
