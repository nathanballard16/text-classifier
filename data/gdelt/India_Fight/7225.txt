India and Pakistan 'on brink of another major conflict' after Kashmir attack

Dr Chacko said the Indian government took a similar hardline in the 1980s which resulted in a backlash from the Kashmiris, and an insurgency. She says the fact the suicide bomber in the latest attack was a local man shows the same sort of radicalisation could be happening again: "People are becoming despondent and are resorting to more violence."

What next?

The latest attack and suggestion of further conflict has dashed hopes for peace anytime soon.

India has vowed to use all its might to isolate Pakistan from the international community.

The US sided with India following the Kashmir attack, whereas China is an ally of Pakistan.

"It's so difficult to have a resolution to this situation," ANU's Dr Rakisits said, adding it was bad for both countries.

"It's stupid, it's costing money, it's hampering social development, but because of bad blood it's extremely difficult."

He believes that for any negotiations for a peace deal to happen, India would want Pakistan to hand over leaders of terrorist groups implicated in the Mumbai attacks in 2008: "Pakistan would want something in return, possibly a referendum."

The nuclear factor

Dr Rakisits says the situation could escalate if the conflict ever spreads out of Kashmir. Until now, the violence has stayed within the region, "however, if today, or tomorrow, they hit Punjab or somewhere not Kashmir, that's deep, deep trouble. That's war. Possibly going into the nukes," he says.

India has a policy it won't be the first to use nuclear weapons, but Dr Rakisits says Pakistan won't take that at face value: "What is the threshold before Pakistan use their nukes? That is not something Modi wants to play around with."
