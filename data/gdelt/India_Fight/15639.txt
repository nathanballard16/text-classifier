The official said that the naval assets were parts of an exercise, but all these were shifted from the drill to operational mode soon after the Pulwama attack on February 14 in which 44 CRPF soldiers lost their lives.

In the tri-service press conference held on February 28, the Indian Navy had said that high state of readiness is exercise to "deter, prevent and defeat" any "misadventure" by Pakistan in the seas.

"The major combat units of the Indian Navy including the Carrier Battle Group with INS Vikramaditya, nuclear submarines and scores of other ships, submarines and aircraft swiftly transited from exercise to operational deployment mode as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated," Navy Spokesperson Capt D K Sharma said.

Initially the theatre level operational readiness exercise TROPEX 19 which comprised 60 ships of the Indian Navy, 12 ships of the Indian Coast Guard and 60 aircraft. The exercise commenced on January 19 in Andaman and Nicobar islands and was to remain operational till March 10.

But after Pulwama attack, exercise was taken to operational mode.

"The overwhelming superiority of Indian Navy in all three dimensions -- on the surface, under-sea and in air -- forced the Pakistan Navy to remain deployed close to the Makran coast and not venture out in the open ocean," he said.
