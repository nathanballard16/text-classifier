Kartik captioned his post, "#ChintuTyagi Leaving behind one character... his world and getting into another character is painful yet a fun process. Perk of being an actor. You get to live so many lives in one life. #PatiPatniAurWoh." Take a look below.

Earlier this week, Kartik had shared a photo of himself on Instagram while he was heading to Lucknow to start the shoot of his movie. Post that, the actor also shared how he was welcomed to the 'Nawabon ka Sheher'.
