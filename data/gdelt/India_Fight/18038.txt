Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar are undoubtedly one of the cutest couples we've ever seen. The lovebirds first met in 1999 during the mahurat of Namrata's film, Vamsi. Various reports suggest that it was love at first sight, but the cuties chose to keep their relationship under wraps. After a courtship of five years, Namrata and Mahesh tied the knot in 2005 only to constantly shell out couple goals for us. Since then, Namrata has been Mahesh's loudest cheerleader and her recent picture is proof.

Sharing a picture from the sets of Mahesh's next release, Maharshi, Namrata wrote, "setting the mood ...My man in blue on sets #maharshi" Dressed in a sharp indigo blue shirt over trousers, Mahesh seems to be deep in thought and the proud wife can't stop crushing. Check out the picture here.

On the work front, Mahesh has been busy with his next project, Maharshi that is slotted to hit silver screens on May 9. Ahead of the film's release, the makers released the first single from the film, Choti Choti Baatein starring Pooja Hegde and Allari Naresh. The journey song instantly became a hit with the audience and cine-goers who can't stop humming the song. The team has been working hard to finish the schedule. After a long schedule in the United States of America, the team has also shot in Pollachi and as per a report in Indian Express, the film has been shot in Abu Dhabi and Hyderabad.

In an earlier given interview to Deccan Chronicle, Namrata revealed, "You know, people believe Mahesh does what I ask him to. That's not true. He may look shy and gentle, but, he knows his mind. All his career decisions are taken by him, although he does share the plot and script idea with me casually. Yes, if he dresses differently from the other actors in Andhra Pradesh, I could have influenced his sartorial choices."

Stay tuned.
