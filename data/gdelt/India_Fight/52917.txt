India Successfully Tests Supersonic BrahMos Cruise Missile in Arabian Sea

Increasing the missile's range became possible after India's induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime in 2016. India's Defence Research and Development Organisation has claimed that another version of the missile with a strike range of up to 800 km is under development.

The Indian Airforce also carried out two tests of its BrahMos surface-to-surface missiles from mobile launchers in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October. The Air Force claimed that the missiles had hit its targets with pinpoint accuracy on Trak Island, a part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Indian defence scientists conducted a series of tests of its nuclear-capable missiles, such as the Agni 2, Prithvi, and Brahmos supersonic cruise missile while the Pakistani military carried out tests of Shaheen 1 and other surface to air ballistic missile.

The tests came against the backdrop of persistent firing at the India-Pakistan border for the last three months after New Delhi revoked the special status granted to the disputed region of Kashmir on 5 August.
