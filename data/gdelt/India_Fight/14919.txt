Protests, blockades continue

Police step up security in Pollachi; ‘Bar’ Nagaraj denies allegations

Pollachi sexual abuse case continued to trigger protests and demonstrations in various parts of the State on Thursday.

Nam Tamilar Katchi staged a demonstration near the Red Cross Society building here condemning alleged inaction by the police in the case. They raised slogans against the police.

The All India Students’ Federation and the All India Youth Federation staged a road blockade near Gandhipuram bus stand in Coimbatore.

A section of students from the Government Law College in Coimbatore and a few other colleges in Pollachi boycotted classes.

The police had increased the strength in sensitive areas in Pollachi, at the houses of the complainant and accused.

Meanwhile, A. Nagaraj aka ‘Bar’ Nagaraj, who was arrested by the Coimbatore Rural Police for allegedly assaulting the brother of the complainant in the case, on Thursday petitioned Coimbatore District Collector stating that he was not among the group of men who were seen harassing a girl in a recently leaked video.

Nagaraj, a former office bearer of Amma Peravai at Ward 34 in Pollachi, also stated in the petition that he was not linked to the sexual abuse case. He was later granted bail.

Nagaraj, who was expelled from AIADMK on Monday, said that his political and personal life was hit after falsehood is spread in news reports and social media platforms. This was causing mental trauma on him and his family

Nagaraj also released a video in which he said that some visual media had portrayed him as one of the perpetrators seen in the leaked video of harassing a girl. “The media portrayed me as the perpetrator though it was Sathish (29), one of the four accused arrested in the sexual abuse case, who is seen in the video” said Nagaraj.
