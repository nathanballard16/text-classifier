‘Gandhi ji must be weeping in Heaven; wishes he hadn’t been shot by Hindu fanatic’

Former Cheif Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti reacted to a tweet on social media platform mentioning that former Home Minister of India, Sarder Vallabh Bhai Patel ‘must be weeping’ listening to comments by Ms. Mufti and National Conference’s president Farooq Abdullah on Article 370 of the Indian constitution, she said, “Somewhere in heaven, Gandhi ji is weeping looking at how muslims & other minorities are being harassed & punished in his beloved India.”

The president of Peoples’ Democratic Party, Ms. Mufti also added on her Twitter handle that, “He (Gandhi) wishes he hadn’t been shot by a Hindu fanatic. Maybe disaster could have been averted.”

The Twitter mishap came after Hindol Sengupta, a political writer, mentioned Ms. Mufti and Mr. Abdullah in a tweet saying that late Mr. Patel must be thinking, “If only Jawahar had listened, he must be saying…”

The hotch-potch surfaced after Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto appealing to abrogate Article 370 and 35-A, which grants the special status to the state of J-K.
