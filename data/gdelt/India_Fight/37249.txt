Triple Talaq Bill against Muslims, clashes with constitutional rights: Majeed Memon

New Delhi: The Triple Talaq Bill clashes with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian constitution and is against Muslims. It can be challenged in Supreme Court. But more than that what is necessary is to launch Islah-e-Mashera campaign so that Muslims need not go to court. These views were expressed by Rajya Sabha member advocate Majeed Memon.

He said, if government was sincere enough it would have sent the Bill to the Select Committee in 2017 itself.

Majeed Memon claimed that the bill is an attempt to break family unit of Muslims, land Muslim men in jails and to force Muslim women and children to run from pillar to post. Hence it should be condemned and opposed from all quarters.
