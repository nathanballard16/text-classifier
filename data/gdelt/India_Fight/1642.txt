Delhi High Court seeks police report in counsellor death case

Manchanda, counsel of the woman’s parents, alleged, “she was killed within five months of her marriage, and was two months pregnant at the time”. It directed police to file a status report in the matter before the next date of hearing, February 15. However, her parents, in their plea alleged that she was murdered, following which her husband and father-in-law were arrested by police. The Delhi High Court has sought the stand of police on a plea by the parents of a 27-year-old woman, who worked as a counsellor for an NGO associated with the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), accusing her in-laws and husband of murder and dowry harassment. Advocate Prashant Manchanda, appearing for the woman’s parents, also challenged the trial court’s December 20, 2018 order, expressing his apprehension that in its order, the trial court appears to have given its final conclusion in the matter, which may be used by other parties in the case to avail themselves of bail.
