TN moves Apex Court challenging NGT order favouring Sterlite Copper reopening

Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government has moved the Supreme Court challenging the recent order of National Green Tribunal setting aside a May 2018 Government Order closing Vedanta-owned Sterlite Copper and directing the state pollution control board to renew an operating licence of the 4-lakh-a-tonne factory within three weeks, according to people aware of the litigation.The case is expected to be listed for hearing soon.Tamil Nadu had closed the copper plant six days after 13 people were killed in police firing against protesters who wanted the factory closed on grounds that it polluted the environment. In its findings, the Tarun Agrawal committee set up by the NGT to investigate environmental impact said violations were not "that grievous" to warrant closure of the factory.Tamil Nadu government has been battling a legal war with Sterlite Copper since July last year, when the company moved the National Green Tribunal against its closure order. On May 28, Tamil Nadu government endorsed a pollution board order shuttering the factory on grounds that it was undertaking production-related activities in the absence of a renewed Consent to Operate.The state government had laid a series of hurdles in the path of Sterlite’s expansion plans such as withdrawing Consent to Establish for the second plant and so on.Sterlite Copper won a major breakthrough in the December 15 order of the NGT that set aside the closure order of Tamil Nadu. It had also applied with the state pollution control board for a new licence (Consent Toi Operate) to enable the reopening of the plant.Sterlite Copper CEO P Ramnath had announced expenditure of Rs 100 crore to improve social infrastructure in Thoothukudi The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, on a petition filed by Anti-Sterlite protester and MDMK politician Fatima Babu, has ordered status quo on the implementation of the NGT order until January 21.
