Twenty-four young Bangladeshis, who illegally crossed into India and were detained, have been returned to their homeland.

After finishing all the necessary paperwork, the Benapole Port police station handed over the 24 individuals to a Bangladeshi non-governmental organization (NGO), named Jessore Rights, around 11pm on Friday.

The Bangladeshi NGO will work to ensure that the victims are reunited with their respective families.

The human trafficking victims are from the Satkhira, Jessore, and Bagerhat districts.

The youths crossed the Bangladesh-India border and entered into India with the help of human traffickers, and were later caught by the Indian immigration police and sent to different jails in Andhra Pradesh.

Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune Benapole port police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Md Abul Basar said: "The youths were handed over to Bangladeshi officials around 11.30am by the Indian Benapole immigration police."

An Indian NGO, Talash Association, aided in ensuring that the youths were returned to Bangladesh safely, in a legal manner.

The victims claimed that due to extreme poverty they went into India; the human traffickers had made false promises that they would provide them better jobs.

However, the youths were arrested by the Indian Border Security Force (BSF).

Later the court sent them to the Vijapur and Cornetto jails of Andhra Pradesh, India, where they served for two to four years.

Some of victims were minors at the time they crossed the border to India.
