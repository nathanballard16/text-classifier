New Delhi: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court found Dinu Bogha Solanki, the former Bharatiya Janata MP from Junagadh and six others guilty, including Solanki’s nephew, in the murder of Right to Information (RTI) activist Amit Jethwa.

The RTI activist was shot dead on July 20, 2010, as he tried to expose the illegal mining activist in Gir forest region, the habitat of Asiatic lions. He was shot right outside the Gujarat High Court.

Special CBI judge KM Dave is yet to hand a sentence to the seven men found guilty of Jethwa’s murder. The final sentence will be given on July 11 in the case.

The investigation was handed over to the central agency by Ahmedabad Detection Crime Branch (DCB) who gave a clean chit to Solanki in the case. Jethwa’s father had moved the High Court against Solanki who was later arrested from Delhi.

The DCB had charge-sheeted five other persons other than Solanki including Shailesh Pandya, Bahadursinh Vadher, Panchan G Desai, Sanjay Chauhan and Udaji Thakore.

All six including Solanki, who represented Junagadh from 2004 to 2009, were charged with murder and criminal conspiracy.

Charges of murder and criminal conspiracy were framed against the seven accused, including Dinu Solanki, in May 2016.
