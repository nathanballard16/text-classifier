Actor Soumitra Chatterjee stable but has breathing problem, says family

Kolkata: Legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee is in stable condition at the hospital but has cough and breathing problems, his family said Thursday.

Chatterjee is still under observation at ICU but his condition is better than Wednesday, his daughter Poulomi Basu told PTI.

“Baba talked to me this morning but he had difficulty in speaking due to cough. He has been advised not to speak much,” she said.

To a question, Basu said the doctors did not tell the family how long Chatterjee would be kept in the ICU. “We have been told he will be under observation for some more time.”

Actor Shankar Chakraborty, who went to visit Chatterjee at the hospital but could not meet him due to restrictions, said “I heard from the hospital and his family that he is in stable condition and showing signs of improvement. We all pray for his speedy recovery.”

Chatterjee was admitted to a private hospital here Wednesday after he complained of breathing problems. A hospital statement had said Wednesday that he is suffering from respiratory tract infection and is out of danger.

The 84-year-old actor in his six-decade-long career acted in over 250 films. He featured in 14 films by Satyajit Ray, including in ‘Apur Sansar’, the last of the famed Apu Trilogy and the maestro’s penultimate ‘Sakha Prasakha’.

He had also featured in a number of films by Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and modern day directors and had been a recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and Legion d’honour from the French government.

The actor had attended shoots apart from gracing events till Monday, industry sources said. Chatterjee is also a poet, non-fiction writer, theatre personality and elocutionist.
