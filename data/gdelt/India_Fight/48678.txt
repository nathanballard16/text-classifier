Alleging sale of election tickets and nepotism, BSP workers on Tuesday blackened the faces of party national coordinator Ramji Gautam and former state in-charge Sitaram Meghwal and paraded them on donkeys with shoe-garlands hung around their neck, outside the party office here.

Reacting sharply to the incident, BSP supremo Mayawati tweeted: “First the Congress caused defections among the BSP MLAs and now it is trying to hurt the movement.”

Gautam and Meghwal were present in the BSP office at the Bani Park area when scores of workers stormed the building raising slogans against the two leaders.

The protesters alleged the party’s office-bearers indulged in sale of poll tickets to non-deserving candidates.

They alleged that MLA Rajendra Gudha — now with the Congress — had openly made accusations against the party on the floor of the assembly during the last session.

On September 16, six MLAs — Rajendra Gudha, Joginder Awana, Lakhan Singh, Deechand Kheria, Sandeep Yadav and Wajib had joined the Congress after submitting a joint letter to the Speaker.

Mayawati had appointed Sumrat Singh as the new BSP president in Rajasthan and formed the executive committee last month.

No office-bearer was available for comment. The police have so far not received any complaint regarding the incident.
