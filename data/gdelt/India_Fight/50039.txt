An enormous bull elephant named Osama bin Laden has trampled five people to death while on a horrifying rampage in India.

The rogue elephant attacked the Bolatar village in the north-eastern state of Assam earlier this week.

Locals named the beast after the 9/11 mastermind following previous attacks and the repeated destruction of their crops.

Rajen Rabnha, a local villager, said: “In the past Laden has also attacked our villages and killed people and destroyed our paddy fields.”

The local authorities have now launched a major operation to contain the territorial killer.

Drones and trained elephants are being used to track down the deadly jumbo from a "safe distance." Assam’s forest minister said a special committee including wildlife experts would decide what to do with the elephant. However, he insisted it would be taking into account the welfare of the elephant as well as the safety of locals. “We are yet to decide on how to deal with the animal,” Parimal Shuklabaidya said. “There are suggestions that we should tranquillise the animal and take it to forest where there is no human habitation nearby.” (Image: Assam Forest Department/AFP via) Animal stories Dogs rescue sticky pup

Cat versus dog! The welfare of the elephant as well as the safety of locals’ would be taken into account, Mr Shuklabaidya added. Laden was last spotted in the Kantaka Reserve on Thursday, local news reported. “We have located and identified Laden in the reserve, which is about 15km from Tuesday’s incident site,” a forest officer said.
