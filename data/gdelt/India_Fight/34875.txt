Xiaomi claims it offers 133 per cent better quality than Realme, Realme trolls Redmi K20 pricing

Xiaomi just announced the Redmi K20 and K20 Pro in India. Before the company started speaking about the two new premium mid-range devices during the launch event, it highlighted some personal achievements in the Indian market such as being the number 1 smartphone brand in the country for the seventh consecutive quarter and the number 1 smart TV brand as well. Among its list of accomplishments, the company also mentioned that it is now the number 1 quality brand in India, claiming a 133 per cent higher product quality compared to Realme based on data provided by RedQuanta.

Xiaomi Global VP Manu Kumar Jain explained that the data provided by RedQuanta is based on FFR (Field Failure Rate) which analyses the number of defective devices among a set of say 100 devices. So a lower FFR means higher quality, which is where Xioami is leading the table with Samsung in second place. Of course, this also gave the company a good chance to take a pot shot at Realme, its biggest rival right now.

Xiaomi and Realme often take digs at each other during launch events or on social media for obvious reasons. Realme, which launched in India last year, has achieved tremendous success by offering value for money smartphones in a kind of disruptive manner that Xiaomi has over the years.

Realme recently launched the Realme X (Review) in India starting at Rs 16,999 touting a notchless AMOLED display, 48MP dual camera setup, pop-up selfie camera and Snapdragon 710. Following the launch of the Realme X, Xiaomi took some jabs at Realme by trolling the phone's Snapdragon 710 chipset. Naturally, this made everyone believe that the Redmi K20 with a Snapdragon 730 chipset would launch in India directly competing against the Realme X.

Time to Kill the Hype as Real Hype is here! As #realmeX is still the most premium smartphone:

- Real Full Screen Super AMOLED Display

- Pop-Up Camera

- In-screen Fingerprint Sensor

- 48 + 5MP Rear Camera

- Decent performing SD710

All premium features at Rs.16,999. So #WhyPayMore? Madhav X (@MadhavSheth1) July 17, 2019

However, the Redmi K20 has been launched starting at Rs 21,999, which puts in a different segment than the Realme X. This, then, gave Realme a chance to hit back at Xiaomi, taking shots at the pricing of the Redmi K20 in comparison to the Realme X. Realme India CEO Madhav Sheth tweeted about the Realme X's key features soon after the Redmi K20 launch event, saying that the Realme X is "still the most premium smartphone" with a price of Rs 16,999.

In another tweet, Sheth added that customers who had purchased a Flipkart voucher of Rs 855 during the Redmi K20 Alpha Sale can use the deposit money to buy the Realme X. Both Xiaomi and Realme love firing shots at each other, and it doesn't look like this exchange is going to stop any time soon.
