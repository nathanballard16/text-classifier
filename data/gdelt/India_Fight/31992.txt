One-month-old girl is killed by a monkey after it pounces on her milk bottle in India

A one-month-old girl has been killed by a monkey which jumped into her cot to steal her milk bottle in India.

The child and her mother, named by the Times of India as Sunita Devi, had been at home in Junavai, Sambhal district on Saturday last week when the terrifying incident took place.

Ms Devi was reportedly working near a verandah where the baby was lying in her cot when the monkey swooped down and tried to grab the bottle.

She said the monkey had been sitting on the roof of the house when it noticed the bottle and suddenly attacked.

After spotting the monkey hovering over her baby's cot she raised the alarm and family members emerged from inside the house to try and force it away.

But by the time the primate fled with the bottle Ms Devi's child had suffered serious injuries.

She rushed the infant to a local hospital but doctors pronounced her dead on arrival.

Doctors said shortly afterwards the baby had suffered fatal internal injuries.

Monkey attacks have killed a total of four people in the Sambal district this year alone.
