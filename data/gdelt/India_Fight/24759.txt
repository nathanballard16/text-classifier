Sam Pitroda's hua toh hua comment on 1984 anti-Sikh riots reflects Congress's mentality: PM Modi

Sam Pitroda's 'hua toh hua [it just happened]' remark on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots reflects the Congress's mentality and character, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday while addressing a rally in Haryana's Rohtak.

PM Modi also said that Congress leader Sam Pitroda's 'hua toh hua' statement on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots shows how arrogant the party is.

"Yesterday, one of the top Congress leaders said the 1984 riots just happened ['hua toh hua']. These three words sum up the arrogance of Congress. These words were not spoken just like that. They show the party's psyche," PM Modi told an election meeting on the last day of campaigning for the sixth phase of Lok Sabha polls.

He said, "'Hua toh hua' this reflects Congress's mentality. Not a single person accused in the 1984 Sikh riot was punished. This is Congress's arrogance that they were reduced to 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The public will bring the party down even more [in the 2019 Lok Sabha election]."





Upping the ante against Sam Pitroda and the Congress, PM Modi, without naming the Congress leader, said, "The leader is close to the Gandhi family, a good friend of [the late] Rajiv Gandhi and a 'guru' [mentor] of Rahul Gandhi."

PM Modi said while hundreds of Sikhs were burnt to death with petrol and diesel with burning tyres flung around their necks, "the Congress is saying 'hua toh hua'."

"Thousands of Sikhs were killed outside their homes but today the Congress is saying 'hua toh Hua'. Sikhs were targeted in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and other states. The rioters were led by Congress. This sin was committed by every small Congress leader, but today the Congress is saying, 'hua toh hua'," Modi said.

"We can very well understand arrogance of those who run the Congress in these three words- hua to Hua," said Modi.
