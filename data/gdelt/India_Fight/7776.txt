Not surprised by Sena-BJP alliance, says Sharad Pawar

They came together for power and not because of the ED’s fear!” said NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

Mumbai: “I am not surprised that the Shiv Sena and BJP have inked the alliance as I have been telling media that they will contest elections together. Voters are wise and know how BJP and Sena have been working and they will vote wisely! They came together for power and not because of the ED’s fear!” said NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

He also said that though the meeting of all parties was called by the Parliamentary Affairs Committee chaired by Rajnath Singh on the day after the Pulwama attack, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi was absent from the meeting and for that matter, no BJP leaders attended it. Although Singh was present, he was there only in the capacity of PAC! The PM was attacking the Opposition at Dhule and Yavatmal. “It shows the BJP’s seriousness over such serious matters. But let’s not talk about this as the attack is on our country,” said Mr Pawar.

Mr Pawar sarcastically said that the BJP would win all 48 seats in the state after being asked about the BJP claiming to win 45 seats including Baramati. He said the BJP would also win Baramati. He also said that Ajit Pawar, Parth Pawar and Rohit Pawar would not contest the Lok Sabha elections.
