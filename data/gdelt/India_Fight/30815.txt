Why has the Madras High Court been overlooked in appointments to the Supreme Court?

“That there is plenty of legal intelligence in this country, both Indian and English, of that I am satisfied. More than once the Privy Council have openly complimented the Indian judges in this country, from the time of the late Mr Justice Mahmood of Allahabad down to recent days upon the possession of the legal and judicial intelligence not inferior to their own. And I have no doubt whatever that if and when this Supreme Court comes into existence, we shall find plenty of indigenous talent, English and Indian, to discharge with intellectual credit the grave and varied functions of an accomplished court of final jurisdiction.”
