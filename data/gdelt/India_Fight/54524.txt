Prabhas goes on holiday. Again!

Actor Prabhas was supposed to start shoot in Hyderabad for his upcoming film with director Radhakrishna. The film unit, we hear, has even erected a set in a private studio for the shoot, but for the moment, the shoot is not happening. While no one can confirm on what happened, sources tell us that Prabhas will soon be leaving again to a foreign destination on a vacation.

The filmmakers are in a dilemma as they don’t know when they can shoot the film. We also hear that actress Pooja Hegde, who plays the female lead, is relaxing in Mumbai because of the delay in the shoot. “The producers plan to start the shoot from January next year once Prabhas is back from his vacation,” says a source. Incidentally, Prabhas had been to Europe for vacation recently. Given that he’s back on a vacation abroad has sparked rumours about these abroad trips.
