War is easily one of the most promising films of Bollywood commercially and the only problem in its way was a clash with Sidharth Malhotra & Tara Sutaria’s upcoming film Marjaavaan. The clash would’ve made both films share screen space and thus denting the potential of both.

However, now it seems the makers of Marjaavaan have decided to change their release date and not come on October 2. Reportedly, YRF’s big film will come solo on Gandhi Jayanti and will also get the biggest release ever beating the release size of Thugs Of Hindostan.

It’s being said that War will release on around 5000 screens in India and that’s humongous.

Interestingly, the chasing and hunting scenes in War have been shot in seven different countries, said the film’s director Siddharth Anand.

“‘War‘ is one of the most visually stunning films of our times and we have shot Hrithik and Tiger chasing and hunting against each other in seven different countries. We had to travel to Australia to shoot one of the key moments in the film,” Anand said in a statement.

One of chasing sequence is shot in the famous Bondi Beach in Australia for a crucial shooting schedule.

“Australia is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and Bondi Beach is the most picturesque beach that I have ever come across in my life. Since the scene needed to be visually striking, we locked on Bondi Beach for the film. The scene is a big moment in the film and we won’t be able to disclose much about it currently,” he added.
