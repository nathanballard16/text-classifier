Srinagar

Thousands of people poured onto the streets of Nunar, when the body of slain engineering student- turned militant Rahil Rashid Sheikh reached home.

Reports said that thousands of people on Sunday attended the funeral prayers of slain militant Rahil in Nunar village of Ganderbal.

They said amid pro-freedom, pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans the slain militant Rahil’s funeral was held at his native village Nunar.

Rahil was killed along with an associate in a gunfight with government forces in Padguchi village of Imam Sahib area of south Kashmir’s Shopian district on Saturday. Rahil had reportedly joined Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militant outfit on April 3.

Meanwhile, clashes erupted between protesters and the government forces deployed in the area shortly after the culmination of last rites of the Rahil.

The curfew-like restrictions have been imposed in Ganderbal amid fears of widespread protests against the militant’s killing.
