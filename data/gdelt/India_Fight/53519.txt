Amitabh shoots in minus 3 degrees

A few days ago, Amitabh Bachchan had expressed the desire to "retire from films," however, looks like the megastar doesn't really want to stop working. At least not right away.

It is reported that Big B is currently shooting for his upcoming film Brahmastra alongside Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor in Himachal Pradesh, and a new photograph of him from the film set has become the highlight of the day.

There are three reasons for the same, one is that Amitabh is shooting in -3 degree Celsius in the state, the second is his cool look which has garnered an interesting reaction from his daughter Shweta Bachchan, and finally because of who he shares the frame with.

Amitabh Bachchan himself shared the picture on both Instagram and Twitter. On Instagram, Big B captioned it as, "the minus degrees .. the biting cold .. and the protective gear."

In the photo, Amitabh Bachchan is seen wearing a pair of tinted sunglasses with a black jacket and red checkered shirt.

Various media reports suggest that Amitabh Bachchan has joined Alia and Ranbir in Manali and is shooting his part for Brahmastra. In fact, the posts on his blog also hint that he is in North India. _Agencies
