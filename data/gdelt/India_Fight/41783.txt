A woman in Bengaluru was arrested on Saturday by police in Hassan district for allegedly murdering her father with the help of her paramour and his accomplice. The other two accused are also in the custody of the police. The accused trio are all residents of Byadarahalli and nearby areas in the city.

The Times of India reported that the woman has been identified as Vidya. The police said she allegedly killed her father Muniraju with the help of Chidananada, her paramour and his accomplice Raghu. According to the police, Muniraju was a cab driver.

The Alur police in Hassan started investigating the murder on August 26 after they found Muniraju’s body in the backwaters of Hemavathi in Hassan district’s Maniganahalli.

Police said the body had ligature marks and evident signs of stabbing. He was reportedly murdered on August 23.

Incidentally, VIdya had given a missing complaint’s case in Bengaluru and subsequently identified the body when Alur police discovered the body.

After beginning their probe, the police tracked call records of Muniraju, which led them to Chidananda.

After being picked up by police, Chidananda spilled the beans during interrogation and said that Vidya had given him Rs 15 lakh to kill her father. Vidya was unhappy with her father objecting to her relationship with Chidananda.

A Daijiworld report said that Muniraju did not approve Vidya being with Chidananda and told her to end the relationship as she was married for the second time. Vidya was unhappy with her father objecting to her relationship with Chidananda which led her to plot the murder.

Police said Muniraju was killed with the help of an axe, cable and a knife.
