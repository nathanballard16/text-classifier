Will take foreign diplomats & media on locations to present facts: DG ISPR

RAWALPINDI: DG ISPR Major General Asif Ghafoor tweeted on Monday that he would take diplomats and media on the given locations where India claimed it destroyed three alleged militant camps in Pakistan, to present the actual facts on ground.



"Indians have no grounds to support false claim made by their COAS. If they don’t want to go they have the option to share claimed targeted locations with our foreign office. We will take foreign diplomats & media tomorrow on those given locations. Let all see facts on ground," he tweeted.



Dismissing the Indian army chief's claim, the DG ISPR had tweeted on Sunday: "Indian COAS’ statement claiming destruction of 3 alleged camps in AJK is disappointing as he holds a very responsible appointment."



Gen Ghafoor maintained that there were no camps let alone targeting them. He offered the Indian embassy in Pakistan to take any foreign diplomat or media to prove it on ground.

He said the propensity of false claim by senior Indian military leadership especially since the Pulwama incident was detrimental to peace in the region, saying such claims by the Indian Army were being made to suit the vested domestic interests. "This is against professional military ethos," he said.

At least five civilians and a Pakistani soldier were martyred as Indian troops resorted to "indiscriminate and ruthless" shelling from across LoC in AJK on Sunday.

According to ISPR, one soldier had been martyred in the exchange of fire while two others were injured.

The military’s media wing added that in response to unprovoked ceasefire violations by India in Jura, Shahkot and Nauseri sectors, nine Indian soldiers were killed while several others were injured and two Indian bunkers were destroyed.

The targeting of innocent civilians by Indian Army was an attempt to justify their false claims of targeting alleged camps, according to ISPR.
