At that time, I didn’t know the name of the police, but certainly looking at that uniform and the sharp-looking police officers, it piqued my curiosity as a young kid,” Chauhan recalled this week.

Back to video He didn’t know then that he would end up in Canada a few years later after the death of his brother and father in a farming accident. He didn’t know then that he would join the red serge-wearing Mounties after completing university in Ontario. Now Chauhan has been appointed the officer in charge of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team — Canada’s largest murder investigation squad. The 50-year-old RCMP veteran told Postmedia that he is up for the challenge after spending two years as IHIT’s operations support officer.

Article content “I am just so impressed with the hard work and the dedication from all of our investigators and our civilian support staff that they put forward on a daily basis to bring that closure and bring that justice to the families. I wanted to continue to be part of that team,” he said. “IHIT is operating at its finest level right now.” Chauhan has been in the RCMP since 1991, spending several years in Prince George in roles ranging from general duties to serious crime investigations. It was there that he worked on his first murder case. In 2005, he moved to the Lower Mainland to take a posting with E-Division’s Serious Crime Unit, where he spent almost two years working on the successful Greeks gang murder investigation in Vernon.

Article content PNG Gang leader Peter Manolakos and his associates, Leslie Podolski, Dale Sipes, Leslie Podolski, Sheldon O’Donnell and Douglas Brownell, were all convicted in 2012 of various roles in the slayings of David Marnuik, Thomas Bryce and Ronald Thom in the Vernon area between July 2004 and May 2005. In 2007, Chauhan was put in charge of investigating the B.C. relatives of Jassi Sidhu, who were suspected of having arranged the young woman’s murder in Punjab in June 2000. “It is a real tragedy that a young, beautiful girl who went to India was killed because she went against her parents’ wishes to marry someone who was below caste,” Chauhan said. “So a lot of hard work was put into that investigation, which ultimately led to the extradition of those two individuals.”

Article content In January 2019, after a seven-year court battle, Sidhu’s mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu, and uncle, Surjit Singh Badesha, were extradited to India to face a charge of conspiracy to commit murder.

Chauhan said the extradition “was quite gratifying to see.” “Finally, after all the legal hurdles were cleared, they were going to be tried for the crime.” Even when he was still in Prince George, Chauhan had wanted to be part of IHIT, which was started in 2003 and now has 110 investigators and support staff responsible for most murder investigations across the Lower Mainland and as far away as Pemberton and Boston Bar. “But there were no openings at that point,” he said. He went on to become the provincial DNA co-ordinator, while continuing “to work on serious complex investigations,” he said.

Article content In 2015, he was promoted to staff-sergeant in charge of Surrey’s Major Crime Section, where he led a number of high-profile shooting investigations that ended with successful prosecutions. Some of IHIT’s future may be uncertain as Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum pushes to implement a new municipal force to replace the RCMP. If the new force decides not to contact IHIT to do its murder investigations, the number of officers on the squad would likely drop. “I would imagine so,” Chauhan said when asked if resources would be reduced. “But that is yet to be determined. Obviously, Surrey has resources that are part of IHIT.” Several municipal police forces, such as Abbotsford, New Westminster and Port Moody, are currently part of IHIT. Vancouver and Delta police forces investigate their own murder cases.

Article content “As far as I am concerned, whoever is partnered with IHIT, we will continue to provide good and strong police services to that community,” Chauhan said. IHIT maintains a case clearance rate of about 60 per cent, and is currently working on more than 200 unsolved cases. Sometimes it takes years to collect enough evidence to meet the high threshold necessary to get charges approved in B.C., he said. “Our investigators continue to produce excellent work. Last year, for example, we had 21 convictions and 15 charges that were laid. So it fluctuates. I don’t think any police department has the ability to solve every single unsolved homicide case that they have, but we continue to put forward a strong effort in trying to solve these cases and to bring justice to the families.” kbolan@postmedia.com blog: vancouversun.com/tag/real-scoop twitter.com/kbolan
