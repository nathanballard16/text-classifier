Meaning of Abhinandan will change now, says Modi

Abhinandan used to mean congratulations, but it will change, he said while inaugurating a conference on construction technology.

New Delhi: The meaning of “Abhinandan” will change now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday, referring to the Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan Vartha-man, who was released by Pakistan on March 1.

Abhinandan used to mean congratulations, but it will change, he said while inaugurating a conference on construction technology. The world takes note of what India does and the nation has the power to “change dictionary meanings”, he added.

His remarks came a day after IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to India by Pakistan after being in captivity for nearly three days.

He was captured on February 27 by Pakistan following a dogfight between the two air forces in which his MIG-21 was shot down.

“Take it for fact, the world watches carefully what India does. The country has the strength to change the meaning of words in the dictionary. Abhinandan once used to mean congratulations in English. And now the meaning of Abhinandan will change. This is the strength of this country,” Mr Modi said amid applause by the audience. The PM said the country has to move ahead with “valour”.

Meanwhile Mr Modi declared ‘April 2019-March 2020’ as Construction-Technology year and stressed on use of advanced technology to meet the increasing demand of housing in the country caused by rapid urbanisation. He also sought the support of the private sector in fulfilling the government’s mission of providing brick house to every Indian by 2022.

At the inauguration of the Construction Technol-ogy India-2019 Expo-cum-conference, the PM said his government has given a major thrust on affordable housing and brought changes in laws governing the real estate sector.
