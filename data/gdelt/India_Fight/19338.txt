Jaipur: With more than 4.84 crore voters, Rajasthan is a significant state for political parties from the electoral perspective. Lok Sabha elections will be held in two phases in Rajasthan where 13 constituencies will go to polls on April 29 and remaining 12 seats on May 6.

Agriculture has always been a crucial poll issue in Rajasthan, where about 70 per cent of the population lives in villages. Mirror Now ground report from Rajasthan bares the truth and we spoke with the farmers of Bundi, where they struggle with water scarcity, electricity, fertilizers & even a decent Minimum Support Price.

The female farmers claimed that they have to face a major problem of water, electricity and even the roads are not constructed well. Moreover, farm loan waiver is a common issue across the length and breadth of the desert state and through Mirror Now the debt-ridden farmers shared their woes.

The farmers further mentioned that they had launched their agitation at Sikar district over unfulfilled loan waiver promises and the government failed to give Minimum Support Price for their produce.

The farmers in Rajasthan, hit by a major agrarian crisis, said that the Government has made promises to them, but none of the parties actually walked the talk.

Months after facing defeat in Rajasthan assembly polls last year, the BJP is all set to sweep the desert state in the coming Lok Sabha elections wherein the Congress is unlikely to take the advantage of its assembly elections victory over the saffron party in the general elections.
