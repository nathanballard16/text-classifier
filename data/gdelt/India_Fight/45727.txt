Lal Bahadur Shastri's call for "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" inspired the soldiers and the farmers to save the country at the border and from hunger strike. The slogan became hugely popular and filled the country with newer enthusiasm to defend it internally and externally.

Do or Die (Karo Ya Maro)

"Do or die" became a very popular slogan during India's fight for freedom against the British. Mahatma Gandhi had coined the slogan during a meeting of the All India Congress Committee which took place on August 7, 1942. On the next day, Quit India resolution was passed with an overwhelming majority which declared the immediate end of British rule in India. The slogan was widely accepted with people ready to lay their lives to get India its independence from the British rule.
