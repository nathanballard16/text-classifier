5 killed in UP road accident

Lucknow: Five persons, including a two-year-old, were killed while five others critically injured in a road mishap in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district on Wednesday, police said.

The accident took place in the wee hours when, apparently due to fog and poor, visibility, a Bolero SUV rammed into the rear of a truck parked at a roadside eatery.

The vehicle was carrying 10 persons, all residents of Etawah, who had gone to attend a funeral.

The deceased have been identified as Ramu (30), Shikha (35), Bhim Singh (54), Urmila (65) and two-year-old Vaishnavi.
