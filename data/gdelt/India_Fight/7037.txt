Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal likens the Pulwama terror incident to the "attacks of Mughals"

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Sunday likened the Pulwama terror incident, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, to the "attacks of Mughals".

The chief minister was addressing a public rally of the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha in Lakhimpur district in presence of BJP President Amit Shah.

Sonowal said, "The recent Kashmir incident is an Islamist terrorist attack on India. Our brave jawans were martyred and I pay my sincere homage to them We have to continue the fight against the Mughals even today. The attack of the Mughals is not over yet and the Kashmir incident is proof of that."

Forty CRPF personnel were killed in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday when a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying explosives into their bus.

The CRPF convoy comprising nearly 70 vehicles was moving from its last transient point in Qazigund where it arrived after leaving Jammu.
