IAF Jet Shoots Down Pakistani Military Drone Near Indo-Pak Border

A fighter jet of the Indian Air Force on Monday shot down a Pakistani military drone in Bikaner sector of the Indo-Pak border using an air-to-air missile, government sources said.

The Pakistani drone was shot down by a Sukhoi-30 aircraft at around 11:30 am, minutes after a ground-based radar station detected the flying machine, they said.

It was the second unsuccessful attempt by Pakistan to send a spy drone inside India in the last six days.

The radar station in the Bikaner sector detected the enemy drone following which a fighter jet was deployed, government sources said.

The downing of the jet came in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan after IAF struck a terrorist training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot and subsequent retaliation by Islamabad.

A Pakistani drone was shot down by India on February 27 along Indo-Pak border in Kutch in Gujarat.
