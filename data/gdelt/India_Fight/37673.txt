"Kashmir and Jammu division will be separate Union Territory with legislature," Amit Shah told the Rajya Sabha on Monday as he announced creation of Union Territory of Ladakh.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah has moved a bill in the Rajya Sabha to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

Making the announcement in Rajya Sabha, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the UT in Ladakh will have no legislature like Chandigarh while the other UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have a legislature like Delhi and Puducherry.

"Kashmir and Jammu division will be separate Union Territory with legislature," Amit Shah told the Rajya Sabha on Monday as he announced creation of Union Territory of Ladakh.

As Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation bill, chaotic scenes were seen in the House soon after the announcement of the Home Minister.

"There has been a long pending demand of people of Ladakh, to give it the status of a Union Territory to enable them to realise their aspirations. The Union Territory of Ladakh will be without Legislature," the statement read.
