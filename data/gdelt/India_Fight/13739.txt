Odisha: Farmer outfit to pass resolution not to allow EVM machines in villages

BHUBANESWAR: Farmer outfit, Navnirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS), will pass a resolution to boycott election and not to allow electronic voting machines (EVMs) into villages protesting the state and Centre’s indifferent attitude in addressing farmer issues in Odisha.NKS national convener Akshaya Kumar said neither the state nor the Centre fulfilled their demands including pension to farmers and proper price to agricultural produces. “Both the Centre and the state announced to provide monetary help to farmers ahead of the general elections . But it is a temporary relief and cannot solve the agrarian distress in rural areas,” he added.He said the state used police against the farmers when they tried to raise voice against the government. “As they (the government) did not allow us to enter into the capital city three times, we will also give befitting reply when the politicians visit villages. Even we will not allow the entry of EVMs into the villages as a mark of our protest,” he added.The outfit will hold a state working committee meeting on March 13 and 14 and discuss its next course of actions ahead of elections. It will pass a resolution to boycott elections and not to allow entry of EVMs in village booths. The resolution will be sent to the President, the Election Commission of India (ECI) and governor of Odisha.Kumar said they will also hold a padyatra for around 20 days to mobilize the farmers across the state on the issue. “We will conduct meetings in villages and pass resolution not to cooperate in the election process. We are not afraid of arrests or police excess. But we make it clear that protests will be conducted peacefully and in a non-violent way,” he added.
