Roshan Mathew is racing ahead

The actor to play the lead in Anurag Kashyap’s movie

Roshan Mathew is moving on. The actor began shooting in Mumbai on Thursday in Anurag Kashyap’s latest film. Social media got to know about this when film director Geethu Mohandas posted the news on her Facebook page.

An ecstatic Geethu wrote on Wednesday: “When I was filming Moothon, I got close to all my actors, rooting for them and wanting the best to happen in their lives always. That ‘want’ will be forever. I’m so proud to announce that my actor and good friend Roshan Mathew, with his unbelievable performance in Moothon, has landed himself a beautiful project as the lead in none other than the maverick filmmaker #Anurag Kashyap’s latest. The shoot commences tomorrow in Bombay. I wish you the world Roshan. This is just the... beginning.” She signed off as ‘from your proud director’.

After his debut in Puthiya Niyamam, a Mammootty-Nayantara-starrer directed by A K Sajan, Roshan was noticed in Ganesh Raj’s Aanandam and Anjali Menon’s Koode. His performance in Thottappan, currently in theatres, has come in for praise. In the meantime, Roshan has been busy as a theatreperson with his play A Very Normal Family.

The actor has a plum role in Moothon, which Geethu says in her post, will “release soon.”
