US embassy looking into reports that Pakistan F-16s were used to shoot down Indian jet

The United States Embassy in Islamabad is looking into reports that Pakistan used U.S.-built F-16 jets to shoot down an Indian warplane, a spokesperson for the embassy said Sunday.

“We are aware of these reports and are seeking more information,” the spokesperson said, according to Reuters. “We take all allegations of misuse of defense articles very seriously.”

Using the F-16 jets to shoot down an Indian warplane would potentially be a violation of U.S. agreements, according to Reuters.

The reports come after Pakistan and India last week exchanged multiple airstrikes.

India on Tuesday ordered an airstrike over the disputed Kashmir region, targeting the Jaish-e-Mohammed group of fighters. That airstrike came in response to a car bombing in February that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir.

On Wednesday, Pakistan and India each said they had shot down each other's warplanes and Pakistan captured an Indian pilot. Pakistan later returned the pilot to India, and tensions between the countries appeared to deescalate.

A spokesperson for Pakistan's military denied that Pakistan used F-16 jets in shooting down India's warplane. But the spokesperson did not say which planes Pakistan did use.
