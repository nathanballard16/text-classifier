Tension prevails on the Benaras Hindu University (BHU) campus after three motorcyclists shot at a 23-year-old student outside the Birla hostel gate on Tuesday night. Later, he succumbed to his injuries at BHU’s Institute of Medical Sciences.

According to police sources, a case has been registered against the BHU chief proctor and four others for the conspiracy to murder the student. The four have been detained for interrogation.

Gaurav Singh was earlier pursuing his MCA. The son of a BHU employee, he was an accused in the 2017 campus violence and had been jailed in 2018. He had since been expelled.

According to eyewitnesses, the three assailants on a motorcycle opened fire at Gaurav, who received injuries in stomach and chest. He was rushed to the hospital where he later died.

Police sources say the killing was a result of the personal enmity related to student politics.

Following the incident, Varanasi DM Surendra Singh and SSP Sureshrao A Kulkarni rushed to the campus and summoned police force from 16 neighbouring police stations as the agitated students went on the rampage at the trauma centre where Gaurav had been admitted.

In view of the tension on the campus, the district police quietly conducted the post-mortem and sent the body to his native village in Rohania in Varanasi for last rites.
