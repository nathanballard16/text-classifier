Generally, the month of December marks the end of Cyclone season in the Indian Seas. In fact, the last Cyclone observed in the Bay of Bengal was Phethai that mainly affected the eastern states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. However, as disturbances keep occurring, possibility for the formation of cyclonic storm in the month of January remain bleak.

Now also, we can see the formation of a similar situation, a cyclonic storm named Usman has already lashed the Philippines region during the New Year weekend and the central parts of the country were most affected.

Fifty-seven people died in the mountainous Bicol region, southeast of Manila, while 11 were killed in the central island of Samar. Moreover, the storm caused floods and loosened the soil, triggering landslides in some areas.

At present, the cyclonic storm lies in South China Sea. However, the storm is now weakening and with its westward movement is entering Gulf of Thailand. It will continue to move in west direction across Malaysia and adjoining region of Myanmar. It is expected to entre extreme southeastern parts of Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea around January 5.

Thus, we can say that around January 5 and 6, the Bay Islands i.e. Car Nicobar, Long Island, Port Blair are likely to experience squally winds accompanied with heavy rainfall activity. However, due to its weakening and recurving nature, this storm will not go beyond Andaman Sea. It will certainly not be affecting the mainland of India.
