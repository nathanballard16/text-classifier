NEW DELHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed and six others injured after a speeding train ran them down Monday in northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, police said.

The accident took place at Balrai railway station in Etawah district, about 260 km west of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.

"Today four people were killed and six injured, after being run over by the Rajdhani Express here," a police official posted in Etawah told Xinhua. "The victims were travelling onboard Avadh Express to Surat but their train halted at Balrai railway station to give pass to Kanpur-New Delhi Rajdhani Express. The four passengers had de-boarded the train and were standing near the tracks when they were run over by the train."

The injured were immediately removed to the nearest hospital. Reports said the sight of blood soaked bodies on the railway tracks triggered panic among the bystanders and passengers.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed grief over the deaths and ordered authorities to provide treatment to the injured in the accident.

The Indian government in 2015 announced an investment of over 137 billion U.S. dollars over a period of next five years to boost railways and modernise it on new lines.

Indian sprawling railways is the world's third largest network, ferrying around 23 million people each day.
