Akshay Kumar reignites Laxmmi Bomb

Akshay Kumar and the unit of Raghava Lawrence’s film Laxmmi Bomb finally resumed shooting after the differences between the producers — Shabinaa Khan, Tusshar Kapoor and Lawrence — were sorted out.

Earlier, Lawrence had walked out of the project after the makers released the film’s poster without his clearance, and Akshay mediated to set things right. “Yes, it was Akshay sir who was there coordinating and making sure that the project was made. The film is a remake of Muni 2: Kanchana,” said Lawrence.

Made in 2011, Muni 2 is the sequel to Muni, which was made in 2007. Akshay is slated to play a transgender in the film — a role that Sharathkumar played in Muni 2. However, the role may have changed in the Hindi remake. While a source close to the film reveals that the changes in the story are being kept under wraps, we hear that a transgender ghost will possess Akshay’s character in the Hindi remake.

The first schedule of the film was shot in April in Mumbai. While the second schedule was to take place in July, and has begun in Mumbai’s Madh Island.
