Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi launched a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a crackdown on students protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Addressing a Congress party dharna at Rajghat on Monday, he said that the Modi government cannot silence the voice of students by using lathi and bullets against them.

"When you (Narendra Modi) lathicharge students and fire upon them, then you attempt to silence the voice of this country," he alleged. The entire top Congress leadership, led by party chief Sonia Gandhi, sat on a 'Satyagraha for Unity' at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial - Rajghat, demanding protection of the rights of people as enshrined in the Constitution.

At the end of the four and half hour long sit-in protest, Rahul said that the Preamble of the Constitution read out by leaders at the dharna is the voice of people of India. "It is this voice that fought against the British and forced them to leave India through peaceful agitation. The enemies of India tried their best to suppress this voice but failed," he said.

Talking about the state of the economy, he said that Narendra Modi must answer to the nation why the growth rate which used to be 9 per cent has fallen to 4 per cent. "You couldn't give jobs and derailed the economy that's why you are spreading hatred and trying to divide this country," he alleged.

After reading out the preamble in Hindi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in the names of all those "martyred" during the anti-CAA protests, her party resolved to protect the Constitution.

"In the name of Bijnor's 22-year-old Anas, who used to earn money for his family through a coffee-vending machine and had recently gotten married. In the name of 21-year-old Suleiman, who was studying for the UPSC exam and used to take tuition," she said.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath asserted that their governments will not implement the CAA.

Top Congress leaders, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mallikarjun Kharge, Anand Sharma, Digvijaya Singh, Mukul Wasnik, KC Venugopal, besides CWC members, AICC general secretaries and the party's state in-charges took part in the 'Satyagraha'.
