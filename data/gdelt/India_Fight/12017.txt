India handed over Pakistani prisoner, stoned to death in Indian jail

F.P. Report

KARACHI: Indian authorities on Saturday handed over the body of the Pakistani prisoner, Shakirullah who was stoned to death by other inmates in Rajasthan’s Jaipur Central Jail on 20 February.

According to details, the prisoners in Jaipur jail had murdered the Pakistani inmate after India has leveled baseless allegations against Pakistan of being involved in the Pulwama attack in occupied Kashmir. Shakirullah had been in the Indian jail since 2001.

Islamabad had lodged its protest with India after the inspector general of police (IG) for Rajasthan and in-charge of prisons Kapil Garg confirmed the news of Shakirullah’s murder on February 20.

The Pakistani prisoner had been eight years into a life term when he was attacked at the Jaipur central jail. He was stoned to death following a quarrel, Garg told international media outlet.

Earlier on Friday, Pakistan had handed over Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman to Indian authorities at the Wagah border crossing as a “peace gesture” to de-escalate the rising tensions between the two South Asian neighboring countries.

Abhinandan was captured when his MiG-21 among two Indian military aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force after they ventured into the Pakistani airspace.
