Please spare us, urge Army veterans

Hyderabad: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath referring to the Indian Army as Modi’s Sena has “upset” officials in the army with veterans asking political parties to spare the forces in the election battle.

One has even said using the Army for political gains is “shameful’.

The Army can only be referred to in the Indian Constitution, they have emphasised adding that forces are “independent and apolitical”.

Strongly objecting to Mr Adityanath’s speech, former Navy Chief and Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas wrote to the Election Commission saying that the Indian Army did not belong to any individual and cited possible violation of the election code of conduct.

Lieutenant General Mohan Bandari (retired) said , “When I joined the service 50 years ago, we were told then and even now that the Army is an apolitical institution, reason being very clear ‘whoever is their master (Army chief), is their boss. The Indian Army imbibed its customs and traditions from the British and we follow it till date. The Army is not concerned with the government or the party ruling it.

This apart, there are committees that work on the nation’s security and whatever decision is taken, the Army obeys it. Using the Army for political gains is shameful.” Not too long ago, political parties used the face of Wing Commandar Abhinandan Varthaman in their political rallies. The EC then issued notices advising that the army be kept out of this.

“The Armed forces are loyal to the Constitution of India and the President. The Prime Minister has no formal role, it is the President who is their supreme commander. It is he who commissions the officers. Misusing the Army for political benefits will damage the country’s independent institutions. It is highly condemnable,” added military analyst Mr Mandeep singh Bajwa.
