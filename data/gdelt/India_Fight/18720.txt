After a day lull in cross-LoC skirmishes, an army major and two civilians were injured as the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged fresh shelling and firing in Dagwar sector in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.

A police officer said that Pakistan army initiated the “unprovoked ceasefire” violation by firing mortar shells and small arms on forward posts and villages along the LoC in Dagwar.

The troops manning the fence responded strongly which resulted in a heavy exchange of cross-LoC shelling in these areas, he said.

An army officer was injured in the incident, he said. Two civilians including a woman were also injured after some shells landed in the residential area.

The injured were identified as Kamal Din son of Alam Din and Naseem Akther wife of Mohd Kadir of Nakerkote. The injured were taken to district hospital Poonch for treatment.

Chief Medical Officer Poonch Dr Mumtaz Bhatti told news agency GNS that after being operated in the district hospital, one of the injured Kamal Din was later referred to GMC Jammu for advanced treatment.

Four domestic animals also died in the shelling, said a local resident.

The exchange of cross-LoC shelling was going on in the area when this report was filed.

Meanwhile, as a precautionary measure, the government has ordered the closure of private and government schools located in 0-5 km range from LoC in Poonch district tomorrow (Friday).
