Itâ€™s Goddess Kamakhyaâ€™s order! Tantrik seeks Bihar govtâ€™s permission for human sacrifice

New Delhi:

In a bizarre incident, a tantrik from Bihar’s Begusarai has written to local authorities seeking permission for human sacrifice for his occult ritual. According to a Press Trust of India report, the man identified Surendra Prasad Singh aka Pagla Baba sent an application to Sub Divisional Officer (Sadar), Begusarai on January 29 last month. The tantrik claims that Goddess Kamakhya ordered him to sacrifice his son!

According to Singh, his son, who is an engineer by profession, never gives money to his temple. “He is like Ravana,” Singh wrote in a letter that has gone viral now. Meanwhile, SDO Sanjiv Kumar Chaudhary has said that he has not received such letter. “This is a serious matter. Human sacrifice is illegal. We have launched a hunt for the letter as well as the tantrik. Appropriate action will be taken," Singh was quoted as saying by PTI.

On December 26, 2018, a 30-year-old had killed his mother-in-law and drank her blood in a Jharkhand village. The accused was identified as Fhalindra Lohra. According to The Hindustan Times report, Lohra confessed about practicing witchcraft. He murdered his mother-in-law for a ritual, which would help his gaining mastery over black magic. Lohra visited his wife's home on Monday, where he killed his mother-in-law. When his father-in-law discovered the body, Lohra tried to flee, but he was caught by another relative.

According to local police, a body of a buffalo calf and a duck were also found from the house in Ranchi's Rangamati village.

Black magic or suspicion of black magic has been reason behind many crimes, especially in rural India. Recently, a 30-year-old man had murdered his mother because he suspected that she was 'doing black magic on him.' According to news agency ANI, the incident took place on December 23 in a village in Telangana. Boinpalle Police of Rajanna Sircilla District said that, "On December 23, a person by the name of Srinivas, killed his mother by strangulating her to death. He suspected that his mother practiced black magic on him, from which he was falling ill often. So the accused decided to murder his 52-year-old mother at her residence." The man has been booked under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.

But it was the Burari case in the National Capital that rocked the nation. In this case, 11 members of a family allegedly committed suicide. Many reports suggested that the Chandawat family of Delhi's Burari area were under some influence and they were preforming some black magic ritual. However, the probe by the Delhi Police has pointed out the ritual gone wrong theory. According to the police, the family members never intended to end their lives. They were performing a ritual also known as 'badh pooja', in which, members tied themselves with the iron mesh in the house. But it was not a mass suicide. The probe has also ruled out any foul play or the theory that Lalit, one of the sons, killed everyone and then committed suicide.
