Rohit Shukla murder: AU expels 5 students

Allahabad University (AU) has expelled five students, including four accused in the murder of former Allahabad University student Rohit Shukla, who was shot dead at PC Banerjee hostel on April 15.

AU proctor Prof Ram Sewak Dubey and dean student welfare (DSW) Prof Harsh Kumar have sent notices to all the five students, giving them a deadline of 15 days to be present in the proctor’s office and submit a written explanation, failing which the college will cancel their graduation degrees, said an official.

The notices have been issued to MA final year (Hindi) student Saurabh Vishwakarma, BSc first year student Prashant Upadhyay, MA final year (Hindi) student Adarsh Kumar, MA Ancient History final year student Abhishek Yadav along with PC Banerjee hostel’s room number 235’s occupant and a third year LLB student Ashutosh Kumar Shahi.

Ashutosh was allotted room number 235 of PC Banerjee hostel, in which the bomb making materials like gun powder etc were found in police raids after the murder. The notice said these students violated the hostel rules and also marred the image of Allahabad University.

While Prashant has been arrested, the other four are still at large.
