Yasin Malik: Government bans Yasin’s JKLF, blames it for 1989 genocide of Pandits

Govt bans Yasin Malik led JKLF under anti-terror law

NEW DELHI: Continuing its crackdown on separatist elements in Jammu & Kashmir, the government on Friday banned the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) led by Yasin Malik as an unlawful association for its extremist orientation and violence against the Hindu minority in the Valley.The ban under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act is on the grounds that JKLF had spearheaded separatist ideology in Kashmir and triggered the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits by murdering members of the minority community in the late eighties.“Malik was the mastermind behind the purging of Kashmiri Pandits and is responsible for their genocide. The JKLF has many serious cases registered against it. This organisation is responsible for murder of four IAF personnel and kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of the then Union home minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed in the V P Singh government,” home secretary Union Rajiv Gauba said.JKLF(Y) is the second Kashmir organisation to be banned under UAPA in the past one month after Jamaat-e-Islami (J&K), linked to Hizbul Mujahideen.The action against JKLF(Y) serves to underline that a political solution in Jammu & Kashmir will not involve separatists. It coincided with the Pakistan high commission here extending an invite to the separatist leaders for Pakistan national day celebrations and the government’s decision to boycott the event. With election campaigning picking up steam, no initiative can be expected till the next government assumes office with BJP making national security and Pakistan’s support to terrorism a central part of its campaign.Home secretary Rajiv Gauba said on Friday that the Centre is following a policy of “zero tolerance” against terrorism and is committed to relentlessly curbing activities of secessionist organisations. NIA and the Enforcement Directorate are taking strong action against these organisations, he said.“The organisation has been actively and continuously encouraging feelings of enmity and hatred against lawfully established government, as well as armed rebellion,” a home ministry statement said, adding that 37 FIRs had been registered by J&K Police against the outfit.Intelligence sources told TOI that Malik is the only separatist leader apart from Tehreek-e-Hurriyat boss Syed Ali Shah Geelani to have a dedicated set of leaders and cadres to mobilise stone-pelting mobs at short notice. While Geelani’s team has been rounded up as part of the terror-funding case investigated by NIA, Malik continued to have the wherewithal to organise stone-pelting at the ISI’s behest.While JKLF’s original charter of demand was to carve out a separate and independent state of Kashmir comprising both PoK and Kashmir Valley, Malik has for long been patronised by Pakistan and its spy agency ISI.Malik is believed to have also struck a deal with Lashkar-e-Taiba, having made peace with its boss Hafiz Saeed after the latter suspected his role in the murder of Maulana Showkat of Ahl-e-Hadith sect in Srinagar in 2011. In 2013, when Malik had travelled to Pakistan for “talks” with Hafiz Saeed, he came on the radar of Indian intelligence agencies for sharing the stage with Saeed in Islamabad at funeral prayers for hanged Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzal Guru.JKLF, the MHA said on Friday, was actively involved in raising funds and its distribution to Hurriyat cadres and stone-pelters to fuel unrest in Kashmir Valley as well as for subversive activities.The ban on JKLF(Y) comes a month after Malik was detained by J&K Police under the Public Safety Act. He was later shifted from a Srinagar prison to Kot Balwal Jail in Jammu. The CBI, meanwhile, also filed a transfer application in the Jammu & Kashmir high court to reopen 30-year-old cases against Malik.These cases include the killing of four unarmed Indian Air Force officers in January 1990 in Srinagar and also the kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of then Union home minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed under the V P Singh government. As many as five terrorists were freed, as demanded by JKLF, to secure the release of Rubaiya.Malik is also an accused in the killing of Justice Neelkanth Ganju, the judge who had given the death sentence to JKLF terrorist Maqbool Bhat.
