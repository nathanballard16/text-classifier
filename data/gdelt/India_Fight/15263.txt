The more things change, the more they seem to remain the same when it comes to the Medical Council of India (MCI). In May 2010 the UPA government dissolved the MCI and constituted a Board of Governors (BoG) to run the council while a new law was to replace the council. Government changed. The law never happened and MCI came back. Almost a decade later, a new government again dissolved the MCI and constituted a BoG which has a tenure of two years according to the latest ordinance promulgated on February 21, 2019. The government’s term is over and the law to replace MCI is nowhere in sight, despite it being a majority government. The saga of cleansing medical education in India goes on.

Here is a look at the governments vs MCI battle over the years

However, a year later, the Bill had not been cleared by the cabinet and hence the term of the BoG was extended
