Two shop owners on FC Road booked for selling fake goods

A quality control official of Nike had filed an FIR; Deccan police seize fake shoes and clothing worth Rs 5.23 lakh



The Deccan police have taken action against two shops located on Fergusson College road for selling fake goods in the name of branded goods to its customers. An FIR was lodged by a resident of Mumbai after she noticed that the businesses were running a fake goods racket.



According to police officials, Ashwini Madhav Nijsure, 36, a resident of Mumbai, had lodged an FIR against the two shop owners from FC Road.



The two shops, Cowboy Shoes and Phantom Shoes, are located in one of the commercial buildings near Garware circle.



The complainant is a brand protection manager with Legist IPR Services Ltd and an official representative working quality control at Nike. Nijsure said in her statement, “The two shops have been illegally using the name of the company and selling goods. ”



She cited that this maligns the image of the company in the market as the fake products have much lower standards of quality as compared to original ones.



Apolice official from Deccan police station said, “Sumit Yashwant Salunkhe, 25, and Kiran Kamlakar Kshirsagar, 35, have been booked in this case. ”



Deccan police also seized a plethora of these fake goods after they raided the shops on Tuesday. A total of 915 pairs of shoes and about 50 clothing pieces branded with Nike and Adidas logos were seized by the cops from both the shops. The cost of these seizures amounts to about Rs 5.23 lakh.



While confirming the raids, senior police inspector Bhaskar Jadhav from Deccan police station, said, “We immediately took action after the complaint and arrested both the shop owners .”



The accused have been booked under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for cheating. Along with the IPC section, stringent sections of the Copyright Act and the Trademark Act have also been invoked against the two.
