'Hard man' who used martial arts to murder Mother Teresa's former assistant is jailed for life

A martial arts expert has been jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years for killing a former assistant to Mother Teresa following a pub row.

Colin Payne, 61, was found guilty of murdering Mark Bloomfield, 54, after "viciously" punching him outside the Full Moon pub in Swansea.

On Thursday, Swansea Crown Court heard "self-styled hard man" Payne launched his attack on the charity worker to "teach him a lesson" after he had brushed his girlfriend's back with a beer can on July 18 this year.

Payne dragged Mr Bloomfield to the floor by his throat and kicked him in his head, before taking the attack outside and punching "two expert blows" to his head.

Mr Bloomfield was knocked to the ground after hitting his head on the concrete, never to regain consciousness, and died in hospital two days later.
