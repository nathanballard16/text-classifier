IndusLaw ramps up corporate with JSA’s Revathy Muralidharan • Opens new Bombay HC office

Revathy Muralidharan joins Indus as corporate partner

IndusLaw has hired J Sagar Associates (JSA) principal associate Revathy Muralidharan as a corporate transactional partner in Mumbai, as well as opened a new Mumbai litigation office near the high court.

She specialises in M&A and private equity work, as well as general corporate work, including employment and compliance.

The 2009 Dr Ambedkar Law University School of Excellence in Law graduate had begun her career at Trilegal Bangalore, moved to HSB Partners in Chennai in 2011 and went independent at the Madras high court in 2013.

In 2014, she had joined JSA in Chennai as a senior associate, moving to its Gurgaon office in 2017.

IndusLaw senior partner Suneeth Katarki added in the release: “It is nice to welcome young partners who have energy and enthusiasm along with technical abilities.

“We have almost always found that their contribution to the Firm exceeds expectations and I am sure that will be true here as well.”

With her joining, IndusLaw is now 36 partners strong.

Muralidharan commented: “I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to be a part of one of India’s fastest growing top tier law firm.”

New Mumbai HC office

After its recent move into a larger office on the 15th floor of One Indiabulls Centre in Lower Parel, IndusLaw has also opened a new office in South Mumbai’s Fort area, to be closer to the high court.

The firm will have three litigation partners and their team based from there, which will most certainly reduce their traffic woes between office and high court hearings.

IndusLaw litigation partner Amit Jajoo commented in a press release: “To effectively handle litigation and allow the growing litigation practice, time management and efficiency, we have branched out a new office around the High Court.”
