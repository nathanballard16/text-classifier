LS polls: Prakash Raj pays visit to Dargah ahead of filing nomination

Actor turned politician Prakash Raj on Friday visited Ali Shah Dargah and offered prayers before filing his nominations papers for the upcoming Lok Sabha election.

Raj has in January announced that he will not join any political party and will contest the Lok Sabha polls from Bengaluru Central as an Independent. He will contest poll against BJP's PC Mohan, who has held Bengaluru Central seat since 2009.

Raj is known for his anti-BJP stance and has been very vocal in seeking justice for journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead outside her residence.

Karnataka will vote to elect its members of Parliament during the second and third phases of polling on April 18 and April 23, respectively. The counting of votes will take place on May 23.
