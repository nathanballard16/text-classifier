UP BJP MLA Protest: BJP MLAs protest against own government in Uttar Pradesh assembly

LUCKNOW: In a rare development, the inaugural day of the winter session of the Uttar Pradesh assembly on Tuesday saw nearly 100 BJP MLAs staging a dharna in the House, shouting slogans against their own government in open defiance of senior ministers who tried to persuade them to give up the unprecedented protest.The MLAs called off their agitation after four hours following the intervention of Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit, who promised to take up their grievances with CM Yogi Adityanath who was away campaigning in Jharkhand.It was a huge embarrassment and opposition Samajwadi Party MLAs rubbed it in by joining their BJP rivals in a gesture of "solidarity".Sources said the matter has been brought to the notice of of BJP's central leadership and there were indications that party’s working president J P Nadda had sought a report from the state unit. Adityanath, who was briefed about the embarrassing development on his return, was also learnt to have held talks with senior colleagues. The trigger for the unusual spectacle came from BJP MLA from Loni, Nand Kishore Gujjar, who was upset for being denied the opportunity to raise the issue of "fake" cases foisted on him by UP police.Seeing the mood of the BJP MLAs, SP MLAs too trooped to the floor of the House and raised slogans like “vidhayak ekta zindabad” and demanded protection for the aggrieved MLA.“It is unfortunate that even MLAs of the ruling party in power are not safe and satisfied,” leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said.Amid the pandemonium in the House, Dixit hurriedly adjourned the House around 2 pm until Wednesday. However, the agitated MLAs, both from BJP and opposition, continued to squat on the floor of the House or sat on their benches.Repeated attempts by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna to pacify Gujjar and other MLAs proved futile as they continued their protest from their benches despite the House being adjourned.This is first time in the history of the state when MLAs of the ruling party have staged a demonstration in the House, demanded protection from police and blamed their own government for not reining in bureaucracy and police.“Hamari koi sunwai nahi hai (our voices are not heard),” said most of the MLAs.After a failed attempt by Khanna, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma made an attempt to talk about the issue with the protesting MLAs,but to little avail.It was only when the Speaker called some of the disgruntled MLAs to his chamber that they relented and agree to talk. “Some MLAs had some issues to raise. I have given them a hearing,” said Dixit.As soon as Adityanath left the House for campaigning in Jharkhand, the MLAs grouped together and began raising their hands in the House, shouting slogans against the police and demanded action against “erring” officials.Gujjar has been sulking for about a fortnight since an FIR was lodged by the local police against him and his supporters following his tussle with a local food inspector over licences for meat shops.Sources said the FIR was lodged by the food inspector after a verbal duel with the MLA. The MLA, it is said, approached the CM to protest against the government functionary but failed to get the FIR dropped.Following this, Gujjar wrote a detailed letter to Yogi, stating that he was not feeling safe and that the CM should get him booked for heinous offences so that he got jailed as he did not feel safe.The party treated this an act of indiscipline and sought an explanation from the MLA.The situation took an ugly turn when Gujjar was, sources claim to claimed, fired at by some unknown persons while returning from Meerut recently. The MLA claimed he had survived but the windscreen of his car was smashed. While the police lodged an FIR against two unknown bike-borne persons, Gujjar remained unsatisfied and is believed to have lobbied party MLAs to support him.Seeing the mood of the BJP MLAs, SP MLAs too trooped to the floor of the house and raised slogans like “vidhayak ekta zindabad” and demanded protection for the aggrieved MLA.“It is unfortunate that even MLAs of the party in power were not safe and satisfied,” said leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary.Amidst the pandemonium in the House, Dixit hurriedly adjourned the House around 2 pm until Wednesday.
