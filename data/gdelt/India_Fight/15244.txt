Lok Sabha elections: Will Priyanka pull off what Rahul Gandhi couldn't in 2017 poll?

LUCKNOW: There are striking similarities between Congress president Rahul Gandhi 's 2,500km 'Deoria to Dilli' kisan yatra in 2017 before UP assembly elections, when he held 'khat sabhas' with rural people and the scheduled 'Ganga Yatra' of the debutant Congress general secretary and sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Will Priyanka's three-day poll blitz from March 18 from Allahabad, once a Congress citadel, to Varanasi, the holiest Hindu town and now famous as the PM Modi's seat, invigorate a moribund party or end up in same manner as her brother's Kisan Yatra?The grand old party nosedived to a record low of just seven MLAs in the last Assembly polls after Rahul's yatra. During his Kisan Yatra, Rahul covered most parts of the state on bike, boat and four-wheelers and drew crowds, curiosity and media attention.Priyanka's proposed Ganga Yatra is already drawing attention of even the international media and political observers. Priyanka would be first politician of stature who will venture out for a unique election campaign through the river route and is likely to cover a dozen Lok Sabha constituencies and directly reach out to the poorest of the poor along the river banks.The camp followers of PGV are already reminding people how Indira after being dislodged from power in 1977 by the Janata Party government had undertaken the famous 'Belchi' yatra in Bihar where due to heavy rains, the marooned and slushy roads had turned unmotorable.So, in the dead of night, she took an elephant ride to reach out to bereaved Dalit families whose kin were been killed in a massacre. Indira drew sympathies from her yatra and she led the Congress to recapture power in Delhi in 1980. During her three-day Ganga voyage, Priyanka also intends to meet Dalits and the most backwards whose livelihood depends on meagre earnings from fishing and farming along the banks.Priyanka is sounding spirited and aggressive and that's why she decided to make an unscheduled visit to an ailing Bhim Sena chief Chandrashekhar and then storm the state by taking on Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi. In her debut campaign in the state, Priyanka will touch the two favourite subjects of Modi - Ganga and Kashi - in her speeches and is likely to project herself as "Ganga ki beti".
