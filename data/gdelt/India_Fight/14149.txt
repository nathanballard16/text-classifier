It's a known fact that Vikrant Massey, of Lipstick Under My Burkha and A Death In the Gunj fame, would be starring opposite Deepika Padukone in her next big project Chhapaak. Now, in fresh development on the movie, the actor has reportedly shifted to JW Marriott Hotel in Mumbai for the prep of the film.

As per a statement, the 31-year-old actor will start shooting for the Meghna Gulzar directorial in the national capital in the third week of March. For the unversed, Chhapaak is a biographical film based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.

While Deepika would be essaying the lead role, Vikrant would be supporting her character by portraying Alok Dixit, a journalist turned social activist who later went on to marry Laxmi in 2014.

The Dil Dhadakne Do actor is reportedly doing prep in terms of his physical appearance too, which needs a lot to be worked on for the role. He is, however, pretty comfortable with the dialect. The television star turned Bollywood actor reportedly took a month off after wrapping up all his schedules so that he could prepare for the role, which would undoubtedly be one of his biggest roles till date.

The actor, who stepped into Bollywood with the 2013 movie Lootera that had starred Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha, usually takes off to an unknown role for its prep. This time around, however, the actor has shifted base to a hotel. On the film front, Vikrant has as many as five movies and a web show in the making.
