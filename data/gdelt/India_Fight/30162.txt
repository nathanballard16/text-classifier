Srinagar

Chennai based Hindu newspaper exclusively reported that Shujaat had escaped an assassination bid on June 13, 2018, a day before he was actually murdered.

“Pointing to grave lapses on the part of the security apparatus, the investigation into the assassination of journalist and editor of Rising Kashmir Shujaat Bukhari in 2018, has found that the June 14 incident was the second attempt within 24 hours,” Peerzada Ashiq reported in the newspaper.

“One year after the crime, the police investigation suggested that Bukhari was chased by six men on two motorcycles around 7.15 p.m. on June 13, 2018 from Srinagar’s Press Enclave,” the newspaper quoted police sources saying. “The assailants drove very close to the editor’s SUV, crossing the Kothi Bagh Police Station and Polo View.”

According to investigators, newspaper added, the aim was to kill the journalist on the wider stretch of road connecting Polo View with Doordarshan Road. “However, the gunmen failed to pull out their guns as Bukhari’s driver was driving very fast to reach an Iftar organised by a businessman at Hotel Sarovar Portico in Sonawar.”
