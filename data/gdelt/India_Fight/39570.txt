Indian Defence Minister Hints at Possibility of Nuclear Policy Change Amid Tensions with Pakistan

Singh’s comments were seen as a response to Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s recent statement, saying that the “Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end. We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard.”

Current Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also indicated that New Delhi could revisit its nuclear option. During his election campaign in April 2019, Modi told party workers that he would not give in to "Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail."

The current escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan began on 14 February, when 40 Indian soldiers were killed in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, allegedly by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad. India retaliated with air strikes on what it said was a terrorist training camp in Pakistan.

Tensions rose further earlier this month when India stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status. Pakistan insists that it is a stakeholder in Kashmir and that any unilateral decision by India is unacceptable. Islamabad has subsequently scaled back diplomatic ties, blocked rail and road communication and cut trade with India.
