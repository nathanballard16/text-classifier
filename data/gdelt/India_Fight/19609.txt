Why Narendra Modi is no longer certain to win India's mega-election

After India’s 2014 General Election Narendra Modi vowed “Good days are coming”. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had secured a landslide victory, forming the largest majority government since 1984.

Analysts had lauded Mr Modi’s ambitious ‘Development For All’ manifesto.

Throughout a gruelling campaign, which saw the then 64-year-old address over 450 rallies, he promised to transform living standards for every Indian from subsistence farmers in rural Nagaland to technology entrepreneurs in urban Pune.

However, fast forward to 2018 and the BJP suffered regional election defeats in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh – each time to resurgent opposition, the Indian National Congress (INC).

These three ‘Hindu heartland’ provinces are considered good signifiers of how the whole country will vote in this week’s General Election.

Heading into the vote, Mr Modi’s popularity is at an all-time low.

An India Today poll on January 9 found support for the Prime Minister had plummeted from 65% to 46% since January 2017.

So, why has Mr Modi’s re-election gone from inevitable to uncertain?
