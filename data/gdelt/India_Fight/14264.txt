Last year, Irrfan Khan revealed to his fans that he is suffering from cancer. The actor, who had flown to London for the treatment is now back in India and is expected to soon start shooting for the film Hindi Medium 2. The actor was recently spotted at Mumbai airport, but he refused to get clicked.

Now, producer Dinesh Vijan has revealed that he is gearing up for Hindi Medium 2. He told Indian Express, "He (Irrfan Khan) has gotten back. We are just putting the finishing touches to the script. I think it is too early to talk about it. I think in another two months, we will have clarity. But we will like to make it this year. I feel (since) he has come back, let him get comfortable. He is doing lovely. He is back in the city. But any official confirmation about the film will only come in about a month."

When the publication asked whether Pakistani actress Saba Qamar will make an appearance in the film, the producer gave a negative response. According to the producer, it (not casting Pakistani actors) is the least that the film industry can do to support the armed forces of the country. Previously, Vijan had announced that Maddok Films won't be releasing its feature films in Pakistan. The decision was made in the wake of the Pulwama attack.

As far as Hindi Medium 2 is concerned, no official confirmation from the makers suggests that fans might have to wait for the film a little longer. The prequel of the film was directed by Saket Chaudhary and hit screens on May 19, 2017. The film garnered love from the audience and was a success.
