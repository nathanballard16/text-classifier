Modi: Kashmir Autonomy Fed ‘Terrorism and Separatism’

Indian Premier Nahendra Modi defended his ongoing crackdown on Kashmir, and his Monday move to revise the constitution to eliminate Kashmir’s autonomy, saying that all the autonomy ever accomplished was “terrorism and separatism,” and that he believes this will “free” the region.



Muslim-majority Kashmir was, until Monday, guaranteed full autonomy in everything but military and foreign policy. The legal change will allow Hindu settlers to move into the region en masse, and hold state government jobs.



Modi accused Pakistan of using Kashmiri autonomy as a weapon against India, and said locals could expect that infrastructure projects in Kashmir will be greatly expedited by not being autonomous.



Pakistan has been greatly critical of the Kashmir crackdown, and has promised to take the matter to the UN Security Council. It is expected that there will also be legal challenges within India on the constitution change, though a communications blackout has much of Kashmir unaware what is happening at this point.
