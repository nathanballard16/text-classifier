'Air Force was unfairly criticised'

NEW DELHI: Grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to face a collusive Pakistan-China threat, the IAF on Thursday heaved a sigh of relief that it will now be able to induct the 36 Rafales without controversy dogging the omni-role jets.After the SC ruling, top serving and retired IAF officers said politics should not be played with critical defence acquisitions because it only ends up jeopardising the country's military preparedness."Our (IAF's) stand has been vindicated. The price negotiations (contract negotiations committee) with France were headed by the then deputy chief who is now the IAF chief (Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria). The deal was clean," Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa (retd) told TOI .ACM Dhanoa, who retired as the IAF chief on September 30, said the apex court's judgment will also have a positive impact on the overall military procurement in the backdrop of controversies often delaying and derailing defence deals in India.The former IAF chief recalled he and his force had been needlessly criticised because they had simply defended the September 2016 contract. "We were told we were making political statements. But we were clear the deal was above board and good, both in terms of cost and capabilities. The Rafale is an excellent aircraft. We are happy the controversy has finally been buried. Political controversies should not be raked up against desperately-needed defence acquisitions," he said .Defence minister Rajnath Singh , in turn, said, "The purchase of Rafale jets was done in a completely transparent manner, keeping in mind the urgency to update and upgrade India's defence preparedness. Issues pertaining to defence preparedness and national security should never be politicised."The IAF brass contends the Rafale fighter will prove a "gamechanger" in air combat capabilities in the re- gion because it could out- gun any combat jet that China or Pakistan can deploy against India at present.Welcoming the SC ruling, the defence ministry said it "brings to a close an exercise of vilification and casting doubts on the defence acquisition process which has an adverse impact on the morale of the Security Forces."The first Rafale, which was handed over to India in France on October 8, incidentally, has the tail number "RB-001" to mark the role played by ACM Bhadauria in finalising the 36-fighter deal.
