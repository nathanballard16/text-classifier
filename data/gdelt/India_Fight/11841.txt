Patna: A recent instance from Araria district has raised serious questions about the state of law and order in Bihar. A police investigation is underway into the alleged burglary attempt at the residence of additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) Shashidhar Vishwakarma. Vishwakarma also holds the position of a special judge (excise).

Going by reports, as many as six armed men managed to sneak into the judge's residence in Araria's G block area in the wee hours of Friday. The miscreants were spotted by security guards who raised an alarm prompting the culprits to flee the spot. However, one of them hid on the residence terrace and was later apprehended and handed over to the police. Several members of the legal community along with the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police reached the scene to inquire about the well being of the judge.

Latest developments suggest that a first information report (FIR) has been lodged in this regard with Araria police. However, protocol officer at the Civil court in Araria, Shyam Bihari Singh told Hindustan Times that his suspicion has led him to believe that the miscreants had broken into the residence to try and murder the judge and not burgle the home.

Speaking to the national daily, Araria sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) KD Singh said that the arrested miscreant seems to be "mentally unstable". He added that prima facie, this looks like a case of attempted burglary. However, Singh clarified that all probable angles are being investigated in this regard.
