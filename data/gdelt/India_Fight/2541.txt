3-member gang attacks tailor

Coimbatore: A three-member gang stabbed a 21-year-old tailor over a previous enmity at Ashok Nagar in Selvapuram on Saturday night.

M Bharathi Kannan of Ashok Nagar at Selvapuram suffered 13 injuries and was admitted in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), police sources said. “One-and-a-half-year ago, he had a fight with Kathirvel of Ashok Nagar during a temple festival over a dance programme. Bharathi Kannan was on the way to his home when a three-member gang on a motorcycle attacked him using a knife on Saturday. Local residents rescued him,” a police officer said.

Bharathi Kannan told Selvapuram police that Kathirvel and his two friends attacked him. Police registered a case against the trio under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested Praveenkumar of Ashok Nagar, a labourer.

Kathirvel and Gowtham are absconding. A special team has been formed to nab the duo.
