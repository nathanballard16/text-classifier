Rohtak, March 16

A team of government officials led by Puneet Sharma, state coordinator of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan, raided a house in Sector 2 of Rohtak and rescued a teenaged boy from Jharkhand. The boy was working as a domestic help in the house.

The team comprised of Narender Kumar, District Child Protection Officer; Neelam Ahuja, member of the Child Welfare Committee; Rajesh from Childline and Sajjan from the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit.

Narender Kumar said a resident had called up on the Childline number and informed them about the issue, following which a raiding party was constituted.

“On reaching the house, we found a teenaged boy working as a domestic help. His employers were not present in the house at that time, so we took the boy and sent him to a child care institute. A case has been registered,” he said.

The official said that it could be a case of child-trafficking and the persons running the Delhi-based placement agency through which the boy was employed in the house would also be questioned.

He said two minor boys, who were working at business establishments in Sampla township of the district, were also rescued by the team on Saturday. “One of the boys was working at a motorcycle repair shop while the other was employed at a general store,” the official said, adding that they had been handed over to their parents and a case registered in this regard.
