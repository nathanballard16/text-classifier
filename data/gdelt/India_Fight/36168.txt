Pakistan can only fight proxy wars with India: Rajnath Singh

By Express News Service

NEW DELHI: After losing every war with India, Pakistan cannot fight conventional wars and therefore, has been resorting to proxy wars, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh while speaking in the Lok Sabha on Friday on the 20th anniversary of the Kargil War. “We fought wars with Pakistan in 1965, 1971 and also in 1999. The amazing way our brave soldiers fought in these wars, I can say with confidence that Pakistan can neither fight a full-fledged war nor even a limited war with India. Pakistan now fights only proxy war,” Singh said.

In 1999, Pakistan Army regulars in the garb of intruders had surreptitiously occupied the mountain heights and posts around Dras (Kargil, Batalik and Turtuk). The Indian Army and Air Force fought the war and reclaimed its territory. In the process India lost lives of 527 soldiers.

rmy chief General Bipin Rawat, Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa and Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh also paid tributes by laying wreaths at the Kargil War Memorial in Dras in Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking on the occasion General Rawat gave a message to Pakistan to not to repeat Kargil like misadventure. “Misadventures are not repeated. You (Pakistan) will get a bloodier nose this time.”

After paying homage at the National War Memorial, the defence minister also wrote a message in the visitors’ book. “Homage to the brave soldiers of Kargil War who laid down their lives for the honour, prestige and pride of India. Their valour and sacrifice are a motivation for every Indian,” he wrote.

Singh said the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers cannot be forgotten. "Our neighbouring country (Pakistan) cannot fight a full-fledged war or a limited war with India. It is fighting a proxy war," Singh said.
