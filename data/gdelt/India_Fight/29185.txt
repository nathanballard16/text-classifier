India's Modi makes unscheduled stop at bombed Sri Lanka church

Mr Modi is stopping in Colombo on his return home after an official visit to neighbouring Maldives, where he inaugurated a coastal radar system and military training centre.

His brief but politically significant visit to the two neighbours comes as New Delhi seeks to fend off Chinese influence in the strategic nations.

The Maldives, a low-lying archipelago of more than a thousand tiny coral islands south of the Indian subcontinent, straddles the world's busiest east-west maritime route.

Sri Lanka is located at the halfway point of the same sea route.

India, the traditional ally of both Sri Lanka and the Maldives, had watched with unease as former governments of strongman leader Abdulla Yameen of the Maldives and Sri Lanka's Mahinda Rajapaksa leaned towards Beijing for political and financial support.

Mr Yameen's election loss last September, however, has seen the new administration under President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih swing back towards New Delhi.

Colombo too has moved back to New Delhi after the defeat of Mr Rajapaksa in January 2015.

Last month, Colombo announced entering into partnership with India and Japan to develop a deep-sea container terminal next to a controversial US$500 million (S$680 million) Chinese-run facility in the capital.
