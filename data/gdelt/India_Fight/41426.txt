The Story Behind Gunjan Saxena – The Kargil Girl

We were greeted with the first look posters of Janhvi Kapoor from the highly-awaited Gunjan Saxena – The Kargil Girl today. Kapoor plays the role of Indian Air Force officer Gunjan Saxena who has the honour of being the first Indian woman combat aviator to be commissioned into the war zone during the Kargil War, reports New Delhi Television.

“She was told ‘Ladkiyan pilot nahin banti‘, but she stood her ground and wanted to fly,” Karan Johar stated while releasing the posters.

Saxena was awarded the Shaurya Chakra – an Indian military decoration which was awarded to her for her valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice. Both Saxena’s father and brother were serving in the Indian Army at the time. “I could not wait to be called,” said Gunjan Saxena to Outlook India in an interview back in 2006.

Indian Youth reports that Saxena was enlisted to airdrop vital supplies to Indian troops at high points in the Dras and Batalik sectors. According to the website, she also was crucial in informing her seniors about enemy positions and their status which helped the Indian Army strategise.

That’s not all – a rocket was fired at her helicopter by the Pakistani Army and she managed to escape the attack.

The film, produced by Zee Studios and Dharma Productions also stars Pankaj Tripathi as Saxena’s father. The film is directed by Sharan Sharma.
