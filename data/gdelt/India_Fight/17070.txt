Mumbai: Model held for fake call centre scam

Model and small-time actress Arti Saxena, who is said to be an accomplice in the fake call centres scam in Andheri, was arrested by crime branch police on Monday. According to the police, Saxena had surrendered herself on Monday evening after the High Court rejected her application for anticipatory bail. After the police raided the fake call centres in September, Saxena, who was a co-owner of Xfinity call centre, had fled the city and was absconding. When Saxena approached Bombay HC for an anticipatory bail, ice provided relevant documents and proofs, supporting her link in the fake call centres, based on which the anticipatory bail was rejected. The court also ordered her to surrender, following which she surrendered herself near Killa Court on Monday evening, said police.
