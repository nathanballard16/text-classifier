IAF squadrons which downed Pak F-16, conducted Balakot strike to be awarded by Air Chief

Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria will award unit citation to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's 51 Squadron for thwarting the aerial attack by Pakistan and shooting down a Pakistani F-16 jet on February 27. The award will be received by commanding officer group Captain Satish Pawar.

The award is slated to be received by commanding officer Group Captain Satish Pawar on October 8.

During Pakistan's counter-attack on India in response to the Balakot air strike, Abhinandan Varthaman flew a MiG-21 Bison fighter jet into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). He was grounded due to ejection from his MiG-21 which was shot down in the aerial conflict with Pakistan Air Force F-16s.

Abhinandan Varthaman was released by the Pakistani government after pressure was exerted by India and the international community. He was also conferred with the third-highest wartime gallantry award, Vir Chakra on the 73rd Independence Day.

The number 9 Squadron, whose Mirage 2000 fighter jet carried out the air strike in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 during 'Operation Bandar', will also be awarded citation.

Along with the units which carried out Balakot strike and thwarted Pakistani aerial attack, Squadron leader Minty Agarwal's 601 Signal Unit will be awarded unit citation for their role in the same.
