'Communal because we sing Vande Mataram, want Art 370 to go'? When Swaraj attacked Cong's 'secularism' in Parliament

'Communal because we sing Vande Mataram, want Art 370 to go'? When Swaraj attacked Cong's 'secularism' in Parliament

Former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for abrogating Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in her last tweet just hours before her demise, saying that she had been waiting to see this day in her lifetime."Narendra Modi ji - Thank you Prime Minister. Thank you very much. I was waiting to see this day in my lifetime," she said in her last tweet referring to the abrogation of Article 370.Her tweet came soon after Parliament approved the resolution ending the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Scrapping of Article 370 has been one of BJP's long-standing dreams from the time Syama Prasad Mukherjee lost his life fighting for this cause in J&K. Like other top party leaders, Sushma Swaraj too wanted the contentious article to be abrogated and many times in public meeting and speeches she had made her stance clear. One of her speeches which is still recalled fondly was when she was speaking against the trust motion of Deve Gowda government, which was propped up by the Congress.

Swaraj brutally attacked the then ruling regime for forging an opportunistic alliance using 'secularism as figleaf'. Many of her arguments are still remarkably relevant in 2019 India, which is going through a cultural war regarding what should be the 'idea of India'.

Deve Gowda won the trust vote and became PM for a period of one year. But Swaraj's speech on that day, in a hindsight, laid down the marker of what BJP seeks to achieve when they get the people's mandate. Interestingly, Swaraj in 1996 was a prominent BJP leader, whereas Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were still coming up the ranks and weren't in the top echelons.
