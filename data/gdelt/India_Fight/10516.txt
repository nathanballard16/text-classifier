New Delhi: After claiming earlier in the day that it had shot down two Indian Air Force jets and had two Indian pilots in its custody, Pakistan took a big U-turn in the evening and said it was holding only one Indian officer. Major General Asif Ghafoor, spokesperson of the Pakistan armed forces, tweeted that “there is only one pilot under Pakistan Army’s custody”. Ghafoor said the Indian pilot is being treated as per norms of military ethics.

The Pakistani U-turn came shortly after India said that only one Air Force pilot was ‘missing in action’. Ghafoor had earlier said that two IAF pilots were arrested. One of them was injured and taken to a hospital, while the second one was unhurt and in custody, he added.

While India has acknowledged that the pilot was in Pakistan’s custody, sources in New Delhi said the MiG-21 Bison crash-landed in the Pakistani territory and was not shot down as claimed by Pakistan.

The Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi that Pakistan Air Force had this morning tried to target military installations in Jammu and Kashmir, a day after Indian air strikes at a JeM terror camp killed over 350 terrorists.

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Indian Air Force jets successfully foiled the Pakistan attempts but one Indian pilot was "missing in action".

To Pakistan’s claim that the missing Indian pilot was in their custody, the spokesperson said, “We are ascertaining that.”

India said one Pakistani fighter jet had been shot down in the engagement along the border in Jammu and Kashmir.
