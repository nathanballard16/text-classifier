Landing On Lunar Surface: How Chandrayaan-2 Will Travel From Earth To Moon

In 2008, India made its first big leap into space as Chandrayaan-1, our first lunar mission, set out for the moon. A small cube about five feet on each side, it orbited the moon and beamed back evidence of water on the lunar surface and tens of metres below it, and, in the process, gave life to new geological curiosities. But 10 months into its two-year-long mission, it fell silent, bringing the exploration to an abrupt end.

Ten years later, India is returning to the moon to find answers to these curiosities, and many more, which continue to elude explanation. And this time, on the lunar surface.

Carrying a lander and a rover, Chandrayaan-2 will trace the same path to the moon and go beyond, where no human or machine has ever soft-landed — the moon’s apparently water-rich but freezing-cold south pole. Captivating, indeed.

But for those not impressed, here’s a little more: this region of the moon hides a dense metallic mass estimated to be 4.8 quintillion pounds. Right, that’s 4,800,000,000,000,000,000 pounds — all zeros included.

Chandrayaan-2’s journey to the moon will begin atop the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO’s) heaviest rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mark III. The lander, named Vikram, and the rover, christened Pragyan, will be interfaced mechanically with the orbiter and accommodated inside this launch vehicle. The six-wheel rover will be housed inside the lander.

When the launch is set into motion, the first to ignite will be the two solid strap-on boosters on both sides of the rocket. Breathing out orange plume, the boosters give the rocket the thrust required for lift-off and guide it through its brief but majestic vertical ascent. A few seconds later, the liquid-fuelled core, or the second stage, powered by a pair of Vikas engines, will fire, and the strap-on boosters, having served their purpose, will be dumped.
