A suspect wanted over the murder of a sex worker in 1997 no longer faces charges after a takeaway owner admitted the killing.

At the High Court in Glasgow this week, Zhi Min Chen, 44, pled guilty to strangling Tracy Wylde, 21, in her city flat.

Prosecutors had been trying to extradite an Indian man arrested in Mumbai four years ago over the murder.

But legal sources yesterday said Sougat Mukherjee, 40, is now in the clear.

Chinese-born Chen was last year collared for Tracy’s murder after DNA samples he gave following an alleged assault in Cowcaddens matched samples found when Tracy’s body was discovered.

The dad-of-two is facing life in prison when he returns to court next month for sentence.

We told yesterday of Tracy’s family’s sadness that her mum Fay is not alive to see justice prevail. She died of bowel cancer last year.

Tracy’s sister Bernadette, 34, said her mum would be “relieved” and “delighted” that her daughter’s killer has finally been snared. She said: “It’s the end of a long road for us all.”

Mukherjee was a teenage student in Glasgow when Tracy was murdered at her Barmulloch flat in November 1997.

He was identified as a suspect 16 years later after a cold-case review and tracked down to India, where he was arrested and bailed.

Red tape held up his extradition.
