Panvel police recovered body of a two-year-old girl from a lodge Saturday, while her mother, allegedly on the run after killing her husband, was found unconscious in the room with her paramour.

The staff of Panvel’s Samir Lodge reportedly found the occupants of room number 101 unconscious Saturday afternoon and alerted the police. “All the three occupants showed signs of poisoning and were rushed to a hospital.

While the child was declared dead on arrival, the woman and the man were sent to JJ hospital, where their condition was stated to be critical,” a police officer said.

Police identified the man as Waseem Abdul Kadir (34), a resident of Santapur in Kerala, on the basis of the identification provided to the lodge while booking the room. “When contacted, Santapur police informed us that Kadir was an accused in a murder and had been on the run since October 31,” the officer said.

Santapur police identified the woman as Lijo Kurien (29). According to Santapur police, Kurien and Kadir had allegedly killed the woman’s husband, Rijosh, and buried his body near a farmhouse where they all worked. “They had fled from Kerala with Kurien’s youngest daughter and were last traced to Mumbai,” an officer from Santapur police said.

On Saturday, Panvel police registered a case of murder against Kurien and Kadir for the death of her daughter Joana, sources said. “They consumed a poisonous substance and fed it to the child as well. We found a bottle of a chemical compound and have sent it for forensic examining,” a senior officer said.
