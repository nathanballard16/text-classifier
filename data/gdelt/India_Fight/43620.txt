Imran Khan Concedes Pakistan Could Lose In War With India Over Kashmir; Issues Nuclear Threat Again

Khan has further claimed that trade and markets have blocked and prevented the world to react over the Kashmir issue.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has once again issued a nuclear war threat to India in an interview to a Russian TV channel and said that if any conflict arises over Kashmir it will be two nuclear armed countries facing each other. However, he also conceded his defeat at the international front over the Kashmir issue despite his desperate attempts to internationalise the matter and said that he expected the world to react more. He admitted that India has made Jammu and Kashmir a part of its territory after the abrogation of Article 370 which granted special status to the former Indian state. In an exclusive interview to Russia Today that aired on Friday, Khan said: "...India has annexed Kashmir, so it is no longer a disputed territory as far as India is concerned. They have made it a part of India." "Sadly, I would have expected the world to react much more than it has," said Khan, while accusing the Indian government of violating the Simla agreement.
