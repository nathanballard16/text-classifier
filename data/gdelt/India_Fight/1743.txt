After shooting at Miranda House for three days, the cast and crew of 'Kabir Singh' – the Hindi remake of Telugu film ' Arjun Reddy ' – shot for a canteen scene at Lady Irwin College on Saturday. Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani reached the college early in the morning and shot near the old canteen of the college. A source tells us, “Shahid and Kiara started shooting at the college at around 8am and the shoot went on till 9pm. They needed to show the entire area of the old canteen, and students were not allowed to enter the area or see the shoot. After shooting at the old canteen, the location was changed to the front lawns, where a bonfire scene was also shot.” According to sources, the film’s crew will shoot at more colleges in DU, apart from other locations all over Delhi.
