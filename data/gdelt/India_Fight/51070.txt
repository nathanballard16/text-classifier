Stabber reveals complainant’s drug dealings

Vadodara: Police arrested one of the two accused who had allegedly stabbed a real estate broker at Khodiyarnagar crossroads on Sunday late evening. The accused, Ankur Thakor, during police interrogation spilled beans about the broker Sanjay Tank, following which he too was booked.

Thakor told cops that Tank had hidden marijuana in his house at Akota and sells it to addicts. Based on Thakor’s statement police raided Tank’s house and found marijuana worth Rs 11,000. Police registered a case under Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act against Tank at JP Road police station.
