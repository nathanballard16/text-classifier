Srinagar: Terrorists Shoot Dead 65-Year-Old Shopkeeper For Defying Their Call To Keep Businesses Shut

Terrorists have shot dead a 65-year old shopkeeper in the Parimpora area on the outskirts of Srinagar for defying their call for keeping businesses shut, reports The Times of India.

As per local eyewitnesses, the terrorists rode by on a motorbike while Ghulam Mohammad was closing the shutters of his grocery store and shot him dead. The killing has caused a panic among other small businessmen in the city and large numbers of shops remained shut in its aftermath.

This is the fourth killing of a civilian by terrorists and their separatists sympathisers in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of Article 370’s revocation. Earlier, a trucker was stoned to death by a mob and two Gujjars were shot dead by terrorists in a separate incident.

In response to the latest killing, authorities tightened security all across Srinagar and neighbouring areas, with barricades and checkpoints maintaining vigilance against any signs of trouble.
