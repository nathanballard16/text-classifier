Even as prohibitory orders remain in force in parts of West Bengal, clashes erupted between Trinamool Congress and BJP workers on Monday night, following which three BJP supporters were left injured.

Clashes broke out between cadres of Trinamool and BJP on Monday night in Coochbehar's Sitai area. Three BJP workers suffered bullet injuries. A shop belonging to a BJP worker was also allegedly torched in the same clashes.

BJP has blamed Trinamool workers for the violence while the ruling party has denied all charges.

Days left to the election results, Bengal continues to simmer in tension as multiple exit polls predicted a big win for NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and a significant gain for BJP in the Mamata Banerjee bastion.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission on Monday clamped prohibitory orders in Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district, following violence in the area during the assembly by-election on Sunday.

Keeping in mind the "sensitive" situation in Bhatpara, it was decided to impose Section 144 of the CrPC, the EC official told reporters in Kolkata.

The commission had sought a report from the district magistrate on Sunday's poll-related violence in Bhatpara.

"Going by the report of the DM, Section 144 was clamped. It will prohibit assembly of five or more people. Our security forces are posted in the area and we are keeping a tab on the situation," he said.

Madan Mitra, the TMC candidate for the Bhatpara assembly constituency, on Monday visited the EC office, accusing BJP leader Arjun Singh of "using force" to stop him from entering the town.

On Tuesday, angry locals blocked the railway station at Kakinada protesting against the violence. Railway Police Force (RPF) personnel and Rapid Action Force (RAF) have been deployed to lift the blockade.
