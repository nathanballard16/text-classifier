Mumbai: Model held for fake call centre scam

Model and small-time actress Arti Saxena, who is said to be an accomplice in the fake call centres scam in Andheri, was arrested by crime branch police on Monday. Police had unearthed the scam in September last year, wherein eight people were arrested for running two fake call centres under the names of Xfinity and Innovation 360 at DN Nagar in Andheri West, cheating scores of US nationals.

According to the police, Saxena had surrendered herself on Monday evening after the High Court rejected her application for anticipatory bail. After the police raided the fake call centres in September, Saxena, who was a co-owner of Xfinity call centre, had fled the city and was absconding.

"Saxena was hiding at her mother's residence in Kota, Rajasthan, while constantly trying to secure an anticipatory bail with the help of a Delhi-based lawyer," said Assistant Police Inspector Asha Korke.

When Saxena approached Bombay HC for an anticipatory bail, ice provided relevant documents and proofs, supporting her link in the fake call centres, based on which the anticipatory bail was rejected. The court also ordered her to surrender, following which she surrendered herself near Killa Court on Monday evening, said police.
