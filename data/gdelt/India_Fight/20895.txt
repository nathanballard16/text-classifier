Tral: According to news agency PTI, terrorists fired grenades at a CRPF camp in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) injuring personnel of the paramilitary force. According to reports, an under barrel grenade launcher (UBGL) was used for carrying out the attack. Times Now channel reported that the attack was followed by a heavy exchange of fire between the security forces and terrorists.

The grenades were fired at Tral-based 180th battalion camp of the CRPF. The grenade exploded inside the Bravo company of the unit causing minor injuries to a head constable.

According to officials, the injured jawan is being treated. The security forces have launched a search operation for the terrorists responsible for carrying out the attack. The attack comes on the backdrop of the February 14 Pulwama attack on the CRPF which resulted in the death of 40 personnel.

A terrorist belonging to Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) carried out a suicide attack on a 78-bus convoy of the CRPF resulting in the death of CRPF men.

This was followed by an escalation of tension between India and Pakistan which resulted in the Indian Air Force (IAF) carrying out air strikes at Balakot in Pakistan destroying the JeM terror camps at the location.
