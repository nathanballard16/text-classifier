The youth, who worked in Pune as a welder, succumbed to his injuries on June 22, while in judicial custody. The video of the youth being attacked with rods had gone viral.The police have allegedly diluted the charges from murder to culpable homicide following medical and forensic reports which said Ansari died of cardiac arrest while in custody.Ansari’s widow, who met state officials in Jharkhand on Monday, threatened to commit suicide if the police didn’t restore murder charges against 11 people.The IIM-B group, expressing “shock and dismay” over the way the police handled the case, urged the PM to “act swiftly and decisively” by directing the state government to institute a fresh probe. “It is the constitutional duty of the state to protect the life and liberty of all citizens,” their letter read.
