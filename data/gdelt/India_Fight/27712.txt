Rogue lone tusker plays hide ’n seek with kumkis

Coimbatore: Kumki elephants Bharani and Suyambu, which were taken to the Navamalai tribal settlement on Monday morning to drive away a rogue wild elephant that killed two people in a span of two days, are still searching for the troublemaker.

Forest department officials believe that the presence of the kumkis is scaring the lone wild elephant. “It was sighted only once, just as the kumkis arrived on Monday morning,” Pollachi district forest officer Maarimuthu said.

The elephant had terrorized the tribal hamlet over the weekend by trampling a man and a boy to death.

The kumkis, guided by their mahouts, are roaming the forests behind the Monkey Falls in search of the wild elephant. “We believe that the elephant is scared of the kumkis. If the kumkis guard the forest fringes for another two weeks, the wild elephant should move away to another range,” range officer Kasilingam said.

Meanwhile, the 45 inmates of the tribal hamlet have been told to spend nights at the Tangedo-run shelter in the area and not to step out after the dark. “We are also in talks with the revenue department to give them land and build them concrete or brick houses instead of thatched houses. But the tribals are refusing to move,” said Maarimuthu.

The forest department does not want to capture and relocate another elephant like Vinayaka. Such an operation would be risky and complicated, department sources said.
