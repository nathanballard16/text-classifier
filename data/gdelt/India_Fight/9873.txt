55 Rashtriya Rifles personnel were martyred in a gun battle with terrorists in Pulwama. The forces were conducting searches when the militants open fired, triggering off a gun battle.

The slain soldiers were Major V S Dhondial, Havaldar Sheo Ram and Sepoys Hari Singh and Ajay Kumar.

PTI quoted the Mother of Sepoy Ajay Kumar as saying, "Pakistan has killed so many sons; Pakistan is not that big that India cannot destroy it. India can destroy it in one day. I am proud of my son, he sacrificed his life for the country."

The top Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander Abdul Rasheed Ghazi alias Kamran, was gunned down in the 12-hour-long encounter.
