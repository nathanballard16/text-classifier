On December 17, 2018, a huge fire broke out at the ESIC hospital in Marol, north west Mumbai, in which 6 people were killed and over 150 were injured.

Amidst the heart-rending tragedy, Mumbai found a hero, Siddrameshwar Humanabade, a 19 year old who saved 10 lives that evening.

Siddhu, as he is called, a resident of Airoli in the satellite town of Navi Mumbai, had joined food delivery giant Swiggy just weeks earlier and was out making a drop when he saw the fumes.

He dumped his bag, and jumped in to help.

"Bachpan se hi mujhe sabki madad karna pasand hai (from my childhood I have been helping people)," says the fearless lad who says he will readily risk his life again if the occasion so demanded.

Siddrameshwar, a Class 10 pass-out, quit his studies and started doing odd jobs to support his family.

His father Hanumant had a paralytic attack four years ago and has been at home since then. His mother Reshma works at a firm in Ghansoli, Navi Mumbai. His sibling, Malik Arjun, is in Class 11.

For his bravery, Siddrameshwar has been rewarded by his employer. He also received a citation from Santosh Kumar Gangwar, the Union minister of state for labour and employement.
