PHOTOS: Robert Pattinson clicks photos with fans during his stay in India for the shoot of Tenet

Seeing Hollywood celebrities visit India is always a treat! Whether it be Brad Pitt and Will Smith coming down to Mumbai to promote their respective films or Game of Thrones stars Emilia Clarke and Rose Leslie visiting Uttarakhand for a spiritual vacation, India has become the new hub for Hollywood stars. Not that we're complaining! This time, it's Robert Pattinson and Christopher Nolan who have come to Mumbai to shoot for a schedule for their film, Tenet, which also stars our very own Dimple Kapadia.

It was on September 14, when Christopher and Robert came unannounced to Mumbai and quietly headed for their hotel in Colaba. Only one lucky fan was able to click a selfie with Robert. More fans got a chance to interact with the Batman star, later on, in the hotel, where he was staying. The 33-year-old actor, who recently attended TIFF 2019 for his film The Lighthouse, was happy to oblige the fans with some photos. The actor kept it casual cool in a black shirt, beige pants, a black snapback and black and orange sneakers.

Check out Rob's photos with his fans below:
