The nation's hero, air warrior and recipient of Vir Chakra, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman is back in action as he just flew a joint sortie with IAF Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa in MiG-21 on Monday. According to reports, the sortie flew from Pathankot airbase, the front-line fighter base and home to the 26 Squadron of the Indian Air Force; and lasted for around half-an-hour.

Dhanoa was quoted saying "It was a pleasure for me to fly with Abhinandan because he has got his flying category back, that is what all pilots look forward to. I also ejected in 1988, it took me 9 months to get my category back. He has been back in less than 6 months."

A senior Air Force officer told IANS, "The sortie (today) was flown from the Pathankot air base in Punjab. (Wing Commander) Abhinandan had been cleared for flying last month following a thorough medical check-up."

Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa led the squadron of frontline ground attack fighters during the Kargil war in 1999. Under his leadership, the squadron devised innovative methods of night bombing at high altitudes which had never been attempted before. He was also honoured with Yudh Seva Medal (YSM) and Vayu Sena Medal (VM) for his bravery during the war.

Both Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa and Abhinandan are MiG-21 pilots. In February 2019, Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was held captive by the Pakistan Army for almost three days, after his aircraft MiG-21 Bison crashed on the other side of LoC during aerial combat between the two countries.

On March 1, he was released by Pakistan Prime MInister Imran Khan as a "gesture of peace".
