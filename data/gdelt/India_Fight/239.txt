Reportedly, the order mentioned that the family would be allowed to enter the village only after they take a dip in the holy Ganga, donate a cow and organise a mass feast.

The panchayat was led by the village sarpanch, Pancham Singh Chauhan. And the victim was identified as 36-year-old Pappu Prajapati. The victim told the HT that he was parking his tractor-trolley when it hit a cow that was sitting on the ground behind. Meanwhile, the cow died on the spot.
