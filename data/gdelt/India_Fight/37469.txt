When it was announced that veteran Indian actor Dimple Kapadia will be a part of Christopher Nolan’s upcoming spy-thriller Tenet, it was quite a surprise. Some on-set pictures, revealing Kapadia’s look in Tenet, were released online recently. The actor will be sporting grey hair in the film.

While the shoot of the film is currently taking place in Estonia, it will soon shift to Mumbai in September this year. Tenet will be shot in as many as seven countries.

The much anticipated film also features Robert Pattinson, John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Clémence Poésy, Michael Caine and Kenneth Branagh among others. Tenet is scheduled to be released on July 17, 2020.
