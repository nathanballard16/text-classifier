The firebrand actor has said, “I am a Rajput too, and if I am harassed, I will destroy each and every one of them (Karni Sena members).

The Karni Sena, on its part has already shot of letters to the producers, directors and scriptwriters of the film stating that if the image of Rani Laxmibai is tarnished on the screen or if she is shown to be the lover of any British man, then the makers will face dire consequences.

Kangana has said that Manikarnika has already been passed by the Censor board and four eminent historians have certified the authenticity of it. Hence, if the Karni Sena continues to disturb and harass her, she will retort.
