MADURAI

Madurai district police have arrested a woman, a mother of two children, in connection with the murder of retired head constable M. Thangaraj, 72, at a lodge in Alagarkoil on February 4.

The police said the 36-year-old woman had gone to the lodge with Thangaraj and disappeared after the murder. A special team picked up the woman and her children in Tirunelveli and interrogated them.

During interrogation, the woman reportedly told the police about the illicit relationship she had developed with Thangaraj, when she used to visit her mother, who was his tenant.

The woman, who had two children, had been living with another man near Chennai.

Thangaraj took the woman and her children to the lodge. The woman reportedly said he tried to misbehave with her minor daughter at the lodge and she opposed it. Following a scuffle, she reportedly pushed Thangaraj down and then attacked him on his private parts. After he died, the trio fled the scene.

Appanthirupathi police arrested the woman and sent her for remand.
