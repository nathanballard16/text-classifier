“The incident took place in a house in Naurang-abad locality of the city. Later, the video of the event went viral on social media,” senior superinte-ndent of police of Aligarh Akash Kulhary said.

After the video went viral, a case was registered against 13 persons associated with Hindu Mahasabha including Pooja Shakun Pandey, a woman leader, the SSP said, adding no arrests have been made so far. The police are conducting raids to nab the accused persons.
