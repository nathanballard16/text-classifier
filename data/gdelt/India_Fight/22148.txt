'No vote, no choice of burger', says McDonald's

In the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, over 130 million young adults will get to cast their vote. Most of this Gen Z populous has grown up in the era of social media and smartphones and are believed to be politically aware, those who actively fight the 'hashtag war' for an India they believe they deserve. Targeting this huge population and also aiming to encourage these young voters, Hardcastle Restaurants, the master franchisee of McDonald's in West and South India, launched a social activation titled #MakeYourChoice.
