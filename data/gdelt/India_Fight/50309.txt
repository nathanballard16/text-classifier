JDS supremo HD Deve Gowda wants BS Yediyurappa govt to survive

It seems like the father-son duo of the JD(S) has decided to throw their full weight behind the government headed by BS Yediyurappa. JD(S) supremo and former PM HD Deve Gowda on Tuesday stated that it would be in the interest of his party if the BJP government survives in the state for its entire tenure.

Speaking to India Today TV, he said that he is confident BS Yediyurappa will complete his term as the CM. He claimed that this will give his party sufficient time to strengthen itself.

According to the former PM, it will not be advantageous for his party if the BJP-run government in the state fails. "Let them complete their term. If they give good governance, people will appreciate. If they do not, people will then teach them a lesson," he said, adding that, finally, the advantage will go the opposition, be it the Congress or his party.

A few days ago, HD Deve Gowda's son and Kumaraswamy had said that the current government must last while the state battles the after-effects of floods. "I recently toured the flood-affected regions in the state. When I saw the plight of people there I felt that it was unfair to impose another election on people in this crisis. That is why, I believe the present government should continue," Kumaraswamy had said, later clarifying, "I have no plans of extending support to the BJP in the elections."

Sources tell India Today TV that many leaders within the JD(S) are miffed with the arbitrary decisions taken by the former CM and the neglect many of them are facing. Among the 17 MLAs, whose disqualifications necessitated the upcoming bypolls, three belonged to the JD(S).
