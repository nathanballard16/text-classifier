Gurugram: In yet another crime against women reported from Gurugram, Haryana, a man working at a night club as a bouncer allegedly shot dead a 22-year-old woman on Saturday. The accused committed the heinous crime for not withdrawing a rape case filed against him.

According to a report by the news agency ANI, the victim's body was found lying near Khusboo Chowk situated on Gurgaon-Faridabad expressway. The passerby informed the police control room about the body.

Meanwhile, the accused was identified as Sandeep Kumar. The police officials told the agency that Kumar murdered the woman just a few hours before she was to record her statement in the court.

The victim's mother told ANI, the accused came to their house situated in Nathupur and requested to speak to my daughter in his car. Later, my daughter along with her friend sat in the car. But around 6 am in the morning, Sandeep came to me and started pressurising me to take the case back, failing to do which he said he would kill my daughter, the mother added.
