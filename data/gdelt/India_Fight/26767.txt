Woman attacked for living with man from another community

A 24-year-old woman from Tripura was allegedly attacked by armed men claiming to be members of the right-wing group Bajrang Dal for living with a man from a different community.

The woman informed the police that on Saturday night, a group of men barged into her house in Hebbal, beat up her friend and ransacked the premises. They also took away her education certificates.

In her complaint to the police, which she lodged on Tuesday, the woman said her uncle, identified as Titu Ghosh, used to threaten her for leaving her family in Tripura and settling down in Bengaluru with a man who was not from their community.

“She said he threatened to end her life if she didn’t comply. We suspect that he hired local goons to attack the victim in her house and efforts are on to track them down,” said a senior police officer.

Over the past few months, ever since she relocated to Bengaluru with her partner, the woman had been receiving threat calls from various people her uncle had allegedly contacted. She shared the numbers and details with the police.

Based on her complaint, the police have taken up a case against Titu, charging him with extortion, assault, and criminal intimidation, among other sections of Indian Penal Code. Efforts are on to identify and track the group that barged into her house, the police added.
