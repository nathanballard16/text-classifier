While every celeb wants global recognition, there are many B-town stars who turned down iconic Hollywood roles due to various reasons. The first one on this list is the King of Bollywood, Shah Rukh Khan who had a golden opportunity to make an international debut with Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. According to reports, SRK was offered the role of Anil Kapoor in the film but he rejected it as he thought that the role wasn't good enough for him. The movie went on to become a blockbuster and won several Academy Awards.
