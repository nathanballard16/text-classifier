Police ‘raid’ college hostels in Vizag

Barely a week after Director-General of Police (DGP) R.P. Thakur said that educational institutions in the city would be brought under scanner in the wake of alleged drug peddling at a rave party reported from Rushikonda, special teams of the city police reportedly raided several college hostels on Monday evening.

According to a senior police officer, the raids were conducted after they had received information that several students were smoking ganja in the hostels of an reputed educational institution.

Though the police are tight-lipped on the details, sources said that the teams did not recover any contraband from the campus. It is learnt that the police teams are still on the job and surveillance is on.

During his recent visit to the city, the DGP had made it clear that the managements of educational institutions would be held responsible if their students were found using or in possession of ganja or drugs.

Police said incidents of students using drugs in hostels were not new. In February last year, students of a reputed educational institution were caught consuming weed in their hostels. Fingers were pointed to the poor surveillance in the hostels of the colleges and universities.

Supply chain

The issue was brought to the fore again with the arrest of five people in connection with alleged drug peddling at a rave party at Rushikonda on April 13.

“Surveillance is on the people who had a history of supplying and peddling drugs in the city,” a police officer, who is dealing with the drugs case, said.
