“Six civilians including 2 children died in IAF airstrikes across LoC,” says Pakistan

A day after Indian Air Force carried out air strikes across LoC and bombed major camps of Pakistan based terror groups in Balkot, Pakistan police claimed that mortar shells fired by Indian troops from across the frontier in the Himalayan region of Kashmir struck homes, killing six civilians including two children and wounding several others.

According to the media reports, local police official Mohammad Altaf said that six people, including children, were killed on Wednesday in Kotli village of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).

The latest civilian casualties came a day after tensions escalated sharply following a pre-dawn airstrike by India that New Delhi said targeted a terrorist training camp in northwest Pakistan.

Meanwhile, Indian officials said at least five of India’s soldiers were also wounded in cross-border firing along the LoC.

The raids followed a suicide attack earlier this month in India-administered Kashmir, which killed 42 Indian troops when a rebel rammed his explosives-laden car into a paramilitary convoy.

It was the deepest cross-border attack launched by India since the last of its three wars with Pakistan in 1971 when the two nations fought over Bangladesh’s independence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Imran Khan both summoned emergency meetings of top ministers after the attack.
