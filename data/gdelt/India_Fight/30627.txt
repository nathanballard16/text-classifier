Keerthy Suresh shares gorgeous photo in bathrobe. Fans are concerned about her weight loss

Keerthy Suresh has lost oodles of weight and her fans are worried.

Keerthy Suresh recently took to her Instagram account to share a sunkissed snap of herself from her getaway in Spain. She looks gorgeous as she poses against the city landscape in a white bathrobe.

While the stunning photo is getting a lot of love from the actress's fans, many of them were concerned about her weight loss. "Please gain weight again," one Instagram user wrote, while another commented, "We want our old Keerthy back."

Keerthy is in Spain to shoot for her upcoming project, which has tentatively been titled Sakhi. Cinema Express reports that the cast and crew are currently shooting for a 45-day schedule in different locations across Europe.

"A team - comprising of 50 artistes and technicians - has left for Europe on Monday. They will be shooting a couple of songs in Spain. They will return to the city (Hyderabad) by the end of July, and complete the rest of the shoot here," a source close to the development revealed.

Helmed by debutant director Narendra Nath and produced by Mahesh S Koneru, Sakhi is reportedly scheduled to hit the theatres around Dussehra.

Apart from this, Keerthy will be seen in a special appearance in Rahul Ravindran's Manmandhudu 2, alongside superstar Nagarjuna Akkineni. In an Instagram post, the actress said that it was "an honour" to be a part of the film.
