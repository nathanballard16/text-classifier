Writer Manoj Nair found dead at his Kochi home

Musician and writer Manoj Nair was found dead at his rented house at Saudi, Fort Kochi, on Saturday afternoon.

Originally from Irinjalakkuda in Thrissur district, Mr. Nair, in his 50s, had been living alone in Fort Kochi since 2010. He was associated with Kochi Muziris Biennale since its inception and had been working on a book, Between the Rock and a Hard Place, on the history of alternative music in India, which was set to hit the stands next year. He had worked as a journalist covering music and art in the past.

His landlord Derson Antony had found the body around 12 noon. “The body seemed to be some three to four days old. There were no injuries on the body and as of now we don’t suspect any foul play behind the death. However, the cause of death would be known only after post mortem, which would be done as soon as the relatives are here,” said K. Saji, Sub Inspector, Thoppumpady.

Police conducted the inquest and the body was moved to the mortuary. A case for unnatural death has been registered under Section 174 of CrPC.

Mr. Antony said he had last spoken to the victim around three days ago. “He told me that he was sick and when I asked him to go for medicines he said that he was broke,” he said. Mr. Antony had given him a call on Friday and his mobile phone was switched off. His attempt to reach him on Saturday morning also met with the same fate. But that didn’t invoke any suspicions since the victim was known to work late into the night and woke up late.

When another call around 11.30 a.m. also met with a switched-off message, Mr. Antony dropped in at his house and found the body. He informed two artist friends of the victim, followed by the police.
