Street Dancer 3D: Varun Dhawan strikes the perfect pose on the streets of London as he shoots for the film

As we speak, the cast and crew of Remo D’Souza’s Street Dancer 3D are shooting in the freezing weather of London, and it was only recently that Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor jetted off to England to continue the second schedule of the film. Soon after reaching London, Shraddha Kapoor had posted a picture on social media where she was seen posing with director Remo D’Souza, and in the picture, Shraddha was seen resting her head on Remo while he was holding onto to the clapboard. Shraddha wrote, “Leaning on the right shoulder @remodsouza Paving the way #StreetDancer3D #Day1Done @varundvn @prabhudheva @tseries.official @lizelleremodsouza.”

Today, Varun Dhawan posted a picture on Instagram where he is seen striking the perfect dance pose on the streets of London and his caption read as, ‘#sd3.’ In the photo, Varun is wearing a yellow shirt and grey joggers and this photo is making us impatient for the film. Before heading to London, Varun Dhawan was undergoing intense training for the film and the Sui Dhaaga actor had taken to Instagram to post a video attempting a backflip with his caption as, ‘#3prep #streetdancer3d #nodaysoff @kuldeepshashi @flyzonefitness. My whole body hurts.’

Before heading to London, Varun Dhawan and the cast of the film kick-started the first schedule of Street Dancer 3D in Amritsar, and now, for the second schedule, Prabhudheva will be joining the cast of the film. Helmed by Remo D'Souza, Street Dancer 3D is the third installment of the ABCD franchise and features Shraddha Kapoor, Varun Dhawan, Nora Fatehi in lead roles. In the film, it is being reported that while Varun will play a dancer from Punjab, Shraddha will be seen as a dancer from Pakistan. Street Dancer 3D will release on 8th November, 2019.
