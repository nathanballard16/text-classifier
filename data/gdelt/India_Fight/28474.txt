Man confesses to killing 2 persons, arrested

A 35-year-old man, who allegedly admitted to killing two people last week, was arrested after he surrendered before the Karkardooma court on Monday, police said.

After Anil's arrest, two juveniles were also apprehended from Loni in Ghaziabad in connection with the case, they said.

Last week, two people were killed after Anil and his accomplices opened fire at them in Jyoti Nagar area, police said.

The two deceased persons were identified as Govinda (28) and Akash, they said.

During interrogation, Anil told police that Govinda had beaten him following a heated argument in 2016 and that time, both of them had filed cross FIRs against each other.

"On the day of the incident, he, along with his associates, had fired upon Govinda when he was returning from a gym. During the shootout, some bullets hit a passerby who was later identified as Akash," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast) Atul Kumar Thakur said.

Earlier, three people -- Aman (19), Ankit (19), and Ashu (19) -- had also been arrested in connection with the case.
