India To Test-Fire Air-Launched Version Of BrahMos Missile To Prepare For Balakot-Type Strikes

The Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) are planning to testfire the air-launched version of the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile BrahMos next week from a Su-30MKI combat aircraft to boost ability to destroy major ground targets.

“Sources in the IAF said they are very keen on a fast-track development of the 290-km strike range missile which can destroy targets on the ground and can be used for Balakot-type air strikes, where the planes will not even have to cross enemy borders for the hit,” says a report by ANI.

"A test of the missile is planned for the next week in the southern part of the country to prove its integration with the heavyweight Su-30 fighter," said sources.

During Balakot airstrikes, launched in the wake of Pulwama attacks in February, IAF had used the Spice-2000 bombs launched from a Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft for striking Jaish-e Mohammed (JeM) terro camp in Pakistan.

With the help of the missile developed by DRDO, IAF would become efficient to destroy similar targets from at least 150 kilometres inside the Indian territory.

The world's fastest supersonic cruise missile was first flight tested in July 2018 over the Bay of Bengal from a Su-30MKI only.
