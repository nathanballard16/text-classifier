Moga, September 20

A ‘drug addict’ allegedly killed his mother with a shovel at Himmatpura village in Nihalsinghwala sub-division of Moga district on Friday, police officials confirmed here. The deceased woman has been identified as Karamjit Kaur (45).

According to information, Karamjit was preparing meal when her elder son Satwinder Singh, alias Samna, 22, attacked her. She was lying in a pool of blood when the police took the body to District Hospital for post-mortem examination, after which it was handed over to family for cremation.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the deceased’s husband Bhola Singh, a marginal farmer, had committed suicide about 20 years ago as he was debt-ridden.

A couple of years back, Karamjit sold a portion of her land and sent Satwinder Singh to Spain for greener pastures. But, Satwainder, who was reportedly a drug addict, did not work properly and returned to India last month.

After coming back, he again started consuming drugs. Her mother was not happy with him and used to object to it. It could be one of the reasons that Satwinder killed his mother, police officials said.

Meanwhile, the police registered a case of murder under Section 302 of the IPC against Satwinder at the Nihalsinghwala police station. The weapon used in the crime has been recovered.

It has been learnt that Satwinder fled the spot after committing the crime.

The police have launched a hunt to nab him.
