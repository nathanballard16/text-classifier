According to Hindustan Times' report, two gangs opened fire on each other on the market street of Sangam Vihar. Navratan Kaushik, a shop owner in the area stated that he heard five gunshots after which he pulled the shutter of his shop and ran upstairs to his house on the first floor.

The deputy commissioner of police (south) Vijay Kumar told the Hindustan Times that out of the eight suspects, the police have arrested six of them. All the six arrested have been identified as residents from Sangam Vihar and Dakshinpuri.

According to the police, the fight broke out after one of the accused Manoj Kumar came to know that a member of the rival gang, Mohammad Arshad, was an informer. An official said that last month, Manoj Kumar was arrested with his men from a parking lot in S-block Sangam Vihar. Though they were given a bail later, Manoj was under the impression that Arshad had told their location to the police, which led to the gun fight on Friday.
