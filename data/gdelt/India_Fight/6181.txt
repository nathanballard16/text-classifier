Pulwama attack: Perpetrators will not go unpunished, says Ravi Shankar Prasad

Stating in Madurai that the entire world has condemned the dastardly attack, Mr. Prasad said that Pakistan now stood isolated

The perpetrators of the suicide attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 37 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel will not go unpunished, said Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.

Talking to the media at Madurai airport here on Friday, Mr. Prasad said that the sacrifice of the CRPF jawans will not go in vain.

"There will be an appropriate and suitable response as may be strategically decided," he said.

Stating that the entire world has condemned the dastardly attack, Mr. Prasad said that Pakistan now stood isolated.

"Those who perpetrated, supported and patronised this heinous attack would not go unpunished," he said.

Mr. Prasad, who was scheduled to participate in a series of events in Madurai, cancelled all the programmes as a mark of mourning.

On upcoming polls

The Minister claimed that the BJP, on its own, will win over 300 seats in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

"On the one hand, we have got a strong leader in Narendra Modi who has put India on the world map and is working to improve economic growth. On the other hand, the mega alliance of the Opposition parties is spurious and opportunistic," he said.

The Opposition alliance has no leader, no programme and had no clue know how to develop the country. All that they want is to remove Mr. Modi, who is for the development of the country, he added.
