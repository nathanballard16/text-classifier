An abusive husband found guilty of murdering his estranged wife and their two young children is due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey in London on Monday.

Mohammed Abdul Shakur, 46, spent years on the run after killing 26-year-old Juli Begum and daughters Anika and Thanha, aged five and six, on New Year's Day 2007.

Within a few days Shakur fled to his home country of Bangladesh to evade justice.

The former chef was eventually arrested in India in May 2013 before being extradited to the UK in April this year.

Shakur denied three counts of murder but declined to give evidence in his trial at the Old Bailey.

Last month, a jury found him guilty of murdering Ms Begum and their children at their home in East Ham, east London.

The court heard Shakur and Ms Begum had an arranged marriage in Bangladesh when Ms Begum was 19 but he was repeatedly violent towards his wife and did not like their children much because they were not boys.

During a sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey earlier this month, prosecutor Kerry Broome broke down in tears as she described how the murders had affected the victims' distraught family.

Shakur was remanded back into custody after the sentencing hearing was adjourned over confusion about how much time he had spent in custody in India.
