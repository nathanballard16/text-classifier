Uttar Pradesh [India], July 10 (ANI): The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday conducted raids at multiple locations across the state in connection with two separate cases related to alleged illegal mining scam, according to sources.

The agency recovered cash worth Rs 47 lakh from the residence of Bulandshahr District Magistrate Abhay Kumar Singh, Rs 10 lakh from Chief Development Officer Devi Sharan Upadhyay's residence and some documents related to properties from the premises of Director of Training and Employment, Vivek.
