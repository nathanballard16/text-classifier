Chennai: The city police on Monday night seized a huge quantity of foreign cigarettes and cash from a house in Triplicane here, and arrested a 31-year-old man in connection with the seizure.

Sources said, acting on a tip-off, Triplicane police carried out a raid in a house behind the Big Mosque and found 729 packets of Benson and Hedges cigarettes worth Rs. 7 lakh and Rs. 60,000 in cash.

Police said Jawahar Ali, of Devipattinam in Ramanathapuram was arrested from the spot. However, the owner of the smuggled consignment, Syyed Abudaheer (34) of Ashok Nagar in Chennai, was absconding.
