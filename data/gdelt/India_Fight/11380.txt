Watch: Varun Dhawan twerks on the sets of 'Street Dancer' leaving Shraddha Kapoor in splits

Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor have been shooting for Street Dancer 3D in London for quite some time. The duo has been teasing fans with BTS photos and videos from the sets leaving them excited for the dance flick. Street Dancer is a sequel to ABCD 2 and it marks the reunion of Varun and Shraddha after four years. The actors were loved for their cute chemistry in 2015 film, and they are leaving no stone unturned to impress everyone with their dancing skills.

We came across a BTS video from the sets of Street Dancer in London which is unmissable. In the video, Varun is seen twerking on the tunes of Bom Diggy song along with Nora Fatehi. Shraddha is seen enjoying the whole jig and her reaction is total fun. Varun is sporting a handsome look wearing an orange sweatshirt and blue jeans. Whereas Shraddha looked cute in a black jacket and blue denim shorts with a grey beanie.

Take a look at the video below:

Street Dancer is directed by Remo D'Souza and produced by T-Series. The film also stars Prabhudheva, Shakti Mohan and Nora Fatehi in pivotal roles. It is set to hit the screens on November 8, 2019.

The movie went on floors earlier this year in Amritsar and for the second schedule, the whole team headed to London. Before revealing the title Street Dancer, the makers called the film as 3.

Shraddha replaced Katrina Kaif in the film as the latter had to complete the shoot of Bharat.
