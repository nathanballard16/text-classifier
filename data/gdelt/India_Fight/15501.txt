Juvenile held for killing minor girl in east Delhi

The Delhi Police have arrested a 16-year-old boy for killing a minor girl due to a grudge against her over an incident for which he was reprimanded at a tuition class in east Delhi's Shahdara, a police officer said here on Sunday.

The victim's parents, resident of Naveen Shahdara, informed the police their 14-year-old daughter was missing. She had gone to meet her friend in noon but did not return till late evening.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Meghna Yadav said: "During investigation, the police spotted the boy in CCTV footage with the victim. Initially, he tried to mislead the police."

"He told the police they had gone to an ice-cream parlour together and later he returned home leaving the victim in the middle of way," Yadav said.

"But on sustained interrogation, he broke down and confessed the crime. He disclosed that he knew the victim through common tuition classes and later connected with her through Facebook messenger," she said.

"He was holding a grudge against her due to an incident at the tuition class for which he was reprimanded few days ago. He had planned to take revenge," the DCP said.

"As per the plan, the juvenile met the victim and took her for watching movie. After the movie, he took her to an isolated under construction building near Welcome Metro Station. He offered her a drink laced with drugs. When she got semi-conscious, he tied her with tape and strangled her to death," the officer said.

"Prima facie it was found that victim was not sexually assaulted although we are waiting for autopsy report," she said.
