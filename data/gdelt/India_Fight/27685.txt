Bandipora minor rape: Medical examination rules out rape

SRINAGAR: Medical examination of the three-year-old girl — who was allegedly kidnapped and raped in Sumbal village of Bandipora district earlier this month — has ruled out rape, stating that there was not enough evidence to suggest that she was sexually assaulted.In a report submitted to police, authorities of SKIMS medical college, Bemina , stated that there were no injury marks on any part of the minor’s body, including the private parts. “There was no active bleeding from the vagina or anus. The mere presence of the faint blood stains and maculopapular rash on the buttocks is not sufficient evidence to confirm sexual assault,” it read.The report added that the actual source of bleeding couldn’t be determined as there was no injury around the vaginal orifice. “There was no evidence of trauma, injury or bleeding in and around the vaginal orifice or anal opening. Maculopapular rash can arise due to multiple reasons,” it read. “Also, the blood stains were not dry blood but faint, stains only — almost negligible — and couldn’t be scrapped and sent for analysis,” it added.On May 11, the girl’s parents alleged that Tahir Ahmad Mir (20), a fellow villager, had kidnapped and raped her inside a school in the locality. Mir was arrested and booked under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 376 (rape) of the Ranbir Penal Code, even as his parents denied the allegation, claiming that the two families were involved in a financial dispute and the minor’s kin was framing Mir.A Special Investigation Team was formed to probe into the case. Based on its report, police filed a chargesheet on Saturday, within 17 days of the alleged crime.The case had triggered massive protests across Kashmir Valley, with people from all quarters setting aside their political and ideological differences and coming together to condemn the crime and demand exemplary punishment for the accused. In the ensuing violent clashes, one person died after being injured in police action.The J&K high court, which took suo motu cognizance of the crime on May 15, slated the hearing of the case to the last week of the month on May 17.
