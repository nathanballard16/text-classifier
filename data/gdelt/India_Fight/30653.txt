Bharat actor Chetan Rao works as a delivery guy when not shooting

It takes a lot of courage and perseverance to not only pursue your passion, but also to balance it successfully with your profession. Chetan Rao seems to be doing just that. The actor who has done small roles in highly-acclaimed projects like Bharat, Saavdhan India andDelhi Crime – when not shooting, works as a food delivery boy for a leading food app. With a dream of becoming a huge star one day, Chetan acts to feed his soul and works as a delivery guy to pay his bills. The scene came to light recently, when actor Rajesh Tailang recognised him while Chetan was delivering his order.

Rajesh took to Twitter and wrote: “Today the #swiggy delivery guy, who delivered food at my place is an actor and he did a cameo with me in #delhicrime . Whenever is not getting acting job, he does this. RESPECT.” This delivery guy was none other than Chetan, who had shared screen space with Rajesh in the recent Netflix Original series Delhi Crime.

Chetan lives in Kalyanpuri and acts when gets a chance. Thought he hardly gets much screen time, but according to him, it is enough to satisfy his hunger for acting. He always wanted to be an actor, but lacked the means to achieve his dream. A self-taught actor, Chetan says, he easily gets the small parts. Starting as a spot boy, he slowly started doing side roles. “I don’t earn much through side roles so I work as a delivery man to manage my expenses,” said Chetan to a leading daily.

Talking about people recognising him, he says he feels happy when people feel that they have seen him somewhere. What do you have to say about Chetan’s struggle? Do let us know in the comments section below. Also stay tuned to CineBlitz for more news and updates.
