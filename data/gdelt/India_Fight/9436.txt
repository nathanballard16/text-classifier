Indian air strikes in Pakistan: PM Modi meets three Service Chiefs; Masood Azhar confirms air strikes

New Delhi: The Indian Air Force (IAF) early Tuesday morning carried out air strikes at the biggest training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group in Pakistan, eliminating a number of terrorists and their trainers. The air strikes came 12 days after a JeM suicide bomber, Adil Ahmed Dar, rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into a bus ferrying CRPF jawans in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14, claiming the lives of 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel.

Addressing the media, Foreign Secretary Vijay K Gokhale said that the "non-military pre-emptive action was specifically targeted at the terrorist camp" located at Balakot, around 195 km from Islamabad.

Notably, the Pulwama attack was the worst ever attack on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan-based JeM had claimed responsibility for the gruesome attack. Amid calls to take revenge for the Pulwama attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently assured: “Is baar pura hisab lenge (We will settle the books in full this time)."
