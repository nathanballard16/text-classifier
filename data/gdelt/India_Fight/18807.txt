Irrfan recently made a comeback to Twitter and in a statement, he expressed his gratitude towards his fans for standing by him during his health crisis. "Maybe somewhere in the pursuit of winning, we forget how much it means to be loved. In our vulnerability, we are reminded. "As I leave my footprints onto these steps of my life, I want to pause to be grateful for receiving your immense love and support, it soothed me in my process of healing.

So I travel back to you, thanking you from the bottom of my heart," Irrfan wrote. The National Award-winning actor first spoke of his health on March 5, 2018, when he revealed that he was suffering from a "rare disease" but was yet to get a conclusive diagnosis.
