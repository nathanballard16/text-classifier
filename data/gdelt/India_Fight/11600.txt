UAE Partially Resumes Flights to Pakistan's Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar

This week, tensions between India and Pakistan flared up as the two countries engaged in an air battle and lost jets in it. It followed a strike by the Indian Air Force against what it said was a camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad, considered a terrorist group by India, located on the Pakistani soil across the so-called Line of Control (LoC) separating the Indian-and Pakistani-controlled parts of the Kashmir region.

The group, which used to perpetrate attacks in the Jammu and Kashmir state, is reportedly affiliated with Taliban movement and al-Qaeda terrorists and aims to separate Kashmir from India and to merge it into neighboring Pakistan.
