Military siege continues on 109th consecutive day in IOJ&K

In occupied Kashmir, unprecedented military seige and communications clamp down continue on the 109th consecutive day, today.

The residents of the Kashmir Valley and Muslim majority areas of Jammu and Ladakh regions continue to simmer with anger and anguish over India’s illegal move of stripping the special status of the territory.

As part of a silent protest against this move and India’s occupation, people in the Valley have been staying away from businesses, educational institutions and offices.
