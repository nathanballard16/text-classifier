The intelligence agencies on Wednesday shared an input that a large group of terrorists from Pakistan has infiltrated into the Indian territory in an around Punjab. The intelligence agencies had earlier said that the terrorists would try to launch an attack on the Indian security installations.

After fresh intelligence inputs suggested that a group of terrorists from Pakistan has infiltrated into India, the security agencies have put defence bases on orange alert. The defence bases in Pathankot, Jammu, Srinagar and Avantipura have been put on a high alert. An orange alert is just below the red alert.

"The defence bases in and around Punjab and Jammu are on high alert. The Indian Air Force has put its airbases in Punjab including Pathankot and Jammu on an orange alert," government sources told ANI.

"The inputs were received by forces today morning after which they are taking all precautions to protect the defence bases," they said.

There have been reports of a possible terror attack on major defence facilities since August 5 when the Centre moved to abrogate Article 370 that granted a special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

Late last month, intelligence agencies had issued a warning against a module of eight to ten Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists. The input suggests that the terror group may possibly try to carry out a suicide attack against air force bases in and around Jammu and Kashmir.

The Pathankot airbase was attacked by the Pakistani terrorists in 2016 when four Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists attacked the base before being eliminated by the security forces.
