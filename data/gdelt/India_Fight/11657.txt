New beginning for Yes Bank

AS Deutsche Bank AG veteran Ravneet Gill moves into the 27th floor of Yes Bank Ltd’s headquarters in downtown Mumbai, he brings the curtain down on one of the more colorful chapters in Indian finance.

His predecessor, founder and chief executive officer Rana Kapoor, built Yes into India’s fourth-largest private lender over 15 years until the central bank forced him out amid a controversy over bad-debt accounting. While Kapoor stepped aside as CEO in January, tensions between Yes and the regulator have persisted, and it now falls to Gill to ease them.
