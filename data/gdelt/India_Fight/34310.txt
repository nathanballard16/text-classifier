Mumbai: At least six people were killed and around 900,000 affected by floods in India's northeastern state of Assam, officials said Saturday.

"Nearly 900,000 people are affected in the recent wave of floods across 21 districts of the state," a local government official said. "So far six people have lost their lives in the flooding."

According to officials, several rivers including the Brahmaputra river, one of the largest rivers in the world, are flowing above danger due to incessant rains and water has inundated several places.

"At present, 68 relief camps are operational, where affected people have taken refuge," the official said. "Food items and drinking water bottles are being distributed among flood-hit people."

Apart from flooding, landslides have also been reported to have affected road and rail connectivity in several places.

"Train communication between Lumding and Silchar remains cut off due to landslide in Dima Hasao district and efforts are on to restore it," the official added.

Reports stated that floodwaters have entered Kaziranga National Park in Upper Assam, forcing wild animals to take shelter on platforms constructed for their safety during flood.

Kaziranga National Park is home to endangered one-horned rhinoceros.

Officials added that over 27,000 hectares of farmland are under floodwater.

Floods are an annual occurrence in Assam during the monsoon season.
