India can finish Pakistan with 20 atom bombs, admits Pervez Musharraf

New Delhi:

Former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf has warned its country that if Pakistan launches a nuclear bomb on India, the neighbouring country could "finish us by attacking with 20 atom bombs", according to Karachi-based newspaper Dawn.

Addressing a press conference in the UAE on Friday, Musharraf said: "Indian and Pakistan relations have again reached a dangerous level. There will be no nuclear attack. If we would attack India with one atomic bomb, then the neighbouring country could finish us by attacking with 20 bombs. Then the only solution is that we should first attack them with 50 atom bombs so that they cannot hit us with 20 bombs. Are you ready to first launch an attack with 50 bombs?"

Musharraf’s statement came days after 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a suicide attack by a terrorist of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama.

The former Pakistan dictator also claimed that Israel wanted to establish ties with Pakistan. The chief of All-Pakistan Muslim League (APML), who is leaving in self-exile in the UAE, said he was ready to return to Pakistan as he sees the political environment in his country favourable.

"In my opinion, the political environment is good and favourable. Half of the ministers are mine. Law minister and the attorney general were my lawyers," said Musharraf.

Musharraf also took pride that half of the ministers in the current government were a part of his cabinet. “The law minister is my own and the attorney general is my own lawyer,” he added. He, however, dismissed reports of critical illness and said. “An impression is being given that I am suffering with an illness owing to which I cannot move. I have no such issue.”
