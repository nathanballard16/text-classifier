Hera Pheri 3: Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty and Paresh Rawal starrer to witness a time jump; Read Details

One of the most popular franchises in Bollywood comedy films has undoubtedly been Hera Pheri. Efforts of the makers to reunite and kick off the third film in the franchise has taken some time now and as per latest reports we will have to wait a little longer than expected to watch the madness of Raju, Baburao Ganpatrao Apte and Shyam unravel on the screen. The director of the film has been switching back and forth and finally producer Firoz Nadiadwala has brought the original director Priyadarshan back on board.

According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Akshay Kumar, Suneil Shetty and Paresh Rawal will be a part of the franchise and their characters will play closer to their real ages. Suggesting that there will be a time leap, a source privy to the development told MM, "It takes off from from where Phir Hera Pheri ended, but fast-forwards into the present. The trip is desperate again but in a completely different scenario."

Meanwhile, Priyadarshan confirmed he is in talks with the cast and producer Firoz but it will be a while before he begins filming the comedy. He said, "I am currently busy with my Malayalam film, Marakkar: The Lion of Arabian Sea. It is a huge film and I will only think about Hera Pheri after this one is out of my system. Nothing is concrete as yet."

On the other hand, Akshay Kumar is busy with multiple projects. After delivering a hit with Kesari, the actor is currently shooting for Good News opposite Kareena Kapoor Khan. This year, he will also be seen in Housefull 4. So, it might take a while before the actor puts Hera Pheri on his schedule.
