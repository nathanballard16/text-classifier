Candlelight procession at Rongjeng against killing of CRPF men

TURA: Citizens of Rongjeng, a remote town in East Garo Hills bordering West Khasi Hills, turn up in large numbers on Monday evening to join a silent candlelight procession to express solidarity with the families of the CRPF jawans who were killed in the terror attack in Kashmir last week. Led by the A’chik Students Welfare Association, the citizens observed two minutes of silence and walked in a silent procession holding candles.

The people of Rongjeng have joined the rest of the country in unity against terror and actively took part in Monday’s Bharat Bandh. The people of Rongjeng have had a bitter experience with terror for close to two decades. Their region was once badly impacted by tribal militancy with outfits like ANVC and GNLA clashing with security forces resulting in multiple loss of lives.
