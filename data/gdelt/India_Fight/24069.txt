Man arrested in connection with attempt to murder case

A suspected member of the Anil Dujana gang, who was involved in an attempt to murder case in Delhi, was arrested, police said Sunday.

The accused was identified as 25-year-old Vikas Kasana, a resident of Mayur Vihar, they said.

On Friday, police said they arrested Arvind Kumar (32) on April 29 from Vellore in Tamil Nadu. Kumar was wanted in over 11 cases and was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000, they said.

Kasana was arrested Saturday from near the DDA Park in east Delhi's Kondli where he came to meet his associate. A semi-automatic pistol with four cartridges and a motorcycle were seized from him, they added.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ram Gopal Naik said that both Kasana and Kumar were involved in the attack on their rival gang member Sandeep Nagar, who was a witness in a murder case.

The attack took place on July 30, 2018 and Nagar was shot in the abdomen. The motive of the accused was to deter Nagar from deposing against members of their gang in the murder case, Naik said.

Kasana was involved in more than half a dozen cases of murder and attempt to murder in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, police said.

Earlier, 10 persons were arrested during the time when Kumar and Kasana were absconding, police added.
