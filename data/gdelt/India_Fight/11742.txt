Pakistan returns captured pilot to India

Pakistan released on Friday a captured Indian fighter pilot in a move many hope will ease tensions between the two countries. Deutsche Welle reported.

Thousands of Indians, some waving flags and singing, had gathered at the Wagah border crossing near the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore before the pilot crossed into India shortly before 9 p.m. local time (1600 UTC).

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured on Wednesday. The Pakistani military said it shot down his and another Indian fighter plane after they crossed the Kashmir boundary known as the Line of Control and intruded into Pakistani airspace for a second time this week.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had on Thursday called the decision to release the pilot a "peace gesture." The decision to release the pilot came after countries including the United States and China, as well as the European Union, urged India and Pakistan to de-escalate the conflict.
