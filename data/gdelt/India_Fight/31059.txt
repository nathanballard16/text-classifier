India Kicks Off $6.5 Bn Submarine Project With Help From Abroad

All six submarines under this project will be built in India by the selected Indian Strategic Partner in collaboration with the selected foreign submarine manufacturer.

The Indian Navy also retained the option to “manufacture six more submarines under the project”.

Companies interested in the project are expected to respond to the announcement within two months. The lowest bidder will be selected as the winner of the mega project.

The Indian Navy has stipulated, in its draft request of information, indigenous content of 45%, additionally mandating that the submarines should be fitted with Indian steel, missiles, torpedoes including the indigenously developed heavy weight torpedo and air independent propulsion. The navy also wants all copyrights for the submarine to be vested to India once the initial batch of 6 submarines has been constructed so India can export the vessel.

The Indian Navy presently operates 14 conventionally-powered submarines, two nuclear ballistic missile submarines, and a Russian-built nuclear powered fast attack submarine.
