Lok Sabha Election 2019, Daman and Diu profile: Congress set for a tough battle with BJP holding seat for two consecutive terms-Politics News , Firstpost

Spread over a mere 111 square kilometres, this is the second smallest Union Territory after Lakshadweep.

The Daman and Diu Union Territory has a lone Lok Sabha constituency and Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Lalubhai Patel is the sitting MP from here. Patel has been elected for two consecutive terms and is going for a third attempt this election.

Spread over a mere 111 square kilometres, this is the second smallest Union Territory after Lakshadweep. The Union Territory has only two districts—Daman and Diu—of which Daman is larger. It is adjacent to the southern tip of Gujarat. After having been under the Portuguese rule for more than four centuries, the Union Territory was under Portuguese rule as recently as 1961. It then became a part of the Goa, Daman and Diu Union Territory. However, when Goa attained statehood, the Union Territory of Daman and Diu came into existence.

Daman and Diu have traditionally seen bipolar elections since the beginning between BJP and Congress. While BJP has fielded incumbent Lalubhai Patel, the Congress has decided to give candidate Ketan Patel as a second chance. In the 2014 elections, Lalubhai had defeated Ketan by a mere 9,222 votes.
