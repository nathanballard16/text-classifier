Avengers: Endgame: Mark Ruffalo and Chris Evans REVEAL who was the most emotional on the last day of shoot

Avengers: Endgame is a movie every MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) fan is impatiently waiting for. After a year of witnessing the heartbreaking Avengers: Infinity War (2018), which wiped out half the universe and some of our beloved superheroes as well, Avengers: Endgame will see how the remaining ones fight tooth and nail to avenge and bring back the fallen. For some of the superheroes, Avengers: Endgame could be the last time we see them in an MCU film. This includes members of the OG 6 (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner).

Recently, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Evans had been paired for the interviews in LA to promote their upcoming movie. During the interview with Associated Press, The Hulk and Captain America were asked as to who was the most emotional on the last day of shooting of Avengers: Endgame. To this, Mark revealed, "That was probably Scarlett. She usually gets really emotional." Chris added, "I was pretty teary-eyed. It has nothing to do with the plot. It's just the fact that it's the culmination of a really long endeavour. It wraps up the journey for a lot of the characters."

However, The Russo Brothers (Joe Russo, Anthony Russo) disagreed and stated that Scarlett did not get emotional. On the other hand, Don Cheadle quipped that Ruffalo got emotional which earned a chuckle out of Chris Hemsworth and Brie Larson.
