Mumbai: One person has died and 14 have been rescued while several are still feared trapped after a fire broke out on the third floor of Churchill Chamber building on Merryweather Road near Taj Mahal hotel in Colaba in Mumbai.

According to reports, fire-fighters are at the spot and rescue operation is underway. The fire was first reported at 12:20 pm and was declared Level 2 around 12:30 pm. The cause of the fire is not known yet.

In dramatic visuals from the spot, firefighters in heavy gear can be seen climbing up a steel ladder and spraying water from a third-floor window of the building as black smoke billowed out from the windows.

The Mumbai fire department was recently in the news after it inducted a robot capable of dousing the fire. Reportedly, the robot can enter narrow lanes and its technology enables it to detect the exact source of the fire.

"The best part of this technology is that within two or three days, anybody can understand it. It is not very sophisticated or perishable kind of robot," Chief Fire Officer Prabhat Rangdale told Mirror Now.

In May in Surat, 22 students had died after a fire broke out at a coaching centre located on the fourth floor of the Takshashila Arcade in Sarthana area. Most of the students who were killed in the fire were between the ages of 14 and 17. Some were expecting their Class 12 results.
