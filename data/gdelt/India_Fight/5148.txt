Father-daughter killed after dumper rams into house

Kolkata, Feb 9 : A man and his daughter were killed after a dumper truck lost control and rammed into their house in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district, police said on Saturday.

The incident took place in district's Shayamnagar village early on Friday.

"A dumper truck allegedly lost control and rammed into the house of Maidul Islam, 48, in Shayamnagar. He died on the spot. Later his daughter Asifa Islam, 17, was declared dead at a local hospital," an officer from Kashipur police station said.

"It is not sure whether the accident happened due to over-speeding or any mechanical failure in the dumper. The vehicle has been seized but the driver and the helper of the dumper have fled the spot," he said.

Following the incident, an angry mob agitated with the dead body of Islam and blocked parts of the adjoining Haora road after half an hour before they were dispersed.
