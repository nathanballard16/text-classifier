Roger Stone compares FBI raid at his Fort Lauderdale to bin Laden, El Chapo

SEALs breached doors and cleared each level of the al-Qaeda leader’s stronghold in a battle that went on for about 40 minutes. One commando killed bin Laden’s sons near the top of the building, and two women were tackled by a SEAL who feared they were wearing suicide vests, according to one of the men on the mission who spoke to Esquire and was later identified as Robert O’Neill.
