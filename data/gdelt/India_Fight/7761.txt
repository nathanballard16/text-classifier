SC to hear plea seeking CBI probe in murder of BJP workers in West Bengal

New Delhi [India], Feb 20 (ANI): Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a plea filed to demand a CBI probe into the murder of three BJP workers in West Bengal.

The apex court is hearing a petition filed by BJP leader and lawyer Gaurav Bhatia, who sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the matter.

During Tuesday’s hearing, Supreme Court lawyer Gaurav Bhatia had argued for a CBI investigation of the murders.

“The brutal murder of three WB BJP workers is a fit case for CBI probe and if this case is not fit for a detailed investigation by CBI, then no case comes under the ambit of CBI probe”, argued Bhatia.

On May 30, an 18-year-old BJP worker named Tirlochan Mahato was found hanging from a tree in Purulia's Balarampur district. After this incident, another BJP worker, Dulal Kumar was found dead in a similar manner in the same district.

On July 28, one more BJP leader, Shaktipada Sardar was hacked in West Bengal's Diamond Harbour area.

The deaths of three BJP leaders had sparked an outrage in the state with the BJP blaming the Trinamool Congress for the attack. (ANI)
