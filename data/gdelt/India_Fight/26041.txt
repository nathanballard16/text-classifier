Chandra Babu Responds on Joining Hands with TRS:- AP Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu staged an attack on BJP and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He deferred with Modi and walked out of NDA alliance some time ago. BJP has been struggling to make an impact in AP and there are speculations that YSRCP Chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy has been approached to take on Chandra Babu in Andhra Pradesh. Babu yesterday met the Chief Election Commissioner in New Delhi and he spoke to the media slamming BJP and the Election Commission for joining hands.

He was asked if Chandra Babu is ready to join hands with TRS in forming the alliance after which Babu said that he is ready to join hands with any party against BJP. "Don't be so hypothetical. We are fighting against BJP. Hence we are ready to join hands with any party and we are not bothered about our past record. Me and KCR are different people and have different ideologies. We are not enemies and we will work together if the Telugu states are benefited" said Chandra Babu.
