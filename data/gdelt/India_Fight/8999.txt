Mumbai: PhD scholar arrested for filming men taking bath

A PhD scholar has been arrested for allegedly filming men while bathing. Avinash Kumar was caught in his voyeuristic pursuits when he accidentally used the flash on his mobile phone while recording his neighbours’ ablutions. An ID card recovered from the 34-year-old showed he is pursuing his PhD from IIT-Bombay.

Kumar, a resident of Bihar, moved into an apartment at Dev-Ashish Housing Society on Kolshet Road in Thane 10 months ago with his wife.

As per the FIR lodged with Kapurbawdi police, a resident of the building, spotted a mobile phone panning towards her bathroom window. She raised an alarm and rushed to the passage where she spotted a scared Kumar. Her husband demanded Kumar’s phone, in which he found a video clip of himself taking a bath.

Kumar tried to flee but was cornered by the other residents. In his phone, they found clips of many other male neighbours taking baths.

The residents then dragged Kumar to Kapurbawdi police station and lodged a complaint on behalf of many residents.

Further investigation revealed that he would transfer the clips to Google drives through four email ids. “Footage from our CCTV network showed Kumar coolly walking up to the first floor and then rushing down,” said Ramkripal Gupta, chairman of the society, adding, “There was even a clip of a young girl. We suspect he is a habitual offender and shares the clips on the Internet.”

On his Facebook profile, Kumar says he has done MTech from IIT-Delhi and is currently doing PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT-Bombay.

Kumar has been booked under IPC Section 354C (voyeurism) which entails a maximum punishment of up to three years if convicted.
