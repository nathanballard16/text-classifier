Madhya Pradesh BJP leader Manoj Thackeray found dead in field

Manoj Thackeray, a BJP leader from Balwadi in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwai, was found dead in a field early in the morning on Sunday.

Balwadi is about 160 km from Indore.

His body was found in a field in Warla Police Station’s limits. Manoj Thackeray had left home for a morning walk early today.

The police have found a blood-stained rock from the crime site and believe that Manoj Thackeray was killed with that rock. “We are investigating the matter,” ASP Balwadi said.

Further details are awaited.

Thackeray is the second BJP leader to be killed in a week in Madhya Pradesh after Prahlad Bandhwar was shot dead on January 17 in Mandsaur.

Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleged that was a conspiracy behind the murder and demanded a probe by the CBI. .

Former MP CM SS Chouhan: Govt is taking this lightly. There seems to be a larger conspiracy behind this (BJP leader killed in Mandsaur). I demand a CBI inquiry. BJP leader was killed in Barwani, I warn the govt that they stop such incidents otherwise BJP will come out on streets. https://t.co/e7v2qS0WdV — ANI (@ANI) January 20, 2019
