Baby snatched from cot and decapitated by leopard as mum sleeps through attack

A leopard decapitated a baby after snatching him from his cot.

The animal is believed to have dragged nine-month-old Dhaval Rathwa by his teeth while he was sleeping beside his mum at around 4am on Tuesday.

But his mother slept through the attack as the leopard sprinted off, and the child's decapitated body was found by locals the next day.

According to Times Now, forest rangers were able to capture the animal nearly 24 hours after the deadly attack in the village of Zari, India.

It is being kept under observation at the forest departments' rescue centre in Pavagadh.

The leopard was captured close to where the boy's decapitated body was found the day before.

Trap cages with baits inside them were placed in the area to lure the animal into the cage, before it could attack other villagers.

Deputy conservator of forest of the area, Nilesh Pandya told Times of India that the boy's father will be given Rs 4 lakh (£4,400) in compensation for the death of his child.
