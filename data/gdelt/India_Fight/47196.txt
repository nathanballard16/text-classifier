Congress slams Nirmala Sitharaman over PMC scam

New Delhi: Accusing Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of being ‘insensitive’ towards the general public while referring to the plight of the people affected by the PMC bank case, the Congress Saturday launched a fresh attack on her.

“When government wants to snatch away contingency buffer from the RBI they have no issues, but when common man needs his/her money, the government says it cannot issue directions to the RBI,” Anand Sharma, senior spokesperson of the Congress said, while referring to Sitharaman’s meeting with the PMC bank’s affected customers in Mumbai.

“This government has no sensitivity for the general public, it is insensitive,” Sharma added. He said that instead of working on improving the economic conditions and safeguarding the depositors’ interest, the government is working with ‘vendetta in mind’ and is focused on targeting political opponents.

“The government is obsessed with targeting its political opponents, it is working with vendetta in mind,” Sharma said. Sitharaman had met a group of angry customers of the cooperative bank in Mumbai on Thursday. While trying to assure them, she had told them that she will talk to the RBI Governor and convey their distress. She also told them that the Ministry of Finance may not have anything to do with it directly because the RBI was the regulator. On Wednesday, the PMC bank customers had protested outside a Mumbai court also.
