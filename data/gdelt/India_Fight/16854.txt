Rahul Gandhi promises Rs 72,000 per year to 25 crore poor people if Congress voted to power

In the wake of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday came up with possibly his biggest pre-poll claim by giving a gist of his party's minimum income scheme for benefiting the poor of the nation. Addressing a press conference at New Delhi, the Congress president said that if the grand old party is voted to power in the 2019 general elections, they won't leave any stone unturned to eradicate poverty from the nation. Gandhi added it would be a first of sorts in India's political history, that a Union government shall provide Rs 72,000 per annum to the 20 per cent poorest families in the country. Gandhi said that the party had worked out the financial details as to how to fund the scheme. He termed as the scheme as the Second MGNREGA. The Congress chief exuded confidence that the scheme was bound to benefit five crore poor families and 25 crore people in all.
