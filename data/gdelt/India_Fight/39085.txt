Spoiled Brat Drives BMW Into River Because He Didn't Get A Jaguar

Meet Akash, as he's known locally in the Yamunanagar, Haryana in northern India. He's an adult, supposedly, and an extremely spoiled one at that. You know what, scratch that. He's just a man-child, and here's why. Fox News reports he allegedly pushed the new BMW, an F30 3 Series, his parents bought him into a river because it was "too small" for him and his friends. Stuff like this can't be made up. Instead of the BMW 3 Series, Akash really wanted a Jaguar. Poor guy.

After pushing the BMW into the water, the only way for state authorities to retrieve it was by using a crane. The local police have even opened an investigation. There were even eyewitnesses who saw the young man hop out of the car just prior to it reaching deeper water.
