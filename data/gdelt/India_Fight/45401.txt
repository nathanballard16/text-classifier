NEW YORK: Prime Minister Imran Khan’s UNGA speech has ‘resonated among the masses because he spoke with heart’, this is how a senior Pakistani journalist based in the US described the historic address of the prime minister.

Masood Haider, who has covered many Pakistani leaders at the UN, shared his observation with German broadcaster DW about the PM’s speech at the global forum.

“His words resonated with the people of Pakistan because he spoke with heart and intense emotion. There was nothing artificial and this what the people wanted,” said Haider.

“Whomever I met here and talked to is pleased with PM Imran,” he added.

In his over 45-minute maiden speech to the UNGA, PM Imran lashed out at Indian Prime Minister Narendra for annexing occupied Kashmir and imposing a repressive lockdown, with phone and internet services cutoff, thousands arrested, medical supplies running short and schools closed.

Speaking about the prevailing situation in the valley, the prime minister had said Pakistan would fight till the end if India imposed war in case of any Pulwama-like situation in the valley.

He said there will be bloodbath once curfew is lifted in the occupied valley.

“There are 900,000 troops there, they haven’t come to, as Narendra Modi says — for the prosperity of Kashmir… These 900,000 troops, what are they going to do? When they come out? There will be a bloodbath,” PM Imran said.

The prime minister was lauded for taking a bold stance on issues hurting the Muslim world. Social media was flooded with praise for him as he gave his speech on Friday.
