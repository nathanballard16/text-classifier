South Indian multi-lingual actor Prakash Raj filed his nomination to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Bangalore Central constituency as an Independent. Raj, 53, who hails from this tech city, is a popular actor in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films. "National parties like BJP and Congress have failed the people. I would like to be the voice of the people," Raj told the media after filing his nomination. The actor will be contesting from the seat against BJP's outgoing MP P.C. Mohan, who too filed his nomination from Bangalore Central seat on Friday. The Congress is yet to announce its candidate from the constituency. Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced its support to Prakash Raj. He visited Ali Shah Dargah and offered prayers before filing his nominations papers for the upcoming Lok Sabha election. Raj has in January announced that he will not join any political party and will contest the Lok Sabha polls from Bengaluru Central as an Independent. Raj is known for his anti-BJP stance and has been very vocal in seeking justice for journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead outside her residence. Karnataka will vote to elect its members of Parliament during the second and third phases of polling on April 18 and April 23, respectively. The counting of votes will take place on May 23. (BCCL)
