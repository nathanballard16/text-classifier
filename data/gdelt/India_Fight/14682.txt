Two Pakistan jets detected close to LoC

Two Pakistani fighter aircraft were monitored flying very close to Indian territory near Jammu and Kashmir late last night.

Their aircraft were monitored closely by the Indian Air Force that has been keeping a close watch of the area.

The planes were flying at high speed and even broke the sound barrier in the area causing panic.

Speaking at the Aaj Tak security summit on Tuesday, former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal AY Tipnis said the Indian Air Force needed more squadrons and if the IAF had Rafale, it would have destroyed half of Pakistan's fighter jets.

"The aim of the 24 Pakistan jets was to attack Srinagar, Awantipora base. If India had Rafale at that time, IAF would have destroyed at least 12 of them. Rafale will boost the morale of IAF," Air Marshal AY Tipnis said.

Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said India has "exposed" Pakistan's nuclear bluff by carrying out airstrikes to eliminate Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot on February 26, reported news agency IANS.

FM Jaitley said India has fought several wars with Pakistan including 1965, 1971 and during the Kargil conflict. "Since then, Pakistan's army has realised that because of our huge economy and superior military strength, conventional wars cannot be won," he said.
