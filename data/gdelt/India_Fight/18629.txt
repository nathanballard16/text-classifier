Chennai: Father of wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman Air Marshal (retd) Simhakutty Vardhaman has said that the Spice 2000 bombs fired at the Balakot Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) camp, could have killed about 250- 300 terrorists. Interacting with students of IIT Madras on Wednesday, Vardhaman said that the air strike took place when targets were inside the Balakot camp which resulted in killing a large number of terrorists.

According to a report in Times of India, Air Marshal Vardhaman countered the argument — that the structure hit by the IAF bombs was not damaged — by saying that the fuse of the bombs was delayed to ensure maximum casualties.

He further said that the IAF deceived the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) by launching seven aircraft towards Bahawalpur, the headquarters of Jaish e Mohammed and launching a simultaneous attack on Balakot. He added that Pakistan was in a state of high alert in light of the Pulwama attack and was anticipating an attack from India, but they did not realise when IAF entered their territory.

Adding that the details of the operation will be out in a few months, Vardhaman said that this was the first time IAF crossed the border since 1971. He further said that the government had already clarified that the attack was a 'preemptive non-military' strike against the JeM installations in Pakistan.

Wing commander Abhinandan, who brought down an F-16 aircraft of PAF, was captured by Pakistan and later returned to India following massive diplomatic pressure on Islamabad.
