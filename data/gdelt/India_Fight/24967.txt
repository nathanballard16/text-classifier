Two Lashkar-e-Taiba militants were killed in a brief pre-dawn encounter with security forces in South Kashmir’s Shopian district on Sunday. At least 10 youth were injured in clashes which occurred after the encounter started in the Hend-Sitapur area of the district.

A J&K Police spokesperson said a cordon and search operation was launched in the morning, and while underway, the militants fired at the security forces, triggering an encounter.

The two militants have been identified as Javid Ahmad Bhat and Adil Bashir Wani, both residents of Kulgam district. Police said both militants were affiliated with the LeT. Police said Bhat was responsible for recruiting youth from adjoining areas of Kulgam to join the militant outfit, and several cases were registered against Wani.

After the encounter began, some youth stone pelted the security forces, leading to clashes. “We received 10 youth with pellet injuries. Seven of them were referred to Srinagar hospital for further treatment. The injured youth were brought to different hospitals and those referred to Srinagar had pellet injuries on eyes,” Dr Fazil Ali Kochak, the Chief Medical Officer of Kulgam district told The Indian Express.
