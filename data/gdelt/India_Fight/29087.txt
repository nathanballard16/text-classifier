Admissions a worry, say experts, city students

With pass percentage of the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams falling to 77.04 from 90.41 in 2018 in the Mumbai division, students and experts fear that college admissions could be a tough battle for SSC students against those from other boards.

The Mumbai division slipped to the fifth position in the State this year. Of the 3,734 schools in the division, 41 reported a dismal pass percentage between 0 and 10%, while 781 schools recorded 90% and above and 331 schools 100%.

Within the division, the Mumbai suburban region 1 stood first with a pass percentage of 79.59, closely followed by Thane at 78.55. Greater Mumbai region recorded 77.81%, while Raigad stood at 76.78% and Mumbai suburban region 2 at 76.06%. The Palghar region fared the worst at 71.75%.

Schools run by the Brihanmumbai Muncipal Corporation recorded a pass percentage of 53.14. Two of the 210 civic schools recorded a 100% result, while 12 recorded 90% and more.

Out of the 3,57,055 students who appeared for the exam in the division, 2,75,071 students cleared it with flying colours. While 57,284 students scored a distinction and 90,426 students scored a first class, 90,426 and 35,830 students secured second and third class respectively.

Krisha Shah from Divine Child school (99.2%), Sahil Vedpathak from St. Lawrence High School (98.6%) and Sancia D’Sa from Mary Immaculate Girls High School (97%) were among the top scorers in Mumbai. All three aspire to pursue Science.

For Krisha, consistently following the set agenda and understanding concepts during preparation helped her ace the exam. “I went off social media this year and put my focus entirely on studies for six to seven hours a day,” she said.

Sahil, who aspires to crack the IIT entrance exam, said his mantra was to not stress about studies and prepare from Day 1 with full concentration.

Sancia attributed her success to her teacher Jacinta Candes, who taught her English and strengthened her foundation since Class VIII, enabling her to score 100/100 in English. “I never used a phone till Class X. I balanced extracurricular activities with studies and I now aspire to become an engineer,” she said.

Experts are worried that the low pass percentage would mean that students of other boards like ICSE and CBSE might have an edge over the SSC students in getting good colleges, keeping cut-offs in mind.

Suresh Nair, principal, Vivek Vidyalaya and Junior College, said the internal marks being scrapped and the changes to the syllabus and paper pattern could have affected the scores. “While other boards are liberalising their correction process, the SSC board has made it stricter. Students and teachers could not even refer to question papers of the previous years,” he said.

Ophelia Barreto, principal, Podar School, said internal marks helped students get good scores. “With those gone, appearing for a 100-mark paper was an added challenge for students.”
