New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday carried out raids at the premises of notable lawyers Indira Jaising and her husband Anand Grover husband in connection with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) violation case.

The searches were at the Delhi and Mumbai offices of their NGO and homes as well, the police said. Officials did not give any details of locations, they said.

Supreme Court advocate Indira Jaising said, "Mr Grover and I are being targetted for the human rights work that we have done over the years."

In May, the Supreme Court had issued notices to advocates Indira Jaising and Anand Grover and their NGO Lawyers' Collective while hearing a petition filed by petitioner Lawyer's Voice seeking status of investigations into an alleged case of FCRA violation by the NGO.

Earlier, Grover was booked by the CBI for alleged FCRA violations in receiving foreign aid. When contacted, Grover asked not to be disturbed as he was in the "midst" of it (searches). Lawyers Collective had denied all charges levelled by the CBI.
