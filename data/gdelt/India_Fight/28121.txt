New Delhi: Five youths from Kashmir Valley who had joined different terror outfits shunned the path of violence due to the timely intervention of their families and the police.

Youths in the Valley started picking up arms after the commander of Hizbul Mujahideen Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter with the security forces in 2016.

Wani’s death galvanised the youths in the Valley and huge protests were staged there.

However, after the killing of dreaded terrorist and leader of Al Qaeda affiliate Ansar Gazwatul Hind Zakir Musa, the youths are expected to pick up arms once again. Musa was a close associate of Burhan Wani.

As per the statement made by Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh, 257 terrorists were killed across Jammu and Kashmir in 2018. Asserting that counter-insurgency operations would continue in 2019, Singh advised the youths to shun violence and also appealed to their parents to ensure the same.

Recently the Jammu and Kashmir DGP claimed that the number of locals joining terrorist organisations came down to half.

As per the data shared with the media, the DGP further said that there are around 275 active terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir including over 100-125 from foreign countries.

"The number of local terrorists is decreasing every year. In the last five and a half months, only 40 locals joined terrorism which is less than half compared to the previous records,” said Singh.

On the issue of infiltration from across the border, he said that the number is also coming down considerably.

Most of the new recruits from the Valley come from the restive South Kashmir region and many youths joining terror ranks come from districts like Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag.

Terror outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen and the Lashkar-e-Taiba are the top recruiters in the Valley.
