But Bhat’s brother refused to take the body, saying it was charred beyond recognition.Khan’s body has been taken by his family members, the officers said. A lesser-known Jaish terrorist, Khan, 23, was an electrician with a graduate degree and lived in Mir Mohalla, Tral. He joined JeM in 2017 as an overground worker and eventually became a key IED handler. Noor Mohammed Tantrey, alias Noor Trali, who is believed to have played a role in the terror group’s revival in Kashmir Valley, had allegedly taken Khan under his wings and groomed him.The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the Pulwama attack, carried out searches at Khan’s residence on February 27. “Mudasir had been in constant contact with suicide attacker Adil Ahmed Dar, who rammed his explosive-laden explosives into the CRPF convoy. He, along with Adil and three others, had trained for suicide attacks. He also played a key role in offering logistics for the attack,” said an NIA officer.The eldest son of a labourer, Khan is also believed to be involved in the terror strike at the army camp in Sunjawan in February 2018, in which six personnel and a civilian were killed. His role had come under lens in the Lethpora attack on a CRPF camp in January 2018 that left five jawans dead.Police records say that the two slain terrorists were affiliated with proscribed terror outfit JeM and were wanted for their complicity in a series of terror crimes, including attack on security establishments. A stash of arms and ammunition, including assault rifles, were recovered from the encounter spot.Security forces had launched a cordon and search operation in Pinglish after receiving intelligence about the presence of militants in the area. The operation turned into an encounter after the militants opened fire at the search party who retaliated.Lt General Dhillon said ever since the February attack, 18 militants have been killed in various actions by security forces.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A youth was arrested with two grenades from outside an Army camp in J&K’s Poonch on Monday.
