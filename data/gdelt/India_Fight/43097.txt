JKLF's Yasin Malik to be tried in killing of IAF personnel: All you need to know

* Earlier this month, the Jammu TADA court had issued non-bailable warrants against the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief Malik and asked the police to produce him before the court on September 11.* On January 25, 1990, Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna and his three colleagues had been shot dead, allegedly by a group of militants led by Malik, in Rawalpora on the outskirts of Srinagar. Malik is the alleged perpetrator behind the terror attack.* Eyewitnesses later told police that Khanna had taken the brunt of the attack while trying to cover his colleagues from heavy automatic weapon firing by the car-borne militants.* Malik is also accused of orchestrating the kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed — the daughter of the then Union home minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed in 1989.* In 1995, Malik was granted a stay on trial by a single bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court as there was no TADA court in Srinagar.* In 2008, Malik approached the special court saying the trial could be shifted to Srinagar as he was facing a lot of security problems in view of the Amarnath Yatra row -- an agitation which had divided people of Kashmir and Jammu on religious lines over the issue of leasing land to outsiders during the annual pilgrimage.* On April 26, a bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court struck down the 2008 single-bench High Court court order transferring the hearing in the two cases to Srinagar.* Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief Malik is currently lodged in Delhi's Tihar Jail after being arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in a case related to the financing of terror and separatist organisations.
