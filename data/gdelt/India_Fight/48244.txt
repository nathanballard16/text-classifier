5 Pakistani soldiers killed in Indian Army retaliatory firing along LoC

New Delhi: In a major retaliation to Pakistan’s unprovoked firing, the Indian Army launched Sunday heavy artillery attacks targeting at least four terror camps and several Pakistani military positions opposite the Tangadhar sector along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, killing five Pakistani soldiers, government sources here said.

There have been reports of killing of at least four-five terrorists in the shelling by the Indian Army, which inflicted significant damage on the Pakistani side.

The counter-offensive came as two Indian Army personnel and a civilian were killed in Pakistani firing, Saturday evening.

An Indian Army official said Pakistani army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violations to assist infiltration by terrorists into Indian territory in Tangadhar sector Saturday evening.

“As a result calibrated escalation of area weapons was undertaken by the Indian side in which terrorist launch pads and several Pakistan army posts giving incidental protection to these launch pads and certain gun positions were hit,” the official said.

The official asserted that the Indian Army retain the right to respond at a time and place of its choosing in case Pakistan army continue to assist terrorist activities from across Indian borders.

The sources said the pounding of Pakistani positions and terror camps cannot in any way be compared to surgical strikes carried out by the Indian Army in September 2016 on terror launch pads across the Line of Control.

Meanwhile, Pakistan army said Sunday that at least nine Indian soldiers were killed and several injured in the fierce exchange of fire across the Line of Control (LoC), but Indian Army sources rejected the claim.

Pakistan military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor tweeted that Pakistan also lost one soldier and three civilians in the skirmishes.
