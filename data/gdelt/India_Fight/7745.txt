Fire safety norm violation: HC asks govt, civic bodies to reply

Plea seeks compensation to kin of Karol Bagh fire victims

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought the response of the AAP government and the three municipal corporations here on a plea for immediate action against hotels or guest houses flouting fire safety and other norms.

A Bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V.K. Rao issued notice to the Delhi government and the three corporations, seeking their response on a plea demanding payment of compensation to the families of those who died in the fire.

Strict action

The plea referred to the recent fire at a hotel in Karol Bagh here that claimed 17 lives, while seeking directions to the Delhi government and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to take strict action against the officials whose negligence resulted in the incident.

The plea further urged that authorities should frame and implement a policy for periodic inspection of all community halls, hotels and guest houses in the Capital.

The application was filed in a petition against the running of illegal community or banquet halls in the Capital.

‘Negligent’ authorities

During the brief hearing, the petitioner said that inaction of the authorities has led to the incident in question and if steps were not taken, a major catastrophe may occur.

The Bench directed the Delhi government and the corporations to indicate their stand before the next date of hearing on March 13.
