All-Time Great Helicopters That Have Served the Country

HAL Dhruv ALH: The Dhruv ALH is a helicopter developed and manufactured by the HAL and entered service in 2002. The indigenous ALH fleet in IAF has steadily grown from conventional ALH Mk-I to state of the art 'Glass' cockpit ALH Mk-III. This helicopter is a twin-engine machine that can carry 14 passengers with two pilots and has a cruise speed of 250 km/hr. It is also used by the Sarang Helicopter Display Team, apart from SAR, Cas Evac, and RTR operations. There's also an attack variant of the HAL Dhruv called HAL Rudra. (Image: AP)
