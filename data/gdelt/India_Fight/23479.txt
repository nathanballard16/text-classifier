Indian troops arrest 44 youth in crackdown in Shopian, Pulwama

In occupied Kashmir, Indian troops have arrested at least 44 youth during the ongoing massive crackdown in Shopian and Pulwama districts.

According to Kashmir Media Service, the troops and police personnel during night raids arrested 38 persons from Tahab and Chewakalan areas of Pulwama and six from Vehil and Narwah areas of Shopian.

Pulwama and Shopian districts are scheduled to go for polls on Monday during the final phase of the so-called Indian Parliamentary elections in occupied Kashmir and the last leg of the three-phased polls being held for the Islamabad constituency of the Lok Sabha.

Over forty youth have been detained by the Indian forces since last week during nocturnal raids in the two districts.

Meanwhile, senior APHC leader and the Chairman of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir, Muhammad Ashraf Sehrai, has strongly condemned the arrests of youth by Indian forces in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

In a statement in Srinagar, he said, India is pushing the Kashmiri youth to the wall and have created a sense of insecurity in the occupied territory.

He said, India is continuing to ignore the basic reality and ground situation in Kashmir which will ultimately result in escalating crises and unrest.
