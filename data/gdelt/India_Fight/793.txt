Father-son duo held for sandalwood smuggling

BENGALURU: In a pre-dawn raid, a 100-member team of armed policemen led by two deputy commissioners (DCPs) stormed Kattigenahalli village near Hoskote and arrested a father-son duo involved in smuggling sandalwood and red sanders. The team was split into three groups,” said Ahad, adding, “We surrounded the house from all sides. Syed Riyaz , 49, and his son Syed Sher Ali alias Baba, 28, had been evading police since 2013.In the five-hour raid, police seized Rs 35 lakh cash, gold jewellery and 9kg sandalwood. While two groups walked into the house, the third kept a watch for attack by villagers.” The duo lived in a two-storey house and police had to pass through five doors before reaching them. But it was difficult to go there as miscreants hid behind trees and pelted stones at police vehicles,” said Devaraja.“We decided to conduct a surprise raid and stormed their house around midnight.
