Katrina Kaif snapped at airport as she returns to the bay after Maldives getaway; See Pics

Katrina Kaif and celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala returned to the Bay on Sunday morning after soaking up the sun on their Maldives trip. The duo were snapped at the Mumbai airport today as they made their way out. Sporting denims, Katrina Kaif had jet-off to the tropical nation a few days ago and reportedly the getaway was a mix of work and leisure. The 'chikni chameli' star had also shared pictures from her beach getaway which included her friends make-up artist Daniel Bauer and Yasmin Karachiwala.

The actress looked a wee bit tanned as she was snapped exiting the airport. While Yasmin was in her usual workout outfits, Katrina Kaif was sporting a white tee, denim jacket and a pair of comfortable jeans. She completed her look with a pair of dark tinted sunglasses and a pair of shoes. While in the Maldives, Katrina had shared an adorable group picture and wrote “My best people... Couldn’t do much without you." She also shared a few close-up pictures of herself.
