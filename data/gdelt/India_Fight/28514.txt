Kerala Weather Report: Rains to reach Kerala in 2 days; no respite yet in North, Central India

NEW DELHI: Monsoon is likely to get a boost with a change in atmospheric conditions in the next two days to hit the Kerala coasts, the weather office said on Monday.The announcement came as a breather amid growing anxiety with the rain clouds being nearly static over the seas for many days.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said monsoon had advanced into the southern-most parts of the Arabian sea, some more parts of Maldives-Comorin area, southwest, southeast and east coast of the Bay of Bengal. IMD had earlier forecast that monsoon would hit the Kerala coast on June 6, later than the normal date of June 1.“An east-west shear zone at 3.1 km above mean sea level is very likely to develop across extreme south peninsula from June 5 onwards, leading to favourable conditions for onset of Southwest Monsoon over Kerala,” the IMD forecast said.A cyclonic circulation in lower levels lies over Lakshadweep area and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea, which is likely to move westwards without any intensification during next two days, it said.“Under its influence, cross-equatorial flow over southern parts of the South Arabian Sea is likely to increase gradually favouring advance of southwest monsoon over southern parts of the Arabian sea during next 48 hours,” the forecast said.The weather office of Sri Lanka, where monsoon reaches before hitting Kerala, said that monsoon conditions are gradually establishing over the island. “Therefore, showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance over the Island (particularly in the South-western part) from Monday night,” the Lankan Met office said.India, however, may not expect a relief from the severe heat wave, which is likely to continue over Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha through the next 2-3 days. Heat wave conditions are very likely to prevail over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and south Uttar Pradesh for the next two days.Thunderstorms and bouts of heavy rain, which are likely to lash parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the next 2-3 days ahead of the onset of monsoon, would hardly have any impact on heat waves sweeping across northern, central and western parts of the country.“The temperature will soar to 50-degree levels in parts of Rajasthan as it has in last couple of days. On the average, the mercury will be 2-3 degree above the normal levels in most parts of the country,” said a senior IMD official.Fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rain is likely in Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura in the next three days.
