A local court on Friday stayed an order of a railway court against actor-turned-politician Sunny Deol and actress Karishma Kapoor in a case of alleged 'chain-pulling' during the shooting of their film 'Bajrang' between Phulera and Narena railway stations in 1997.

While staying the case based on separate review petitions filed by Deol and Kapoor, the Additional Sessions Court observed that in 2010 the court had set aside the charges framed against the actors under Sections 141, 145, 147 of the Railway Act, but the railway trial court had still framed the charges and had summoned three witnesses for the next hearing on September 24.

The court asked for the trial court's record and scheduled the hearing of the case for October 1, the actors' lawyer A K Jain told The Tribune.

The actors are accused of violating Section 141 (needlessly interfering with the means of communication in a train), Section 145 (drunkenness or nuisance), Section 146 (obstructing a railway servant in his duties), and Section 147 (trespass and refusal to desist from trespass) of the Railways Act.

Deol and Kapoor along with stuntman Tinu Verma and Satish Shah were accused of allegedly illegally entering the Narena station at Phulera in Ajmer division for during the shooting of the film. They allegedly pulled the chain of Train 2413-A Uplink Express causing its delay by 25 minutes.

The then assistant station master of Narena station Sitaram Malakar had filed a written complaint with the General Railway Police after the incident. Malakar had said that a few persons from Mumbai, who were shooting for a film in Sanvarda village near Phulera, had pulled the emergency chain of the train.
