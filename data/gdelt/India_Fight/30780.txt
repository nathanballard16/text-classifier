Retired army man shoots at 19 year old daughter after she resists rape attempt

In a spine chilling incident a retired army man shot her teenage daughter after she resisted his attempt to rape her.

The incident happened in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior city on Monday.

The 19-year-old girl received a bullet injury to the head and is currently hospitalised and the man, a retired Naib Subedar in the Army identified as Rajesh Rajawat (46), has been arrested, City Superintendent of Police (CSP) Ravi Bhadauriya was quoted as saying by India Today.

He said Rajawat, in an inebriated condition, went to his daughter’s room and tried to assault her.

“She rushed to her mother’s room. The accused followed her and tried to force her into another room. When his wife resisted, he opened fire, leaving the teenage girl with a bullet injury in the head,” he said.

Neighbours on hearing gunshots alerted police who reached the site, nabbed Rajawat and seized the gun from which he fired two rounds, the CSP said.

He has been charged under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 307 (attempt to murder), Bhadauriya said.
