45-yr-old man found dead in Haibowal

Ludhiana: A 45-year-old man was found dead at a vacant pot in Haibowal on Friday morning.

An admit card of a private hospital, which was found in his pocket, helped establish his identity as Sham Sundar.

Assistant sub-inspector Suresh Kumar said, “During initial inquiry it was found that Sundar, 45, worked as a labourer and died of illness. We are yet to find out his place of residence and his family. The autopsy report will make the cause of death clear.”

The body will be kept at civil hospital for 72 hours.
