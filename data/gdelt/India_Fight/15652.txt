The Union Cabinet on Monday condoled the demise of Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, saying he would be remembered for his simplicity and as an exceptional administrator.

After observing a two-minute silence, the Cabinet also passed a resolution which said that in his death the country had lost an able administrator who was affectionately called the “chief minister of commoners”.

“Shri Parrikar will be remembered for his simplicity and his abilities as an exceptional administrator. His contribution to the building of modern Goa and to the modernisation of India’s Armed Forces as well as improvement to the lives of ex-servicemen will never be forgotten,” the resolution read.

Whenever a senior leader of any political party or a minister passes away, the Union Cabinet meets to condole the demise.
