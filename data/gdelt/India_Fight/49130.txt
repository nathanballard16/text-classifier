‘Choti Diwali’ being celebrated

The day before Diwali is celebrated as ‘Choti Diwali’ or ‘Small Diwali’ or ‘Naraka Chaturdashi’. The legend behind celebrating Narak Chaturdashi is quite interesting. As per the Hindu mythology, a powerful demon named Narakasura was killed by Goddess Kali on this very day. It is believed that Narakasura used to ill-treat and misbehave with women which is why the Goddess killed him. Which is why, people, especially in south India worship the Goddess on this day.

Choti Diwali comes a day before Diwali or Lakshmi Pooja and the festival is known by various names – Naraka Chaturdashi, Kali Chaudas, Roop Chaudas or Naraka Nivaran Chaturdashi.

It is believed that on this day, asura or demon Narakasura was killed by Krishna, Lord Vishnu’s avatar.

Friends and families get together, light ‘diyas’ or earthen lamps in their houses, feast on sweet delicacies, exchange gifts, play games and burn crackers.

Meanwhile in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to grace the Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya on Saturday.

Over 5.50 lakh earthen lamps will be lit a day ahead of Diwali.

In another event, a mega laser show has been organised in the National Capital to promote community-level celebrations for Diwali and to discourage the people from bursting crackers this Diwali.
