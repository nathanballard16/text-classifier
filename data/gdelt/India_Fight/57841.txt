Mantri calls on kin of injured, skips homes of slain ‘rioters’

BIJNOR: Uttar Pradesh minister Kapil Dev Agarwal, who visited Bijnor to meet the families of those injured in last Friday’s violence during anti-CAA protests, stoked a controversy after he refused to meet the families of the two Muslim men who fell to bullets.However, he visited the family of another injured victim, Om Raj Saini . The two deaths also happened in the same area. “Why would I visit families of ‘upadravi’ (rioters)? People who want to put the country on fire are anti-social. Why would I visit families of such anti-social elements? I don’t differentiate between Hindu or Muslim. I chose not to go because they are ‘upadravi’,” Agarwal said.Agarwal met the family members of Om Raj Saini, a 25-year-old resident of the adjoining Kasampur village who sustained bullet injuries on December 20. Police had claimed that Saini was a bystander and a bullet by a protester hit him.Agarwal promised all help to his family members as he skipped houses of Sulemanand Anas, who were killed in violence on Friday. Later, local SP admitted that Suleman was killed by a bullet fired by a cop in self-defence while Anas died due to injuries from a stray bullet fired by protesters. Afzal Ahmed Usmani, maternal uncle of Suleman, said, “Humanity is above all religions and castes.The government is pursuing divisive politics. A visit to our house to hear our plight would not have harmed anybody.” “Violence here was engineered. Police had opened fire at agitators resulting in the death of Suleman and Anas and injuries to Om Raj. We will prove it in court,” he said.
