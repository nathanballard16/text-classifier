Nine injured in communal clash in Ahmedabad district

Nine persons were injured, two of them seriously, when members of two communities clashed near Viramgam town in Ahmedabad district Sunday, police said.

The two groups attacked each other with sticks and pelted stones, a local police official said.

A police team too came under attack when it went to arrest the culprits, he said.

Some members of the Muslim community objected to women from another community drying clothes on an under-construction wall around a burial ground which led to the clash, Ahmedabad (Rural) Superintendent of Police R V Asari said.

Two persons sustained fractures and seven others sustained minor injuries in the incident, said inspector U B Dhakhada of Viramgam Police Station.

The police brought the situation under control by firing tear-gas shells and arrested some persons, he said.

Security has been tightened in the area, the inspector added.
