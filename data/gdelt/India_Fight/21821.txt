CM Kumaraswamy terms Sri Lanka blasts as ‘Cowardly Attacks’

Udupi: On Tuesday, April 23 Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy described the Easter Day terror attack in Sri Lanka, which killed more than 300 people, as an act of cowardice against innocent people and called for such violence to be eradicated.

After two days of Naturopathy treatment at Kaup in Udupi district, the Chief Minister discontinued the treatment and returned to Bengaluru on April 23.

Speaking to media persons at Kaup, Kumaraswamy said, “Many Indians including 5 JDS party workers were killed in the incident. The victims have been identified as Lakshmana Gowda Ramesh, KM Lakshminarayan, M Rangappa, Hanumaiah Shivakumar and KG Hanumantharayappa. All five of them were the pillars of our party. We lost our sincere activists in the incident which is a big loss to our party as well as their families.”

Kumaraswamy further said, “I am deeply shocked at the loss of our JDS party workers, whom I knew personally. Our chief secretary is in constant touch with the Sri Lankan Embassy. We have requested the Sri Lankan Government to release the bodies as early as possible to the family members. We have arranged a special Air-Cargo to bring the bodies to Karnataka.”
