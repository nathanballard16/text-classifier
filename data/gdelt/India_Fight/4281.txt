Rally offers a treat for vintage car enthusiasts

Over 50 classic cars and motorcycles took part in the Puducherry-Chennai leg of the heritage drive

An array of vintage cars lined up on the Promenade Beach provided a feast for the eyes of tourists, visitors and automobile buffs on Sunday.

The cars of a bygone era had rolled into the city on Saturday as part of the Chennai-Puducherry Heritage Car Drive 2019 organised by the Madras Heritage Motoring Club, Indian Oil Corporation and the Tourism Department.

A host of other organisations supported the event.

Over 50 vintage and classic cars, as well a few motorbikes, were flagged off from Chennai on Saturday.

The rally of vintage vehicles had a stop-over at Mammallapuram before they resumed the journey to reach the city on Saturday evening just as the crowds began to swell on the Promenade Beach.

On Sunday, the return journey of the convoy of classic cars was flagged off by Tourism Director L. Mohammed Mansoor near Gandhi Square.
