PHOTOS: Janhvi Kapoor looks like a summer breeze as she heads to Lucknow to shoot for her next film

Of late, Janhvi Kapoor has been winning the internet with her ethnic look because more often than not, this 22-year-old actress is seen sporting Indian wear- be it going to the airport or coming out of the gym. And today, Janhvi Kapoor brightened up the internet when she was papped at the Mumbai airport channeling the Indian girl in her as she was seen wearing white kurta paired with blue palazzos and printed dupatta and as always, she made for a pretty picture.

After making her Bollywood debut with Shashank Khaitan’s Dhadak opposite Ishaan Khatter, Janhvi Kapoor has started shooting for her next film which is tentatively titled Kargil Girl and the film is based on the life of an Indian Air Force pilot Gunjan Saxena, who was the first ever Indian woman to fly into a combat zone. For all those who don’t know, Gunjan Saxena had evacuated injured soldiers in the 1999 Kargil War and she was later honoured with the Shaurya Chakra.

In the film, while Janhvi will be essaying the role of Gunjan Saxena, Pankaj Tripathi will be essaying the role of Janhvi’s father and in an interview, Pankaj was all praises for Janhvi as he said that, “I am playing the role of Janhvi's father in the film and she is a brilliant actress. I learn a lot from her as she is very hardworking and serious for her work.” In the film, Angad Bedi will essay the role of Janhvi’s brother. The film is being helmed by Sharan Sharma.
