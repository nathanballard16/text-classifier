A 33-year-old Delhi Police constable allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself with a revolver at the Dhaula Kuan police post, an official said.

The deceased, identified as Parun Tyagi (40), was believed to be suffering from depression for the past few months.

According to the police, he had had a heated argument with his wife on Friday night and in a fit of rage, he went to the arms room, and took a gun and shot himself in the Central Hall there.

The entire incident has been captured on the CCTV camera. Hearing the sound of a gunshot, other police officers rushed to the Central Hall where Tyagi was found unconscious on the floor.

He was taken to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared him to be brought dead, said a senior official of Delhi Cantonment police station.

The official said that Tyagi was a native of Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh, and was living here with wife, who is also a Delhi Police constable.

Tyagi was in depression for a long time and therefore the department had not given him a service revolver for the last one and half years. He was generally posted in places where the use of a weapon was not involved. But as he was a duty officer on Friday night, he had access to the arms room where he took the weapon from, the officer added.

Tyagi’s body has been placed in the mortuary and his family members have been informed. The postmortem will be conducted in their presence, the police added. His relationship with his wife is believed to be the reason behind the suicide. He had joined Delhi Police as a constable in 2006 and got married in 2011.
