Two alleged mobile phone snatchers were arrested here after an exchange of gunfire with police on Barapulla in South Delhi, an official said on Friday.

The arrested persons have been identified as Anil alias Narender and Arun. They are involved in several criminal cases, according to the police.

The police said that they had received information that Anil, who has been declared as a proclaimed offendor in many cases, will be coming to South Delhi area with his associates.

“A trap was laid on Barapula Station road near Mathura Road at 4 a.m. We signalled two men in a motorcycle to stop, but the rider accelerated and tried to get away. Police team chased the motorcycle and blocked the way from both sides. On finding themselves covered, they opened fire on police. Police team retaliated, and the men were hit in the legs. They were taken to hospital and will be formally arrested after treatment," said a police officer.
