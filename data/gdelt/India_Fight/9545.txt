Major terrorist camps wiped out in 21-minute operation: How IAF's Mirage 2000 jets carried out air strikes across LoC

Sources said the IAF jets pounded terror camps in Balakot, Muzaffarabad and Chakoti in the well-planned strike involving a fleet of IAF jets and other military jets.

Indian Air Force on Tuesday carried out pre-dawn air strikes on terror camps across the Line of Control (LoC) in the Pakistani side, 12 days after Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group carried out the dastardly Pulwama attack in Kashmir.

Government sources said the IAF jets pounded terror camps in Balakot, Muzaffarabad and Chakoti in the well-planned strike involving a fleet of Mirage 2000s and other jets.

Hours later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of Cabinet Committee on Security which was attended by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Sitharaman.

The development comes amid heightened tension between India and Pakistan after the February 14 suicide attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group that killed 40 CRPF soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district.
