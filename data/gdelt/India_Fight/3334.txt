Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani first teamed up together for the remake of the song Urvashi. The audience was in love with their dance moves and steamy hot chemistry. At that time, Shahid was shooting for the film Kabir Singh. Earlier, the film was supposed to cast Tara Sutaria in the lead role. However, she walked out of the project and was replaced by Kiara. Now that Shahid and Kiara will be seen together in a film, the excitement is only more.
