This is not the first time when our soldiers have lost their lives due to an avalanche. Three soldiers were killed when an avalanche struck their post in Machhil sector of Jammu and Kashmir in February 2018. In 2016, a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) and nine other soldiers of Madras Regiment were buried after their post was hit by an avalanche in Siachen at an altitude of 19,600 feet close to the Line of Control (LoC).

Meanwhile, Kashmir received it first snowfall of the New Year on Wednesday, breaking a month-long dry spell in the Valley. The 300-kilometre-long Jammu-Srinagar national highway and the Mughal Road, which connects Jammu's Poonch and Rajouri districts with south Kashmir's Shopian, have been closed for vehicular traffic after the fresh snowfall, according to officials.
