Kerala: Periya double murder fuels an emotionally charged political campaign

Though the troupe did not perform after the double murder, they performed before the gathering in the absence of their leaders who are no longer with them. It was under the leadership of the two that Yuvajana Vadiyakala Sangham, a local troupe for the melam was formed. KANNUR: With the Lok Sabha election round the corner, and the Congress all set to use the murder of two youths at Kalliyot near Periya in Kasaragod as a political weapon against the CPM , a gathering of the ‘mothers and sisters’ was organised there on Tuesday, under the aegis of the Mahila Congress, which added up to the emotional intensity of the campaign.Though the programme was organized as a protest gathering in which around 2,000 women, mostly Mahila Congress activists from different parts of the state attended, ultimately it became the gathering of the grieving women, and even the top leaders of the organization were in sobs when they talked about Kripesh and Sarath Lal P K, the young activists of the Congress party, who were hacked to death on February 17.The meeting was attended by top leaders of the organization, including Mahila Congress state president Lathika Subhash, organisation’s leader in-charge of Kerala Chaman Farzana, Congress national secretary Shanimol Usman, as also Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader K K Rama among others.Shanimol Usman, in her address, fiercely attacked chief minister Pinarayi for not visiting the houses of the two slain youths and said what the chief minister needs is not the so-called ‘iratta chang’ but a conscience and good heart to rule the state.Congress president Rahul Gandhi would be coming to meet the families and share their grief, but Pinarayi Vijayan did not have the heart to visit them, she said, adding that the politics of violence and bloodshed should be defeated politically.K K Rama, in her address, said the murders are happening again and again because no leader has been convicted till now and they should be brought before the law.Equating the double murder with the lynching of people over beef in north India, Chaman Farzana said the CPM is eliminating people with different political views while the BJP supporters kill people for their food habits.Both thoughts should be defeated, she said, adding that there should not be any space for such violent thoughts and intolerance in the society.The families of Sarath Lal and Kripesh also visited the protest site and they said they were determined to get justice for the slain children.During the meeting the video of a chenda melam in which the two youths were star cast, was also showed.
