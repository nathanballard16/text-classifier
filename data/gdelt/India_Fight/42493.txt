India toys with giving domestic shipping a sulphur cap pass

The Hindu Business Line, one of India’s premier financial newspapers, is reporting New Delhi is contemplating not imposing the global sulphur cap – due to start in 117 days – for ships plying domestic waters.

A similar mooted move was floated by Indonesian authorities six weeks ago, before Jakarta stepped back into line with the global regulation.

“We will not insist on implementing the IMO norms for ships that ply in domestic waters — in inland waterways or only along the Indian coast – in order to keep a check on the total logistics cost,” a shipping ministry official told the Chennai-based newspaper.

New Delhi has been trying to foster greater use of domestic cargo shipping around its coastline and along its rivers in recent years to relieve pressure on the nation’s choked road and rail systems.

The comment has yet to be backed up however by any official announcement from India’s shipping ministry in Mumbai. If correct, it would represent a quick volte-face given that the minister of state for shipping, Mansukh Mandaviya, speaking at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry at the end of July, said India was committed to complying with the sulphur cap.
