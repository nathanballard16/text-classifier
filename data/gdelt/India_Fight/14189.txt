Three months after four miscreants opened fire on the owner of GH Ornaments, a jewellery store at the NAC, Mani Majra, one of the suspects has been arrested by the UT police. The suspect has a criminal past with several heinous cases, including murder, registered against him in Haryana and Delhi.

The suspect has been identified as Parveen Kumar, alias Molad (31), a resident of Sonepat district in Haryana.

On December 4, victim Hanumant Bhosle, was standing outside the showroom on the first floor when the miscreants carrying pistols arrived. The victim panicked and tried to run after which one of the miscreants opened fire on him. Bhosle managed to escape and locked himself inside his cabin. The suspects then escaped from the spot in a white Maruti Breeza.

The police said during investigation, it was found that Parveen, one of the suspects, was lodged at Rohini jail in Delhi in a case under the Arms Act, registered against him on February 2.

The UT police then sought his production warrant from the court. During interrogation, the suspect disclosed that he had been awarded life imprisonment in a murder case in Haryana. He said he was released on parole, after which he jumped the parole.

The police said the suspect then again got involved in crime. “The suspect, along with his associates, had arrived at the jewellery store with a motive of robbery. However, they could not succeed,” said a police official.

The UT police have sent teams to arrest the remaining three suspects in the case.
