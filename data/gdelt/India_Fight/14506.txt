Lucknow: Shock has gripped the quiet hamlet of Haidarnagar Jalalpur village in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh following the brutal murders of a newly-married couple. The 21-year-old woman was allegedly shot dead by her cousin after she got her paramour, another cousin, to murder her husband who she suspected of having an affair less than five days after the two got married.

Police stumbled across the truth of the matter when 35-year-old Sumit Kumar, a cousin of the deceased newly-married woman confessed to murdering her before the Titawai police station. Kumar told officials that he took his cousin Shivani to a field where he shot her dead with a country-made pistol for foiling the family's reputation.

According to what Sumit told investigators, Shivani suspected her 24-year-old husband Shailendra of having an affair with one of his cousins. However, she was also engaged in an extra-marital affair with her own cousin Anuj. When Shailendra came to visit Shivani along with his brother Manish on March 4, the newly-married woman roped in her paramour and hatched a plan to murder her husband.

Acting on Shivani's instructions, Anuj shot Shailendra dead and left his brother with injuries. Sumit, upon finding out about his sister's actions, got in a fit of rage and killed her for "tarnishing the family's image", said superintendent of police (SO) of Titawai police station Kshitij Kumar. Meanwhile, senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Muzaffarnagar Sudhir Kumar Singh told media personnel during a press conference that Anuj has been arrested for the murder of Shailendra.
