Delhi Police suspends 3 cops over finding their action 'not upto mark' after woman journalist attacked, robbed

The Delhi Police on Tuesday suspended three police officers as the action taken by them after a woman journalist was attacked and robbed in Delhi's Chittaranjan Park was not found to be "upto the mark".

An assistant sub-inspector and two constables were suspended, police said.

A journalist working in a new agency suffered injuries on her face and arms after she was attacked by two bike-borne robbers in broad daylight.

The assailants dragged her out of a moving auto-rickshaw, snatched her phone and managed to flee the spot.

As she was bleeding profusely, the Delhi Police took her to a nearby hospital and was later shifted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

The police had, on Monday, formed a special team to nab the bike-borne snatchers involved in attacking the woman and an FIR has also been registered in the matter.
