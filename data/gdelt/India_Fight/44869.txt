New Delhi, Sep 25 : The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday requested the Supreme Court to grant more time to record the statement of lawyer in the Unnao rape survivor accident case.

The lawyer Mahendra Singh, who suffered critical injuries in the Rae Bareli accident on July 28, is still unconscious, CBI told a bench headed by Justice Deepak Gupta.

The court granted two weeks more to the CBI to file investigation report after concluding investigation in the accident matter and adjourned the case for October for further hearing.

The court had taken suo moto cognizance of a letter written by the family of the victim alleging threats from men close to expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the main accused in the case.
