Hyderabad case: Irani questions cops for jurisdiction fight

NEW DELHI: Women and child development minister Smriti Irani on Sunday raised concern over instances of the police passing the buck on account of a particular crime spot not falling in their jurisdiction. This once again came to light in the recent Hyderabad veterinary doctor’s rape and murder, which has rocked the country.Responding to a question during a panel discussion on Swachh Bharat at the Times Litfest, Irani also said police personnel in many cases did not show empathy while dealing with sensitive and serious cases. Drinking water and sanitation secretary Parameswaran Iyer, who was also on the panel at the festival sponsored by Rajnigandha , discussed how rural women were more vulnerable when they went out since they had no access to toilets at homes.The National Commission of Women (NCW), which looked into the Hyderabad case, found that a lot of time was wasted because the police were fighting over jurisdiction and where the case should be lodged. The family told the NCW that before filing the complaint, the police even levelled claimed that “she had eloped with someone”.In her response to another question over behaviour of the police, Irani said, “How can I dignify a cop who talks badly and behaves badly regarding a woman.” She highlighted how the steps taken by the government against sex offenders which include a database of names of seven lakh convicted sexual offenders against children and setting up one-stop crisis centres across states and fast-track courts to try such offences.Irani and Iyer said the success of Swachh Bharat would be a template for several programmes which requires a high level of public participation. They gave credit to PM Narendra Modi for leading from the front in the world’s largest behavioural change programme. “Once the PM spoke about toilets from Red Fort , it was okay to approach media personalities and we created various advertisements with Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar and more,” Iyer said.Irani said building toilets was never on the political agenda of any political party but the Modi government had changed mindsets. “Just imagine that now, at least 33 crore people start their day using toilets in their homes every day and they did not have them all these years,” the minister said.
