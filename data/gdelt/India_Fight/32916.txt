Hyderabad: Uneven surface, loose sand caused tragedy

Attempts being made to straighten the crane which crashed due to the weight of the girder at the site of the flyover construction at Tolichowki on Tuesday.

Hyderabad: The cause of the crane mishap at Shaiket, which claimed the life of the operator, was stated to be the uneven road and loose earth that caused a depression and rendered the equipment to go off balance, according to the initial assessment carried out by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials at the site.

GHMC commissioner M. Dana Kishore, along with senior officials, visited the site and inspected the road condition.

The cranes have been working in the area to lift cement blocks and other heavy materials for the flyover project that began in 2018. The flyover was being constructed as part of the Strategic Road Develop-ment Plan on the Shaikpet-OU Colony stretch to facilitate smooth flow of traffic from Mehdipatnam towards Gachibowli.

Mr Kishore said, “This is the first time that such an unfortunate incident occurred in the project work being carried out by the state government. We are investigating the reason for this mishap and there will be a review of all safety measures which must be taken up in road works.”

Traffic police placed barricades to block one lane of the road and asked people to take alternative routes. The accident occurred on one of the main routes for commuters working in the IT companies at Gachibowli and this led to a huge traffic jam.

Mr V.V.S. Ramalinga Raju, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “More than 100 traffic personnel have been deployed in the area since morning. Traffic on this route has been diverted to Filmnagar, 7 Tombs. OU Colony Officials and the contractor have not been able to remove the crane for the past 14 hours. As soon as they give us clearance, we will allow the traffic.
