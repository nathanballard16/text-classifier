Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has issued a look-out notice against former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam to stop him from leaving the country.

After the issuance of the notice, Kumar, who is close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee cannot go to abroad as all airport authorities will inform the CBI if he tries to leave India.

This notice, issued on May 23, will remain effective for one year, media reports said.

Earlier on Friday, the Supreme Court dismissed Kumar’s plea, seeking extension of protection from arrest by the CBI.

Kumar had earlier filed a petition seeking extension of protection from arrest till concerned jurisdictional court in West Bengal decides his anticipatory bail plea.

The former Kolkata police chief was earlier granted protection from arrest by the apex court for seven days, which ended on Friday.

During the hearing on May 24, the apex court asked Kumar to approach the Calcutta High Court or the trial court there for appropriate relief.

"You (Rajeev Kumar) can go to Calcutta High Court or trial court as they are functional. There is no vacation there (in courts of West Bengal). Seek appropriate remedy," a vacation bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had said.

Kumar is accused of being involved in suppressing crucial evidence in the chit fund probe when he was the head of the SIT, appointed by the West Bengal government.

In 2014, the SIT transferred the probe to the CBI following Supreme Court’s order.
