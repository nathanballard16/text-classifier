Akshay Kumar’s quick rides

The traffic in Mumbai has ensured that even Bollywood actors resort to public transport for commuting. Many of them have been spotted at the Versova jetty in Mumbai, taking the ferry to reach Madh Island, where a lot of Bollywood films are shot.

Recently, Akshay Kumar was seen travelling to his Madh Island shoot of Laxmmi Bomb in a metro. The actor took the train to reach back to Versova after shooting for Good News with director Raj Mehta. “It showed over two hours on the GPS. And Raj suggested that we should try the metro. We took two security guards with us and came over. I am actually covering the distance in just 20 minutes,” Akshay was seen grinning in a video that he shot while taking the metro.

When Akshay panned his camera to the other side, actually, none of the passengers were even looking at him. Earlier, Akshay used to take his motorbike to travel to work to beat the Mumbai traffic.
