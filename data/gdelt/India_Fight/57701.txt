Santrampur on the edge over preying of bovines by leopards

Vadodara: Preying of cattle by leopards in quick succession have led to concern in parts of Santrampur taluka in Mahisagar district. After at least three bovines were killed in the Santrampur taluka this month itself, forest officials visited the villages to ascertain the cause and damage.

Similar incidents were reported in the area last month too making villagers of Kanjara, Bhandara, Khedapa and Kharwa apprehensive about their livestock.

In the incident at Kharwa, an ox was killed by a big cat which dragged it for a long distance. The ox was tethered with other animals near the farmer’s house. On hearing the commotion, villagers searched the area and found the carcass at a distance from the house.

Forest officials carried out an autopsy on the carcass to facilitate compensation for the farmer. Mahisagar deputy conservator of forests in-charge, R D Jadeja, said: “Leopards often prey on domesticated animals in the area. At times, the number of killings go up to 22 in a month. But there is no reason to panic.”

Jadeja said that the Mahisagar district is home to nearly 40 leopards. He added that the faeces, pugmarks and other evidence were checked in the villages to ascertain that the bovines were actually killed by leopards or some other big cat.

The forest department has been exercising caution in Mahisagar after a tiger was spotted there earlier this year.

The tiger was subsequently found dead and it had come to light that it had died due to starvation.

Sources said that Santrampur villagers believe that there was a pair of leopards in the area leading to the larger number of killings.

The killings, however, have not led to any adverse reaction against the big cats from the villagers. “In case of small animals like goats, villagers at times do not even approach us for compensation,” Jadeja said.
