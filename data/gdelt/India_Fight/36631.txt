BJP Legislator Charged with Attempted Murder After Rape Victim's Car Crash

The mother of the survivor accused BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar of plotting to "eliminate" her daughter, who is now on a ventilator in a hospital in Lucknow, the state's capital. One of the two deceased aunts of the girl was a witness in the rape case.

"It was not an accident, but a conspiracy to eliminate all of us... The son of a co-accused in the case, Shahi Singh, and another youth in the village had threatened us...I have got to know that the lawmaker got it done. He is doing everything from inside jail," the news agency Press Trust of India quoted the mother of the victim as saying.

On Monday police said that two people had been killed in the 28 July accident, while the victim and her lawyer were critically injured when a speeding truck crashed into their car in Rae Bareli. State police Chief O.P. Singh said he had ordered an enquiry into the accident as suspicion has grown. Surprisingly, three security personnel who were provided to the victim were not accompanying her at the time of the collision.
