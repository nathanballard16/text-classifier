Bikaner: At least 10 people were killed and 22 others left injured as a bus collided with a truck in Rajasthan's Bikaner district on Monday. Earlier, police had put the death toll at 14.

The accident occurred on National Highway 11 near Shri Dungargarh early morning when the bus was en route to Jaipur from Bikaner.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot expressed his condolences.

"Extremely pained to know of the terrible accident on NH 11, Bikaner-Jaipur highway in which eleven people have lost lives. It is heart-wrenching and my thoughts go out to all family members of the deceased. May God give them strength. Prayers for the injured," he tweeted.

As per the Rajasthan police, 5 people died on the spot while others succumbed to injuries during treatment. Those injured have been admitted to the PBM government hospital.

SHO Ghulam Nabi, Sheruna station, said that the collision between the bus and the truck was so severe that both the vehicles caught fire. As soon as they received the information from the locals regarding the accident, police and fire brigade personnel were rushed to the accident site.

The prima facie reports suggest that the accident took place because of reduced visibility due to fog. A detailed probe will be done once the injured recover, said Nabi.

He added that the deceased are yet to be identified.

Last week, seven people - four women and three men - were killed when a passenger bus and a Bolero collided head-on. Seven people were left injured in the accident at Palana village in Bikaner’s Deshnok town.
