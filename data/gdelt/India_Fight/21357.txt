Bangladesh secured 150th position in the World Press Freedom Index 2019 rankings, whereas Norway took the top position and Turkmenistan (180th) in the bottom.

Other than Bangladesh, elsewhere in South Asia the overall situation was deadly for reporters.

In Afghanistan (121st) 16 media professionals were killed, six in India (140th) and three in Pakistan (142nd) in 2018, the RSF index states.

Physical violence against journalists is encouraged by the fact that the perpetrators usually enjoy complete impunity, Reporters Without Borders said in the index report.

"This tragic toll was accompanied by an increase in violence coming from all quarters, including the security forces, organized crime and political activists," RSF said.
