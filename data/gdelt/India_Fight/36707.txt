Snake bites drunk man. Drunk man bites snack back!

AJO, AZ - MARCH 27: A rattlesnake tastes the air on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Reserve on March 27, 2006 near Ajo, Arizona. Because of escalating environmental problems associated with the region?s massive illegal immigration and stepped up border enforcement efforts, the vast and desert wilderness in and around the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Reserve and Organ Pipe National Monument has been described as the nation?s most embattled wilderness by reserve officials. Immigrants crossing the desert are discarding tons of used water bottles, excess clothing and other trash as they elude the Border Patrol. Border agents trying to stop them, and vehicles that cross the border illegally, are accelerating widespread off-road vehicle damage on the fragile Sonoran Desert plain at an unprecedented rate.

Check out the photo of a snake that a drunk man in India bit after the snake bit him first!

Raj was taken to a hospital. The doctors said that he was in a serious condition.

Raj’s father Babu said that his son was drunk when he bit the reptile, saying “my son was drunk. A snake entered our home and bit him. He later bit the snake into pieces. His condition is serious. We are unable to afford the expenses of his treatment.”
