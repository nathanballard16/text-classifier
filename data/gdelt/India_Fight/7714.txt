CPI(M) using police to suppress Cong.: DCC

The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) is misusing the police to suppress the Congress struggle against its anti-people policies, District Congress Committee president Babu George has alleged.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Mr. George alleged that the police had brutally assaulted the panchayat-municipal members of the Congress party, who were laying siege to the Collectorate here the other day, without any provocation.

Mr. George alleged that certain police officers were consciously creating provocative situations to unleash terror on the peaceful Congress protesters.

Indefinite stir

He said the DCC would launch an indefinite agitation to bring an end to the CPI(M)-sponsored ‘police-raj’ in the district. He alleged that the government was trying to usurp the powers of the panchayati-raj institutions.

The local MLA was trying to spread false propaganda over stadium development in Pathanamthitta.

Murder politics

Youth Congress State leader Aneesh Varikkannamala said the CPI(M) ‘murder politics’ could never destroy the Congress party.
