VK Singh's retort to opposition over Balakot Air strikes: Won't casualties happen if 1000 kgs bombs were dropped, buildings hit

On being asked about the casualty figure in IAF air strikes, Singh said, "The figure is of the attack on Balakot (250 casualty), attack was only at one place, nowhere else. The target was selected carefully, away from residential areas to avoid civilian casualty."

Amid opposition leaders launching an all out attack against the Modi govt, demanding casualty figures in the IAF Balakot airstrikes on JeM camps, Union Minister VK Singh has come out with a witty retort to answer the opposition. Countering charges levied by opposition leaders over the credibility of the strikes and the casualties inflicted to terrorists, the former Chief of Army Staff tweeted - Do you count things? Bombs were exploded, buildings were hit & will people not be killed after an explosion of a 1000 kg bomb? If killed, then you make an estimate of number of people killed. I don't know who wants to count it. It's unfortunate. Giving a reference to the Balakot airstrike, Singh drew a comparison of the terrorists with mosquitoes and tweeted, "raat 3:30 baje machchar bahut the, to maine HIT mara. Ab machchar kitne mare ye ginne baithu ya aaram se so jau? (There were lot of mosquitoes at 3:30 am, I used HIT. Now should I count the number of mosquitoes dead or should I sleep comfortably?) Yesterday, Singh had backed Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah for the number of casualties in the airstrike on Balakot.
