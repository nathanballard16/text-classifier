Pakistan has warned people living along the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) that India may attack to avenge last week's suicide bombing in Pulwama, in which 40 Indian paramiltary soldiers were martyred.

It has asked the area's residents to avoid groups, arrange bunkers, turn off unnecessary lights at night and report suspicious activity.

The terrorist attack in Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir was carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based group.

India has accused Pakistani intelligence of involvement, but Islamabad has denied responsibility and threatened to retaliate in the event of an Indian attack.

Pakistan's message to civil authorities in PoK was sent on Thursday, and specifically mentions Bhimber, Neelam, Rawalkot, Haweli, Kotli and Jhelum. It warns that the Indian Army can carry out an "act of violence".

In 2016, when terrorists killed Indian Army soldiers in Uri, India carried out cross-border strikes on terrorist launchpads in PoK within days.

In the past week, India has killed the mastermind of the Pulwama bombing and two other terrorists, and launched a diplomatic offensive to isolate Islamabad on the world stage.

It has revoked Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation status, increasing basic customs duty on Pakistani exports to India to 200 per cent.

India has also announced it will restrict the flow of water to Pakistan from its share of rivers under a 1960 agreement -- a move officials say is a restatement if decisions already taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
