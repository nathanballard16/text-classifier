West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday fired back at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath after his Purulia rally, saying he should focus on his state.

Mamata Banerjee said Yogi Adityanath should focus on the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh.

"Ask Yogi Adityanath to take care of Uttar Pradesh. So many people have been killed and lynched. Policemen have been murdered," Mamata Banerjee said.

Yogi Adityanath held a rally in the state at a time when the West Bengal government is embroiled in a war with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) over the latter’s attempts to interrogate Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in the Saradha chit scam case.

Adityanath attacked Mamata Banerjee, saying that "nothing can be more shameful for a democracy than a chief minister sitting on a dharna."

Adityanath accused Mamata Banerjee of anarchy, hooliganism and vandalism, and said this would not remain for long. He also alleged that the West Bengal chief minister obstructed Hindu processions but allowed others.

If the BJP came to power to Bengal, TMC "goons" would be tied by their neck and his party wouldn't allow any wrongdoing in the state, he added.

Mamata Banerjee made a similar comment earlier in the day. She said the Uttar Pradesh chief minister did not have a "place to stand in UP that’s why he's roaming around in Bengal."
