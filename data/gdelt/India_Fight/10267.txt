India Closes Northern Airspace Amid Escalation of Tensions With Pakistan

New Delhi (Sputnik): A government official told Sputnik that the Srinagar, Jammu, Amritsar and Chandigarh airports were being closed to civilian air traffic amid an escalation of cross-border attacks between the land and air forces of India and Pakistan.

"Air traffic has been suspended until further notice in light of the emergency," an Airport Authority of India official told Sputnik.

Early Wednesday morning, Pakistan Air Force fighter jets crossed the LoC (de facto border with India) and dropped bombs on Indian Territory. However, the Indian government did not provide further details of the incursion.
