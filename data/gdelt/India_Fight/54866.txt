Hats off to ‘encounter’ cops, says Jaganmohan Reddy

Jagan announced that his government would introduce a bill in the current Assembly session to enact a law that will ensure speedy trial and stringent punishment in cases of atrocities against women.

Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Monday lauded his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrashekar Rao and his police over the “encounter” killing of four suspects in the gang rape and murder of a veterinarian.

“As a father of two daughters, the incident (Hyderabad gang rape and murder) left me deeply agonised. As a father, how should I react to such incidents? What sort of punishment would give a parent relief? We should think about it,” Jagan said in an emotional speech in the Assembly.

He added: “Hats off to KCR and Telangana police officers.”

Jagan criticised those talking of the human rights of the accused. “If the hero in a movie kills someone in an encounter, we all clap and say the movie is good. If a daring person does that in real life, someone will come down from Delhi in the name of the National Human Rights Commission,” he said.

“They will say this is wrong, it should not happen like that. And they ask, ‘Why did they do this?’ We are seeing such questions being raised. Our laws are in such a terrible state.”

He highlighted that seven years after the December 2012 bus brutality in Delhi, the convicts were still to be hanged.

In some countries, he claimed, the perpetrators of such crimes would be instantly shot.

“We too should bring in strong laws to hand out acceptable punishment to those guilty of crimes against women. The punishment should be handed out within three weeks of the crime,” Jagan said.
