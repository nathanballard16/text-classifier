Ex gratia to kin of man who killed himself outside AP Bhawan, Naidu links it to SCS protest

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu Monday announced Rs 20 lakh ex gratia for the family of a differently-abled man who allegedly committed suicide outside Andhra Pradesh.

He also announced a state funeral for the 40-year-old Davala Arjun Rao, a resident of Kinthali village in Srikakulam district, on Tuesday.

While Naidu linked the suicide with the demand for a special status category for Andhra Pradesh, the Delhi Police said he consumed poison as he was facing financial crisis.

Naidu is on a dharna to demand special status for his state and fulfilment of commitments made by the Centre under the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.

Police said Rao killed himself on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.
