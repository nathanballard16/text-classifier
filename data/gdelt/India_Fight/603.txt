YSRCP Flays Chandrababu For Trying To Protect Attacker In YS Jagan Murder Attempt Case

Hyderabad: Senior YSR Congress party leader Ummareddy Venkateswarlu welcomed the National Investigative Agency’s (NIA) probe into the case involving the murder attempt on the life of the Leader of Opposition in Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly YS Jagan Mohan Reddy at Vizag airport on October 25. He observed that Andhra Pradesh chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu was trying to undermine the murderous attack and misdirect the line of inquiry through his devious tactics.

Addressing the media at the party headquarters here on Friday, the senior YSR Congress party leader said that the NIA probe would come as a slap in the face of the TDP government. The real plotters behind the conspiracy should be unmasked, Ummareddy Venkateswarlu asserted. He pointed out that the people of the state viewed the attack on the Leader of the Opposition as a murderous assault on democracy.

Ummareddy Venkateswarlu recalled that the state DGP R.P. Thakur tried to give a misleading track to the murder attempt on YS Jagan within an hour of the attack. He flayed the police chief for speaking irresponsibly without proper understanding and without apprising himself of the facts. The senior YSRCP leader faulted the chief minister and the state DGP for lacking the minimum courtesy to call upon the Leader of the Opposition. This was most shameful, he said and cited the parallel of Dr. YS Rajasekhara Reddy.

Dr. YSR launched a protest fast as Leader of Opposition in the undivided state, near the Gandhi statue in Tirupati, when Maoists attacked Chandrababu Naidu who was the chief minister of the state at that time. Ummareddy Venkateswarlu expressed his anguish at the attempts of Chandrababu Naidu to protect the attacker Srinivasa Rao. He displayed his indignation at the TDP government registering a case against Srinivasa Rao under Section 307.
