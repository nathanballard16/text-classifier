JeM chief Masood Azhar on constant move since Balakot air strikes

Masood Azhar designated as global terrorist by UNSC

SRINAGAR: Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar who had been shifted by the Pakistani Army from Rawalpindi base hospital to Goth Ganni, Bhawalpur, after the Indian air strikes against his terror camp in Balakot , is now lodged in an Islamic seminary in Sheikhupura, Gujrawala, around 300 kms from Islamabad.Highly placed intelligence sources told TOI that Azhar, who was designated by the UNSC on Wednesday as global terrorist, has been on the move from one hideout to another since the Balakot air strikes. Following the terror attack in Pulwama on a CRPF convoy that killed 44 jawans, Azhar was provided 10 Pakistan Special Service Group commandos as additional security cover.Interestingly, Azhar last week visited and stayed in Athmuqam, a major camping town for terror groups, in Neelam valley near the Line of Control, sources said. Just four days ago, sources said, he stayed with Pakistani Army in Jura town of Pakistan occupied Kashmir, over 100kms northeast of Islamabad.Sources said the Indian security establishment perceived Azhar’s visit to Athmuqam as an “important development”. “Given the fact that Azhar has been suffering from a serious ailment and requires constant medical care and attention, his visit and meeting with the Army is significant. Instead of sending his younger brother Rauf Azghar, who is now the operational incharge of the terror group, he went himself. It is an indicator that Azhar had been anticipating the move by China at the UNSC,” a source said.Azhar may have gone to discuss the future of his outfit and persuade the Pakistani Army to allow his cadres, who have now joined and merged with another terror outfit Al Badr, to infiltrate into Kashmir, sources said.“The window for infiltration begins in April when the snow begins to melt on the mountains along the LoC. Jaish, which is now essentially Al Badr, is desperate to send its men into Kashmir but given the international pressure since the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent Balakot strikes, its not easy for Pakistani Army to provide cover to the infiltrators. Azhar went to meet the Army on behalf of his cadres who are ready to enter Kashmir under their new name Al Badr,” a senior officer, who tracks the movement of terror groups across LoC, said.Since the Pulwama terror attack, Indian security forces in Kashmir killed around 25 Jaish terrorists including its top leadership.
