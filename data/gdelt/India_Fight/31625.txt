The normal date of monsoon onset's progress over Delhi is yet to come, the IMD official said.

Monsoon is likely to arrive in Delhi around June 29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday dismissing reports of a delayed arrival in the national capital.

Weather conditions will improve as monsoon further advanced into some parts of the central Arabian Sea and India's western coastline, Konkan, senior IMD official Dr K. Sathi Devi told news agency ANI.

"The normal date of monsoon onset's progress over Delhi is yet to come. It is likely around June 29. There is a cyclonic circulation lying very close to Delhi so there is a good chance of rainfall and thunderstorm development," Ms Sathi added.

As per a statement issued by the IMD, southwest monsoon has further advanced into eastern more parts of central Arabian Sea, Konkan, most parts of Madhya Maharashtra, remaining parts of Marathwada, Vidarbha some parts of Madhya Pradesh.
