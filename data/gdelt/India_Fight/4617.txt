Clash at Cusat, over 50 in custody

Classes at School of Engineering suspended indefinitely

Over 50 students of the School of Engineering (SoE) at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) were taken into custody following a clash between members of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and Kerala Students Union (KSU) on the main campus here on Tuesday.

The university authorities said classes at SoE had been suspended indefinitely. Students in B. Tech hostels on the campus were told to vacate the premises immediately. Tension began after students belonging to the SFI allegedly entered the Sahara hostel and attacked those affiliated to the KSU and another group known as ‘Malabaris’.

The police said the incident was a follow-up of the clashes that broke out between the warring factions during a programme organised by fifth semester students last week. The police had to enter the hostel premises to disperse the students who threw bottles at each other.

The main campus had witnessed a similar clash in the second week of January between the rival groups. The police had then registered a case of attempt to murder against 18 students involved in the incident.
