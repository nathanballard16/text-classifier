Bihar Mahagathbandhan 'rift' comes to end; Congress, RJD likely to announce candidates' list today

As per Congress, the Darbhanga Lok Sabha seat is crucial and final decision will be taken after proper discussions between the two parties. Last week the two parties had announced seat sharing agreement in Bihar for the upcoming General Elections. Both Congress and RJD are in alliance in the state under the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ umbrella along with some other parties.

After a minor hiatus over the seat-sharing agreement for the forthcoming Lok Sabha Polls, the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) in Bihar seems to have come back on track. As per ABP News sources, both Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress along with other opposition parties could announce the name of candidates at around 10 am today. A report on Thursday stated that the political alliance between RJD and the Congress witnessed fresh tensions over the seat-sharing agreement. It was said that RJD wanted to field its candidates on Dharbhanga and Supaul seats, but Congress was adamant over leaving the two crucial seats in Bihar which has 40 Lok Sabha constituencies. "Darbhanga is our traditional seat. We have won it many times. Even in the 2014 polls, which were swept by the BJP-led NDA, our candidate lost the battle by a thin margin. We would, therefore, like to contest the seat again and field Abdul Bari Siddiqui this time. A formal announcement would be made shortly," RJD MLA and chief state spokesman Bhai Virendra told news agency PTI. Reportedly, Congress President Rahul Gandhi called for a meeting with other Opposition parties at his residence in the national capital on Wednesday. Today’s announcement can be crucial for the fate of Bihar as the state will witness a high decibel electoral battle between the Opposition grand alliance and the ruling Janata Dal-United (JDU) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition in the state.
