Indian Businessman installs 62 hand pumps in Pakistan’s Sindh province

Not worried about the tensions of India and Pakistan, an Indian businessman who lives in Dubai has installed 62 hand pumps in the Sindh province of Pakistan.

Joginder Singh Salaria, the Dubai-based businessman, set up 62 water pumps in the district of Tharparkar with the help of social workers.

The businessman also sent sacks of grains to the community.

Joginder Singh Salaria owns a transport business in Dubai and he has been living there since 1993, he said that he reached out to the social workers in the province through YouTube and Facebook.

During an interview with the Khaleej Times, Joginder Singh Salaria said, “While India-Pakistan tensions were high following the Pulwama incident, we were installing hand pumps in these poor villages.”

Joginder Singh Salaria also launched the Pehal Charitable Trust.

On February 14, a suicide bomber from Jaish-e-Mohammad, a terrorist group that is based in Pakistan, set off a bomb next to a convoy, the bomb blast killed 40 CRPF Personnel and injured 5. The incident happened in Pulwama District.

As a response to the attack, India launched air strikes across the Line of Control and destroyed a terrorist camp in Balakot, which is located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

Joginder Singh Salaria said that it took him months to search people in Tharparkar, and said that he used social media platforms to search those people.

Bheal Khangar, a social worker in the province, got attached with Joginder Singh for the project.

He said, “There are very few roads in the villages. The nearest hospital is 50km away, and people need to walk 25km to reach the main road. Schools are also very bad in those areas. Most children can’t go to school due to lack of opportunities, lack of easy access to school and lack of schools.”
