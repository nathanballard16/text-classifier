Plan to have specific names on Arunachal ST list cleared

Cabinet approves MHA’s proposal to do away with generic term ‘any Naga tribes’

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Home Ministry’s proposal to replace the generic term ‘any Naga tribes’ with the specific names of the tribes that would qualify for recognition as Scheduled Tribes in Arunachal Pradesh.

The decision taken ahead of the 2019 general election, on a proposal from the Arunachal Pradesh government, is likely to have a bearing on the peace talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak Muivah (NSCN-IM).

The NSCN-IM and other Naga groups have been campaigning for a Greater Nagalim or a contiguous land for the Nagas across Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Myanmar.

Proposal cleared in 2018

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In October last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had cleared the proposal, which was examined and recommended by the Tribal Affairs Ministry and the Registrar-General of India.

“As for replacing ‘any Naga tribes’ with the specific names of Tutsa, Wancho, Nocte and Tangsa, it has been cleared by the Tribal Affairs Ministry first. The Cabinet has endorsed it,” said a senior official.

Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2018, for revision of the list of Scheduled Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, was cleared, and the names of some communities would be deleted.

An official statement said ‘Khampti’ would be replaced with ‘Tai Khamti’ in the list. ‘Abor’ would be deleted and ‘Mishmi-Kaman, Idu and Taraon’ would be included. ‘Monpa, Memba, Sartang, Sajolong’ would be included in lieu of ‘Momba’ in the ST list of Arunachal Pradesh.

The Home Ministry will have to move the Bill in Parliament before the winter session concludes on January 8 for the changes to come into effect.
