At least two dozen people were injured as the protest called by the Bhim Army turned violent at Tughlaqabad area in Delhi. According to reports, 15 people were admitted to AIIMS, who received serious injuries. The Bhim Army claimed that clashes broke out when police detained its chief Chandrashekhar Azad while he was leading a peaceful march. "After holding a peaceful rally at Ramlila Maidan, we gave a call for a march to the site of the Ravidas temple demolished by the DDA in Tughlaqabad. But, the situation turned violent when police detained Chandrashekhar Azad. Police resorted to lathicharge and fired tear gas shells," Dr Kush, a senior member of Bhim Army's Delhi unit told TOI. He said along with Chandrashekhar, 96 other people were detained by the police at Kalkaji police station. An FIR has been filed against Chandrashekhar for "rioting and unlawful activity". The police claimed that the mob set two motorcycles on fire and vandalised a police vehicle. "An FIR has been registered on charges of rioting, unlawful assembly, voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty among others. Chandrashekhar has been arrested. 96 other protesters are also in police custody. Probe is on," the police official said. Now the issue has taken a political hue as several parties demanded the Ravidas temple should be reconstructed on the same spot in Tughlaqabad forest area or at an alternative location. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi lambasted government for lathicharge against the Dalit protesters. "This insult of Dalit voices cannot be tolerated. This is an emotional issue, and their voices must be respected," she tweeted. (BCCL)
