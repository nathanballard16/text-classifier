New Delhi: Two unidentified criminals on Tuesday sprayed multiple shots at a luxury Jaguar car belonging to a 52-year-old businessman, Inderjeet Bhatia. As per a report in the Hindustan Times, the incident was captured in CCTV cameras which took place around 2 PM when the car was parked in a lane outside his house in Pitampura.

Reportedly, the attackers were wearing masks and apparently tried to intimidate the businessman. Bhatia in his complaint stated that the accused arrived in a white car and fired several rounds at his Jaguar sedan, which costs close to half a crore rupees.

Bhatia told HT that he had no enmity with anyone and he didn't know why he was attacked. Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest) Vijyanta Arya, confirming the incident, said that the case was registered under sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of Indian Penal Code.

Further investigation is going on and police officials suspect that the incident could be a result of business rivalry or a threat to extort money from Bhatia.

Recently, Ashish Singh Chadha, scion of Wave Group of Companies and nephew of late liquor baron Ponty Chadha, was arrested after his speeding Bentley SUV allegedly rammed into an auto rickshaw, leaving one dead and three others badly injured.
