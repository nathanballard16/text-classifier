Mamata Banerjee presiding over undemocratic govt: Piyush Goyal

After the Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) mega show of opposition unity in Kolkata over the weekend, the ruling BJP on Monday fielded Union Minister Piyush Goyal who accused West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of presiding over an “undemocratic government” and asserted that “law and order has completely collapsed” in the State.

Goyal cliamed that the State government is trying to obstruct BJP President Amit Shah’s rally in Malda on Tuesday and said: “West Bengal will witness a repetition of what happened in Tripura, where the BJP increased its strength and booted the Left out. Mamata Banerjee is scared of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s increasing clout. The State government is forever creating hurdles for public events organised by the BJP. They are now blocking BJP President Amit Shah from addressing tomorrow’s rally in Malda.”

According to the Minister, the State government has “fabricated” a story about the helipad. “They have stopped the BJP President from landing there ostensibly because of some repair work. The Chief Minister had gone there some time back. They stopped the BJP’s Yuva Morcha from holding a bike rally. Let me assure Mamata Didi, that in Malda, Amit Shah will address a rally and people will congregate there to strengthen democratic forces in West Bengal,” said Goyal.

Killing of BJP workers

“Thirty-six BJP workers were killed during the Panchayat elections in West Bengal. About 1,300 political workers were injured. The law and order is out of control in the State. They are trying to give sermons to the BJP on democratic governance, but I want to ask their friendly parties: Don’t you see the collapse of democratic governance in the State? What does the Congress have to say about it?” he asked.
