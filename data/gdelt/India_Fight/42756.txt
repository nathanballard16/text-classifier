The Serpent: Jenna Coleman joins the cast of new true crime drama

If you’re a fan of Jenna Coleman’s incredible performances in dramas such as The Cry and Victoria, you’re in luck: she’s just joined the cast of a brand new crime drama.

Her new role will see her take on the character of Marie-Andrée Leclerc in The Serpent, which is based on the true story of serial killer Charles Sobrhaj.

“The Serpent intoxicated me into the dark seductive world of Charles Sobhraj,” Coleman said. “I’m so looking forward to delving into hippie trail depths and bringing to life this unfathomable real life story.”
