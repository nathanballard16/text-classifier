NEW DELHI: A tricolour flutters at the entrance of a makeshift colony of Pakistaniin Adarsh Nagar, north Delhi. The flag, residents say is an assertion of their newly acquired “Indian” identity, after religious persecution forced them to flee their own country.The 3.2-acre area isto 110 Pakistani Hindu families, comprising 720 people, including 180 kids and 240 women. The colony opposite a landfill site was set up in May 2013 when 20-odd Hindu families came to India for pilgrimage, found "freedom” and settled.But “freedom” hasn’t brought an end to their woes. Their mud houses do not provide adequate shelter against the elements. There is neither electricity nor proper sanitation facilities. Most of the migrants are agricultural labourers and do not have any other skills; so there are no jobs for them.
