Three terrorists killed during gunbattle in Jammu and Kashmir's Ganderbal; huge cache of arms seized

New Delhi: Security forces on Saturday killed three terrorists in an exchange of fire that took place in the Naranag village of Ganderbal district in Jammu and Kashmir.

In the initial investigation, the security forces found out that all the three terrorists were not locals and belonged to a foreign land.

"We believe that terrorism is not a challenge for anyone country, but for all countries and of mankind as a whole. So for the sake of humanity, all the world has to unite against terror," the Prime Minister said during his address to the 74th UN General Assembly on Friday.
