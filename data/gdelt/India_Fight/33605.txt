Manjula Shette: bail pleas of six jail officials rejected

The Bombay High Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas filed by six officials of Byculla prison for allegedly killing Manjula Shette inside her barrack in 2017.

Justice Revati Mohite Dere was hearing the bail applications filed by jailer Manisha Pokharkar, constables Surekha Kakad, Wasima Sheikh, Arti Shingne, Shital Shegaokar, and Bindu Naykode. The reasons for rejecting their bail will be recorded in a separate order in a few days.

They have been charged under Sections 120 b (punishment for criminal conspiracy), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. The city civil and sessions court has previously rejected their bail pleas.

On June 23, 2017, Manjula is alleged to have been assaulted in her barrack at Byculla jail, after which she was allegedly stripped and a baton was shoved into her private parts. Post-mortem reports have confirmed multiple injuries on her body, and a detailed autopsy report is awaited. Her death sparked a riot in the prison, and the 200-odd inmates, which include Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani Mukerjea, had destroyed prison property in the rampage that lasted till next afternoon.
