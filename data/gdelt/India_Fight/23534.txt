Narendra Modi isolated Pakistan on world stage, says Amit Shah

BIORA (MP): Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the UN Security Council designating JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, BJP chief Amit Shah Thursday said Modi has "isolated" Pakistan in the world.Addressing a campaign rally here in Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituency in Madhya Pradesh, Shah also took a jibe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi , saying he disappears to locations unknown even to his mother when "temperature soars"."Masood Azhar carried out several bomb blasts for several years. Nobody could get him declared an international terrorist. But yesterday was a golden day as he was declared a global terrorist," he said."Narendra Modi has isolated Pakistan in the world with his diplomacy. The entire world now stands with India and is supporting our country on the issue of (actions taken in) self-defense," Shah said."The entire world believes that terrorism grows on Pakistan's land. Prime Minister Narendra Modi proved this to the world," he said.Shah slammed National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah for seeking a separate prime minister for Jammu and Kashmir, and said the Congress contested elections in Kashmir in an alliance with the NC."NC leader Omar Abdullah wants a separate PM in Kashmir. They want Kashmir to secede from Hindustan," he said."Rahul Baba" (Rahul Gandhi) should bear in mind that Modi was going to be prime minister again and "even if a day comes when the BJP is not in power, the party workers would not allow it (separate PM for Kashmir) to happen", he said.On the Congress' manifesto promise to scrap the sedition law, Shah alleged that it was siding with those who shouted anti-national slogans."Anti-national slogans - Bharat Tere Tukde Honge -- were shouted at JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University). Shouldn't they be sent behind the bars," he said."During the UPA rule, there would be no response to terror attacks. After the Pulwama terror attack, there was anger and despair....But prime minister Narendra Modi ordered the IAF (to respond), which went deep inside Pakistan and destroyed terror camps," the BJP chief said."When the country was rejoicing (over the air strikes), there was mourning in two places - in Pakistan and in Rahul Gandhi-led Congress. Should we not bomb the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack," he asked.Shah also praised the Narendra Modi government for taking action against separatists in Kashmir.Listing achievements of the NDA government such as the Ayushman Bharat scheme, Ujjwala and housing for poor, Shah said, "I have seen Modi not taking a single day's leave in the past 20 years...He works 18 out of 24 hours for 365 days....On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi takes a long leave as temperature soars, even his mother keeps searching for him."Taking potshots at the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, Shah alleged that within three months of it coming to power, transactions worth Rs 281 crore were unearthed during income tax raids at the premises of those close to chief minister Kamal Nath."If this is the beginning, what will happen in 60 months," he quipped.Targeting veteran Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who is contesting the Lok Sabha election from Bhopal, Shah reminded the gathering of `poor infrastructure' such as roads, power and irrigation when Singh was chief minister.
