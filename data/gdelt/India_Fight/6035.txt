Madhya Pradesh tiger may have come with tigress, cubs, officials not sure

The tiger spotted in Mahisagar district on Saturday may have come with a female companion. The state government is searching for the female tiger likely to have come with this tiger, however, no traces of presence of a tigress has been found yet.

Unconfirmed updates came to the forest department that a female tiger along with two cubs was also spotted by local people in forests near Santrampur. The forest department, therefore, has also started looking at the possibility.

A senior official from the forest department said on condition of anonymity, "Tigers' mating season starts in November and they consummate during winters at the most. As the studies and observation show that this tiger was in Gujarat for three or more months, he might have come with a female companion otherwise he would have returned within a few days for mating."

"There are also chances that the tiger may return to his territory in search of a female companion during mating season. The issue was discussed in a meeting with the minister Ganpat Vasava. We are waiting and observing the tiger's behaviour."

Chief conservator of forests, Vadodara circle, Sanjay Srivastava, said, "There are speculations that the female tiger was also present in forests in Gujarat. We have not found any trace of presence of a female tiger, although we do not confirm nor deny these reports."

A department source said, "The government is also looking for breeding of animals such as chital and others, so that tigers get prey to hunt and does not attack cattle or humans. If this tiger gets adequate prey here, chances of encounters between the tiger and human can be lowered. This would also increase the chances of other tigers moving into Gujarat."
