He’s a gentleman as his surname suggests,” said Dr Mallikarjun.Mallikarjun Bande, subinspector of Station Bazar station, Kalaburagi, said Vishwanath is a kind person and has special affection for the people of Karnataka . Bande recalled that when he suffered a bullet injury during a shootout and was shifted to a hospital in Hyderabad. Sajjanar visited him in hospital and extended support.A PSI, who earlier worked with Kalaburagi police, said Sajjanar had solved many murder cases. He recalled that miscreants from Andhra Pradesh would dump bodies of persons murdered elsewhere in Karnataka.“I don’t remember Sajjanar’s designation then. During a meeting, I brought this issue to his notice. He immediately took action and after that, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh police jointly worked on these cases and solved many,” he said.A relative, also an officer with Karnataka police, said Vishwanath used to often visit Hubballi. One of his recent trips was to see a relative hospitalised there.
