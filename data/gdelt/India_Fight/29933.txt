#MeToo: No proof to prosecute Patekar, police tell court; Tanushree Dutta cries foul

Tanushree Dutta’s complaint against Nana Patekar in October 2018 sparked a nationwide ‘#MeToo’ movement on social media

The Mumbai police on Thursday filed a closure report in connection with the FIR registered by actor Tanushree Dutta against actor Nana Patekar, and three others, last year.

Ms. Dutta had in October last year filed a complaint against Mr. Patekar, choreographer Ganesh Acharya, producer Samee Siddiqui, and director Rakesh Sarang in connection with an incident that had allegedly occurred in 2008 on the sets of movie Horn Ok Pleasss.

On Thursday, the police filed a ‘summary report’ — seeking closure of the case — in the Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court in Andheri.

“We have not found any conclusive evidence against any of the accused named in the FIR. We had summoned several witnesses for inquiries in connection with the incident, and while some of them said they were unable to recollect the details of the incident due to the time lapse, others never turned up. We have stated all these facts in our summary report,” an officer with Oshiwara police station said.

“The police acted negligently to protect Mr. Patekar. Statements from many witnesses have not been recorded and some have been recorded partly. We will be opposing the summary report and will also be filing a writ petition before the Bombay High Court,” said Ms. Dutta’s lawyer, Advocate Nitin Satpute.
