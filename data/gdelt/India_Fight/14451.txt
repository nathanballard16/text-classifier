Wife of deceased rifleman inducted into Army

Chennai: Lieutenant Sangeeta Mall, wife of slain rifleman Shishir Mall, was commissioned into the Indian Army after passing out from the Officers Training Academy in Chennai on March 11.

Sangeeta, employed as a teacher, married Shishir in 2013.

Two years later, Shishir, who was serving at the Baramulla sector of Jammu and Kashmir, lost his life while battling terrorists in September.

Sangeeta quit her teaching job right after her husband’s demise. After attending an investiture ceremony in 2016 where her husband was awarded a Sena Medal, she was motivated to join the Indian Army.
