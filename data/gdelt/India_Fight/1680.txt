Will Hardik Patel contest Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi?

AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel is actively considering to contest Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh as an Independent candidate in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The Patel leader, who turned 25 years last July, has now become eligible to fight general elections.His close aides say several political leaders are in touch with Patel, who has travelled to Uttar Pradesh a few times in recent past to explore ground.Even if he decides to contest from Varanasi, it is unclear whether Patel will fight as an independent or represent the united opposition."He wants to contest as an independent. But he will make an announcement only after he is certain of support from all the opposition parties," says a close aide. There is a possibility that Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Aam Aadmi Party may not field their candidates if Patel fights against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi.Modi had defeated Arvind Kejriwal by an impressive 3.71 lakh votes in 2014.Taking on the PM would be a symbolic battle for the youth leader. Patel, who was travelling in Varanasi on Friday, told TOI that he hasn't finalized any plans. However, he did not rule out the possibility."I have not decided about contesting elections. I am only focusing on fight for the rights of my community. If the community asks me to contest, I will consider it," said Patel.Patel had launched an agitation in 2015 for reservation in jobs for the Patidar community. He had addressed a massive rally at the GMDC ground in Ahmedabad leading to violence that killed 11 persons.He also faced a sedition case along with five others and spent nine months in Surat jail. After his release from jail, he constantly remained vocal against the ruling BJP in his rallies.
