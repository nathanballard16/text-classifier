Samajwadi Party Takes Out Rally in Patna

Patna: Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP) in Patna on Thursday took out a rally dubbed as 'Akrosh March' to shed light on the alleged failure of the Nitish government in Bihar.

The march was led by SP Bihar in-charge Devendra Prasad Yadav who, defying restrictions imposed by the district administration, led his angry rally from the Income Tax Roundabout on Bailey Road to the Dak Bungalow Crossing where protestors clashed with the police when they tried to stop them at the makeshift barriers placed by them.

Yadav accused the state and central government of cheating the farmers when it raised the revenue tax on cultivable land to Rs. 1000. He further said that the Modi government had failed to keep its promise of doubling the income of the farmers during his first term.

"A kattah of land that used to take Rs. 70 to cultivate only four years ago now costs Rs. 140 in 2018. This is the gift from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the farmers of India who are now in worst shape than ever before," he said.

The SP leader also took the Nitish administration to task over the Muzaffarpur girls' shelter sexual abuse case.

"The government knew about the abuse going on in the shelter home and yet the Chief Minister did not do anything to stop this from taking place. Even after the story broke in the media, Nitish Kumar showed no urgency in taking action against the culprits and continued to protect Social Welfare Minister Manju Verma. Only after the opposition put pressure on the state government, the Chief Minister ordered a CBI probe into the case. However, we are not going to forget about this heinous crime committed under the watch of the NDA government just because Manju Verma has resigned. We want the entire government to resign on moral ground," Yadav said.
