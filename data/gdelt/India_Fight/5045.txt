Hours after the Kolkata Police raided two locations allegedly linked to M Nageswara Rao on Friday, the former interim CBI chief told news agency ANI, "All that is happening appears to be propaganda."

The raids were conducted a day after the Ministry of Home Affairs asked the West Bengal government to take action against five IPS officers in the state who participated in state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s dharna in Kolkata on the night of 3 February.

It was Rao under whose instruction officers of the central investigating agency landed at the doorstep of the Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar on Sunday evening to interrogate him. The CBI sleuths were later detained by the city police. The incident later stirred a controversy in the capital city of West Bengal, where its Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee went on a three-day strike against Centre, accusing the latter of political vendetta.
