JALANDHAR: Police here have arrested a resident of Apra village, Sarabjit Singh alias Badhanga, in connection with the murder of BSP worker Ram Saroop on September 25 last year.

Badhanga was wanted in the murder case. Six of his accomplices are already under arrest for the killing. Badhanga is facing 15 cases and has been declared a proclaimed offender in three of them.

SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said Sarabjit and his accomplices murdered Saroop with sharp-edged weapons. The case had led to protests by the BSP, after which an SIT led by SP (investigation) Balkar Singh was formed. However, the accused continued to dodge the police.

On Monday, a CIA team arrested Badhanga from Adda Lasara. SSP Mahal said the accused had an enmity with Saroop. “Earlier also, he had served a jail term for attacking and injuring the deceased BSP worker,” he said.

The clash had taken place between the two three years ago.
