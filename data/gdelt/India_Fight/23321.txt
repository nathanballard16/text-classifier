6 Actors Who Never Went To College But Proved Success Isn't Restricted To A Degree

No matter what part of the world we are in, education is always given a ton of importance. In a way, it is projected as the only key to attaining wisdom, that would ultimately allow us to lead a life we are not only proud of, but one that also takes care of all our material needs throughout our lives.

Yet, what most people, especially in our society choose to overlook, is the fact that an education isn't the only “key” to getting there. A sharp mind, crafty skills and an inherent talent can also bring all that, and much more, to a person's life.

Recently, during an appearance on 'The Kapil Sharma Show', 'Student of The Year 2' actor Tiger Shroff was asked by host Kapil Sharma what was the difference between a real and reel college, to which Tiger said that he was not aware of the difference since he never attended college, to begin with. He added that immediately after school he joined the sets of his first film 'Heropanti'.

Yet, if we look at Tiger's career graph, we can easily say that not going to college, and not completing his studies hasn't made him any less successful in the line of work, he chose for himself. Why? Because he had other skills, and a passion for his craft to make up for the lack of higher education on his resume.

Just like Tiger Shroff, these following 5 actors also never attended college. Read about them here:

1. Aamir Khan

Aamir Khan was only 16-years-old when he acted in a silent film titled 'Paranoia'. His performance fetched him so much appreciation that he decided to ditch the idea of studying further and got into theatre instead. There was no looking back post that, and soon he became a full-time actor.

2. Alia Bhatt

Alia had just graduated from Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai, when she had to start shooting for her debut film with Karan Johar in 2012. Alia has often expressed that she was never into academics and enjoyed extra-curricular more than studying. We suppose acting was her best bet after all. Look at all the performances she 'dhoptoed' the audience with recently!

3. Salman Khan

Bollywood's big brother went to school at St Stanislaus High School in Bandra, Mumbai. It is reported that he got himself enrolled in St Xavier's College but never attended because he wished to kick start his film career. Clearly, that was the best decision he made. Right?

4. Deepika Padukone

Deepika went to Sophia High School in Bangalore but could not complete her education because of the constant demands of her modelling career. She did get herself enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from IGNOU, but quit eventually to focus on her modelling career full-time.

5. Arjun Kapoor

Arjun Kapoor's tryst with education hasn't been a very memorable one. Arjun attended Arya Vidya Mandir school in Mumbai, where he studied till 12th grade. However, he failed to clear his class 12th exams, and he quit his studies altogether.

These Bollywood A-listers with just their school education to back them, besides truck-loads of talent, prove that success does not restrict itself to people with good degrees on their resumes. It'll come to those who follow their passion, work hard to live their dreams and know how to utilise their skills and talents to make a name for themselves and live life king size.
