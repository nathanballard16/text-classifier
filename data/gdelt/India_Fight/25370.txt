Pakistan Social Media shares wrong info

Recently the spokesperson of the Pakistani Armed Forces claimed on his Twitter account that Pakistan had shot down two Indian air force planes inside Pakistani airspace and had arrested one Indian air force pilot. Meanwhile at the time of writing, no confirmation of this claim has come from the Indian air force or the Indian Government. Furthermore a video now made viral by multiple Pakistani social media accounts is being shared with the claims that it depicts the arrested Indian air force pilot.









Reportedly a page called Pak Army has circulated this video and it has been shared over 18,000 times. Further Alt News looked up this video and found that it is being circulated in the Pakistani social media ecosystem with a false context. Apparently the video dates back to Feb 19, 2019, a day prior to Aero Show in Bangalore, when two Surya Kiran aircrafts crashed during rehearsal.





Moreover after the crash, a heartwarming video emerged on social media which showed a civilian comforting the injured pilot Vijay Shelke who had parachuted out of his jet. Hence the video that is being circulated is that of the injured pilot Vijay Shelke, and the civilian trying to comfort him. Yesterday, Alt News covered a series of misinformation that was shared on Indian mainstream media and social media post the IAF strikes in the Balakot region of Pakistan.
