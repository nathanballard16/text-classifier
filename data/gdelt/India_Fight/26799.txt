Clashes in Kolkata as India heads for final phase of polls

KOLKATA • Clashes between followers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and an opposition leader heightened tensions in the key Indian city of Kolkata yesterday ahead of the final round of the country's hard-fought national election.

Fifty-nine people were arrested in street battles late on Tuesday that forced Mr Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to leave an election rally in the eastern metropolis under armed guard, police in West Bengal state said.

A statue of renowned Bengal reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was destroyed and a college named after him ransacked in the troubles, which the BJP and rival Trinamool Congress (TMC) blamed on each other.

The state has been hit by repeated violence between the two parties during the six-week-long election that ends on Sunday.

Results will be announced on May 23.

Mr Modi's BJP hopes to capture many of the state's 42 Parliament seats from the TMC to compensate for losses predicted in other regions.

The BJP accused West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of orchestrating attacks on Mr Shah's roadshow.

"Has Bengal acquired a government of gangsters? The attack on Amit Shah's peaceful rally by TMC is deplorable," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Twitter.
