Gangster killed in shoot-out in Delhi

"Four-five miscreants came in a vehicle and started firing at Mann's car, who was on his way to meet a relative, near the Narela Industrial Area. It seems he was killed due to some old enmity," said Deputy Police Commissioner Gaurav Sharma.

According to the police, 14 criminal cases were registered against Mann, who had recently contested municipal elections.
