Don't show sympathy to Pakistan: WB BJP chief



West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh said the public should think before speaking against the government or the armed forces as there is a sentiment against Pakistan brewing across the country.



Ghosh was reacting to a question on how some were heckled or trolled for adopting an anti-war posture. "I would advise everyone to understand the sentiments in the country. No one should show sympathy to Pakistan. Today, we have a different government at the Centre. So, before making any statement, people should think about the consequences," said he.

Ghosh went a step further, asking those "negative-minded people" to consider their own safety and security if they decide to go against the wind. Later, however, he became a little guarded and asked people not to take the law into their hands.

Ghosh also criticised Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for not visiting the families of the CRPF martyrs who were killed in the Pulwama blast. "I am alarmed to see that, unlike other chief ministers in India, neither she nor her ministers went to the airport to receive the remains," said Ghosh.

Recently, Trinamool Congress youth leader Sanku Deb Panda, who was interrogated in Saradha chit fund scam, joined BJP. Ghosh brushed aside the issue, calling it a low-key affair. He said that it was the central leadership decision to absorb Panda. "Is he a big leader?" Ghosh asked. He said nobody could join the BJP to get relief from the CBI. "CBI is doing its own work and it will not spare anyone," he said.
