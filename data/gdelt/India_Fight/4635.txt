Terror attacks on wane since 2014

Terror attacks in India’s hinterland decreased in a major way according to Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) data, as revealed by Minister of State Hansraj Ahir in a written statement in Parliament on Tuesday. In the last five years, the hinterland saw just six terror incidents: Three in 2014, one each in 2015, 2016 and 2018, and none in 2017. These incidents cumulatively claimed 11 civilian and security personnel, while seven terrorists were also killed.

However, the situation in Kashmir deteriorated. There were 1,708 attacks in five years in the Valley, killing 138 civilians and 339 security personnels, while 838 terrorists were also eliminated. “There is a close and effective coordination between intelligence and security agencies. A multi agency centre (MAC) has been strengthened and reorganised to enable it to function 24/7 for collection and sharing of information,” Ahir said.

He specifically mentioned Left-wing extremism (LWE) attacks having gone down over five years, going down from 1,091 in 2014 to 833 in 2018. The number of civilian deaths due to LWE went from 222 in 2014 to 173 in 2018, while LWE terrorists killed by security forces went up from 63 in 2014 to 225 in 2018.

The North East also saw a decrease in insurgency, from 824 in 2014 to 252 in 2018. The number of civilian deaths decreased from 212 in 2014 to 23 in 2018.
