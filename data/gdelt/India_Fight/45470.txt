VADODARA: Crime branch sleuths on Sunday arrested two men who had allegedly murdered a history-sheeter in Nava Bazaar last week.The cops arrested Deepak Makwana, a resident of New Sama Road and Rahul Rathod, who lives in Nava Bazaar. Police are yet to arrest five other persons including the prime accused Samir Pandya and Chirag Pandya who had masterminded the murder of Mayank Tailor.The cops had received information that duo had booked a room in a hotel near Amitnagar circle where the murder plan was hatched. “We learnt that Makwana had booked the room and all the accused met there on the day the murder was committed. He knew about the murder plan,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police (crime).“Rathod owns a shop in Nava Bazaar and is related to Samir. Samir had asked Rathod to keep an eye on Tailor’s movements as he used to visit Nava Bazaar often. Rathod had passed on all the information about Tailor to Samir over last few days,” Jadeja told TOI.On the day of the murder, Rathod called up Samir after seeing that Tailor was alone in Nava Bazaar.“Samir and Chirag, who were in the hotel, then reached Nava Bazaar and attacked Tailor with sword and other sharp weapons,” Jadeja added.Samir was furious with Tailor as the latter was having an illicit relationship with his wife. Samir was aware of the affair but he wasn’t getting an opportunity to extract revenge from Tailor.Samir and Chirag used to extort money from traders in Nava Bazaar. When asked about Mayank, the cops said that he too was into the business of extortion.The cops are on lookout for Samir, Chirag, Himmat Vaghela and two unidentified persons who were involved in the crime.
