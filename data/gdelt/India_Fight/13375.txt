Jaish-e-Mohammed doesn't exist in Pakistan, claims country's military spokesperson

Asked if Pakistan will make an "increased effort" in the aftermath of the February 14 Kashmir bombing that was claimed by JeM, Ghafoor said: "First of all, that claim has not been made from within Pakistan because Jaish-e-Mohammad does not (formally) exist in Pakistan. It has been proscribed by the UN (as well as) by Pakistan." His remarks were in contrast to the stance of Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who had admitted on February 28 that JeM chief Masood Azhar was in Pakistan and was "unwell to the extent that he cannot leave his house".

The Pakistan military has claimed that Masood Azhar's Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) that claimed responsibility for the Kashmir suicide bombing which killed 40 CRPF personnel "doesn't exist in the country". Major General Asif Ghafoor, the Director General of the Army's media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), made the remarks while talking to CNN on Tuesday.
