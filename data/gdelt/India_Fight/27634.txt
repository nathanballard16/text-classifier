Assam Rifles seized arms and ammunitions recovered from NSCN-IM cadres

Assam Rifles, acting on the tip off, launched a search operation in collaboration with a state police representative on May 24 and arrested National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) (NSCN-IM) over ground workers and cadres from Doyapur village of Dimapur district. Also the paramilitary force said these terrorists could have links with the killing of Arunachal Pradesh MLA Tirong Aboh, who was shot down with his son and nine others.

From the possession of those arrested, arms and ammunitions have been recovered that include two 12 bore guns, five pistols, 600 rounds of assorted ammunition and 34 pairs of combat uniform.

A statement issued by Assam Rifles said, those arrested have been identified as SS Leacy Hehuto, Mr. Chingni, OGW (employed in the house of SS Lieutenant Colonel Vikato) and Mrs Kheliho, wife of SS Leacy Samuel.

To carry out further investigation, those arrested were later on handed over to the West Police Station, Dimapur, along with the recovered items.
