After 4 BSF Jawans Killed In Cross-Border Firing, No Exchange Of Sweets For Eid At Wagah Border

Amid heightened ceasefire tensions, the border peace situation remains on the edge. After multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces, the Border Security Force and the Pakistani Rangers did not exchange sweets at the Wagah border on the occasion of Eid this year, news agency ANI reported.

Earlier this week, four BSF soldiers were killed in cross-border firing in Chambliyal sector of Jammu and Kashmir. Indian security forces had also fired in retaliation, a BSF official said.

Two border security force personnel, including an officer, were killed when Pakistani Rangers targeted Indian posts along the International Border on June 2.

This comes weeks after the Director General of Military Operations, or DGMO of India and Pakistan agreed to "fully implement" the ceasefire pact of 2003 in "letter and spirit".

Government said that there have been more than 1000 ceasefire violations from the Pakistani side this year.

"We have maintained that the ceasefire violation by Pakistan is used as a cover to infiltrate terrorists into our territory and we have seen the results of such infiltrations in the past," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

Close to 40,000 people living along the International Border (IB) in Jammu, Kathua and Samba districts were forced to leave their homes amid heavy firing and mortar shelling in Pakistani troops last month.
