Many policemen were hurt in the stone pelting. Soon more cops arrived to tackle the mob that had gathered there by then. However, they were also faced with fierce brick-batting from the angry crowd. Police then resorted to tear gas and mild lathi-charge but when that also failed to quell the mob, they opened fire on the crowd in which one person was killed and two others were injured.

The mob caught hold of a number of cops and beat them with batons, rods, and bricks. More than a dozen cops, including one Trishul Pandey, were seriously injured and had to be rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment.

The deceased was identified as 30-year old Abhishek Kumar, aka, Chintu, son of one Baldeo Rai. Two of his associates who were also scraped by flying bullets were identified as Ajit Yadav and Tinku.

Angry villagers then blocked the Parsa-Punpun Road and Patna-Gaya Highway demanding arrest of the offending policemen and monetary compensation to the victim's family.

Security was heightened in the area and senior police officials were monitoring the situation closely.

Locals have filed an FIR against Pandey and other cops accusing them of murdering Chintu.
