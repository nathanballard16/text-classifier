India Ka DNA - 'Jab hamla hoga to goli ka jawab gole se diya jayega': Amit Shah on Balakot airstrikes

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Monday said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has shown that no terror attack will go unpunished and the country will give a befitting reply to all such attack.

"Jab hamla hoga to goli ka jawab gole se diya jayega (Will respond with bombs if attacked with bullets)," the BJP chief told Zee News Editor-in-Chief Sudhir Chaudhary at 'India Ka DNA' conclave.

When asked if the government had elections in mind when it ordered airstrikes in Pakistan's Balakot, Shah said he, as BJP president, did not ask this to the government. He, however, added that the timing of Pulwama attack was not decided by the government and it did not wait for counter-attack.

"Pulwama attack's timing was not decided by the government. It was carried out by Pakistan-supported terrorists. Should we have waited for elections to counter-attack? We will give a befitting reply to terror attacks," he said.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) had carried out airstrikes against terror camps in Pakistan's Balakot in February, 12 days after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were martyred.

"Narendra Modi's personality is about taking tough and quick decisions. India is the third country after USA and Israel to avenge the attacks on its soldiers," he said.

He said that people should always think about the security of the country and it was a good thing that it has become an election issue.

"Citizens of the country should always think about the security of the country. Country's security should be an election agenda. Every country must think about security and it should become criteria for voting," Shah said.
