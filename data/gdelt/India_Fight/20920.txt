Sadhvi Pragya picked to punish Congress for Hindu terror bogey: Amit Shah

BHUBANESWAR: On a day when his party named Malegaon blast accused Sadhvi Pragya as its candidate against Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh for the Bhopal seat, BJP chief Amit Shah projected the controversial choice as meant to punish Congress for raising the bogey of ‘Hindutva terror’.“Sadhvi Pragya’s nomination will ensure punishment for the mastermind of the conspiracy to raise the bogey of Hindu terror,” he said at a meeting in Odisha.Shah said those behind the alleged conspiracy to concoct saffron terror were guilty of defaming the Hindu community globally and said with such mindset, Congress was incapable of defeating terrorism “Can Rahul baba protect India? He and his party have tried to defame the country across the world by raising the bogey of Hindu terror,” Shah said, asserting that PM Modi was best suited to take on the challenge of terror.The selection of Sadhvi Praghya can sharpen the debate over “Hindu terror” considering that Digvijaya Singh was at the forefront of the campaign against it. The former MP chief minister had opposed UPA government’s stand that the Muslim youths killed in a shootout with Delhi Police at Batla House were members of Indian Mujahideen and had, at least initially, seemed to echo the suspicion that Hemant Karkare, chief of Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad who was killed during the 26/11 attacks, might have been eliminated by Hindutva extremists.Singh’s strident stand on saffron terror did not go down well with many in Congress, although Rahul Gandhi ’s purported statement in 2009 — part of the cache of American diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks — to the then US ambassador to India Timothy Romer created uncertainty about the party’s official stand on the issue. As per the US version of his conversation with Romer, Rahul identified radicalised Hindu groups, which sought to retaliate against terror attacks from Pakistan, as a “bigger security threat”.The statement of Shah who, according to BJP sources, was crucial in securing the Bhopal ticket for Pragya, indicate that all these could be part of the arsenal BJP is readying to use against Digvijaya Singh.
