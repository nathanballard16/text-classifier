All three were rushed to the primary health centre. Sonam (5) died at the health centre while Vijay (4) and Ayush (6) were referred to SRN Hospital. Vijay succumbed to his injuries at the hospital," the officer said.Vajpayee said preliminary investigation revealed the toilet was built by Vijay's father Shivpujan Bind with government funds. "The blast was caused by either a crude bomb or some explosive material. We are probing if Bind had knowledge of the same. If yes, we have to find out why he was stocking explosives. If no, we need to zero in on people who were using the toilet to store bombs," the officer said.
