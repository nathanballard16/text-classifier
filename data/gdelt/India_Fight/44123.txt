Aamir Khan to shoot at 100 locations for his next 'Laal Singh Chaddha'

Aamir Khan is gearing up for his next, Lal Singh Chaddha, which is the remake of award-winning Hollywood film Forrest Gump (1994). Earlier, it was reported that the superstar will lose around 20 kilos for his role and will sport a turban for some segments of the film. Now, we have learnt that the Dangal star will shoot at 100 different real locations across the country.

Says a source, “The script demands Aamir to showcase the journey of his life and that will need him to be in different locations each time. The actor does not believe in studio set-ups, and has asked his team to scout 100 locations across the country where they can shoot. Apart from Delhi, Gujarat, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, there will also be several states where Aamir will shoot for the first time. This way, he will also explore the country.”

The insider adds that the actor’s age in the project will span from his childhood to the 50s, and will show his memories with different people at varied places. “Hundred locations for any Hindi film is happening for the first time, and Aamir wants to show it in the best way possible. The process has already started and for the next one-and-a-half months, he will be engaged in finalising locations. He will start shooting for it from November 1,” says the source.
