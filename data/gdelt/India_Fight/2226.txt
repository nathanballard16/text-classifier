Chennai: In a shocking incident reported from Chennai, a young man has been arrested on charges of raping a woman from the Narikuravar community and murdering her as well as her 3-year-old child.

Narikuravars are called a gypsy community by some people and have lived on the margins of the society in dire poverty for centuries now. They make a living by making and selling beads and other small ornaments in local markets and temples.

In this tragic case, it so happened that a young man left his young wife and three-year-old child at home while he took his five-year-old son along with himself to sell the hand-ade wares in Pondicherry market. He had no idea that he was imperilling his wife and baby girl's life.

Neighbours of the couple became suspicious the next morning when the wife did not stir out of the house until pretty late. Gaining no response to their intense knocking, the neighbours broke open the door, only to discover the dead woman and child lying in a pool of blood. A grinding stone lay nearby.

The local police was informed. The police, headed by Ambattur deputy commissioner Eswaran, went to the spot. The bodies were sent to the government hospital for postmortem.

Soon, the police rounded up some suspects from the locality, for questioning. Those included a youth named Veerakumar aged about 21 who belonged to Vellore.

A police sniffer dog also caught the scent of Veerakumar. On questioning, Veerakumar admitted that he had raped and killed the Narikuravar woman and also killed her child by smashing their skulls with a grinding stone. He was produced before the magistrate and sent to prison.
