Pakistani prisoner stoned to death in Jaipur

Indian prisoners, on Wednesday, stoned to a death a Pakistani prisoner in Jaipur Central Jail. According to reports, the Pakistani inmate, identified as Shakirullah was being held at a jail in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan where he was brutally attacked, only days after a car bombing claimed 40 lives in Pulwama in Indian-held Kashmir. Shakirullah was reportedly being held on charges of espionage and fell target to two Indian prisoners allegedly protesting the terror attack, according to Indian media. Rajasthan inspector general of police in charge of prisons, Rupinder Singh, confirmed that Shakilullah had been murdered. The mysterious circumstances surrounding his death come amid mounting tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad. Indian authorities have levelled baseless allegations against Pakistan and threatened to isolate Pakistan at international level. There are increasing reports of threats from Indian nationalists to Pakistanis and Kashmiris living in India.
