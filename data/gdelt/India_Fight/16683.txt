Previous UPA govt should’ve acted after 26/11 Mumbai attack: Niramala Sitharaman

Nirmala Sitharaman has slammed the previous Congress-led UPA government for not taking any conclusive action after the 26/11 Mumbai attack.

Sitharaman indicated that the Indian Army at the time may have approached the government to take action against the matter. However, she said that there are "enough reasons to believe" that the government did not take a call.

"I have enough reasons to believe that armed forces did tell the govt at that time, if you want us to do something, we are ready but we want you to take the call,' she said.

Her reply came after leaders from opposition parties, especially Congress, slammed the BJP for politicising the recent tension between India and Pakistan.

Many other leaders have taken a dig at the BJP over the recent Indian Air Force (IAF) air strike on Balakot on a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan.

In retaliation, BJP leaders have been citing the example of how there was no action taken after the Mumbai 26/11 terror attack, which killed over 170 people.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his recent rallies, also highlighted the point and assured people that "New India" will not be afraid to take constructive steps to eradicate terror.

Tension started escalating between India and Pakistan after at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in a suicide bombing attack in South Kashmir's Pulwama region.

Following the incident, Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out airstrikes across the LoC, destroying a Jaish training camp in Balakot.

While Pakistan claims no one was killed in the airstrike, India maintains and has furnished proof that indicated the death of at least 250 soldiers.
