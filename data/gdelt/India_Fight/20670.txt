Indian Military Thwarting 'Daily' Pakistani Attempts to Breach Border – Reports

According to the newspaper, Pakistan's efforts have including encouraging BAT teams and militants from the terrorist groups Jaish-e-Mohammed* and Lashkar-e-Taiba* to wear civilian clothing in place of uniforms to carry out their actions, which include surprise attacks against Indian positions along the LoC.

The Economic Times' sources accused the Pakistani side of trying to violate the ceasefire along all sectors after tensions escalated in February following the Indian Air Force strikes in Balakot.

Tensions between India and Pakistan grew to their highest level in years starting in mid-February, when Jaish-e-Mohammed affiliated militants attacked an Indian police convoy in Pulwama, killing over 40 security personnel. The attack led India to carry out airstrikes in Balakot, Pakistan. The escalation led to an aerial dogfight in which at least one Indian MiG-21 was downed, and to weeks of skirmishes along the LoC between troops using small arms fire and artillery. At least 10 Pakistani civilians and 4 Indian civilians have been killed in the violence.
