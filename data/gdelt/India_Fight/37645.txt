Irrfan extends stay in London to expose his sons to theatre

Irrfan’s fans can barely wait for the actor to return to the big screen. The actor wrapped up director Homi Adajania ’s Angrezi Medium , which is his comeback film, sometime in July. The sequel to Hindi Medium, which also features Kareena Kapoor Khan and Radhika Madan in pivotal parts, was completed in two shooting spells, one each in Rajasthan and London. However, after completing his shoot, Irrfan decided to stay on in London for a few more weeks to spend quality time with his kids and wife, relishing summer in the English capital.A source close to the actor told BT that he has been exploring the nooks and alleys of the city like a typical traveller. “Irrfan’s sons, Babil and Ayan, insisted on spending time in London. Their school vacations are underway and so, Irrfan decided to expose his boys to London’s theatre culture. Over the last few weeks, he has taken them out for some of the best plays being staged in the city. Irrfan believes that it will help them broaden their understanding of art. The actor and his family are expected back in Mumbai in the second half of August.”
