Young Indians Helped Put Modi in Power. Can He Count On Them Again?

They agreed that the party’s attempt to rout out black money by invalidating most of India’s currency, known as demonetization, had not really worked.

But the question of whether Mr. Modi was responsible for his government’s more polarizing moments divided them.

Ms. Khichi, a senior who plans to work for the consulting company Deloitte after graduating, said “bad people” in Mr. Modi’s party were taking advantage of his popularity to insert religion into politics.

“It is not Modi who is promoting Hinduism,” she said. “It is the people behind him.”

Mr. Parmar raised the case of Gauri Lankesh, an Indian journalist and critic of the government, who was murdered in 2017 by members of a militant Hindu group.

After her death, a man who described himself on Twitter as a “Hindu nationalist” wrote: “One bitch dies a dog’s death all the puppies cry in the same tune.” Mr. Parmar pointed out that Mr. Modi was following that person.

“It means Modi is supporting him,” he said.

The third person in the classroom, Mr. Kirar, 23, said he was still undecided. Choosing between the B.J.P. and the Indian National Congress, he said, was like picking one of two snakes.

Regardless of which gets chosen, he said, “they are both going to bite you anyway.”
