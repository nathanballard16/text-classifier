Yogi Adityanath Wants To Kill 100 Naxals To Avenge Gadchiroli Attack That Killed 15 Jawans

Paying homage to those who died in the Naxal attack in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the sacrifice of the 15 police personnel will not go waste and will be avenged by killing at least 100 Naxals.

"This is a battle of the entire country and 130 crore countrymen are with our brave jawans," he said.

UP CM made these comments while addressing an election rally in the state.

At least 16 persons, including 15 security personnel, were killed in an IED blast triggered by Naxals in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli district. The Naxals also torched 25 vehicles belonging to a road construction contractor.

The incident took place when the state was celebrating its foundation Day, Maharashtra Diwas.
