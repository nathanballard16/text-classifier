Delhi: 24-yr-old beaten to death in Jahangirpuri

A 24-year-old man was beaten to death by six others in a revenge attack in Delhi's Jahangirpuri in the early hours of Monday, police said.

Bhisham Singh, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (north-west) told the Hindustan Times that the man was murdered after he and his friend had allegedly stabbed two local youngsters hours earlier, after a fight.

The deceased has been identified as Gaurav. Police said that earlier he was arrested in 2016 in a murder case.

"On Sunday night, Gaurav and his friend Satish got into a quarrel with two local residents, Rocky and Ravi, and stabbed them. The injured duo got medical assistance before returning with four other friends to seek revenge," said the officer.

Gaurav and Satish were caught by Rocky, Ravi and others in a lane in Jahangirpuri's D Block. While Satish managed to escape, Gaurav was caught.

The group of six men used bricks to bludgeon him to death before fleeing the crime spot, said the officer.

Gaurav's body was found in the morning. Police then registered a murder case. The investigators also spoke to Satish to understand the details.

"We have detained some suspects, but are yet to arrest the killers. We know most of their identities and we hope to arrest them soon," police said.
