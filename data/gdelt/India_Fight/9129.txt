In Occupied Kashmir, Indian troops in their unabated act of state terrorism martyred three more youth in Kulgam district on Sunday.

The youth were killed during a cordon and search operation launched by Indian army, paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force and Special Operation Group of police in Turigam area of the district.

The killings triggered massive anti-India protests in Turigam and adjoining areas of the district. Hundreds of youth assembled in Turigam and shouted pro-freedom and anti-India slogans.

In the meantime, a Deputy Superintendent of Police was killed and an army Major injured in an attack in the same area.

On the other hand complete shutdown marked by curfew-like restrictions was observed across the territory, today, against India’s brutal measures including mass arrest, killings and attempts to repeal Articles 35A and 370 of the Indian constitution.

Call for the strike was given by Joint Resistance Leadership comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik.

All shops and other business establishments remained closed while traffic was off the roads in all big and small cities of the Valley and in Banihal area of Jammu region.

Curfew-like restrictions were imposed in Srinagar and other parts of the Valley to prevent protests against the mass detentions. Mobile Internet service was reduced in many parts of the territory.

Indian police arrested APHC General Secretary, Ghulam Nabi Samjhi and dozens of Jamaat-e-Islami activists during continued mass crackdown operations on leaders of pro-freedom and religious organizations.
