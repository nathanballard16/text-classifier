Nakuul Mehta had a reunion with Ishqbaaaz actors Leenesh Mattoo, Shrenu Parikh & others as he shot his last

Ishqbaaaz is going to go off air on March 15, 2019, and while this piece of news came across as a shock to most of the fans, it did turn out to be true. The show recently saw a generation leap come in which wiped off the original cast barring Nakuul Mehta. Entering the show were a host of actors, and later, also joining in the show was actress Niti Taylor. While the show did receive mixed reactions post the generation leap, it is now eventually being pulled off air after a run of good 3 years.

And well, last evening, as the team shot its last, the original cast members including the likes of Leenesh Mattoo, Shrenu Parikh, Mahesh Thakur and others joined in. seeing them all celebrate the big day together was indeed nostalgic and we are wondering what it would be like if they ever collaborate for some other project. The team cut a cake on their last day, and they seemed to be in full cheer, despite the show seeing a closure.

Check out the video from the evening here:

Meanwhile, there were comments on the live how they are missing Surbhi around, and we wonder how it would be like to see the two together even if it is just for a party. The show has now wrapped up well, we are sure that the fans must be feeling nostalgic given the run that the show has enjoyed. In fact, there have also been reports that Nakuul and Surbhi might be collaborating together for the upcoming sequel to Sanjivani, however, there hasn't been any confirmation as yet.
