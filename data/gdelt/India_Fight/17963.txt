From Don To Dust: Western UP’s Most Dreaded Criminal, Sushil Mooch, Surrenders In Muzaffarnagar Court

In a major surprise for Uttar Pradesh (UP) police, the most dreaded don of West UP, Sushil Mooch, surrendered in the Muzaffarnagar court. Touted to be the man who pioneered organized crimes like murders and kidnapping in UP and Uttarakhand, Mooch carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on him.

It was in 2012 that he was majorly caught and incarcerated for a murder, 39 years after he committed his first crime. The 65-year-old don has 52 criminal cases registered against him in UP, Uttarakhand and Haryana, including 17 murder and 10 attempt-to- murder cases.

One of the major reasons for his ability to evade being arrested for so long was that he never carried a mobile phone and always travelled alone. He was, therefore, tough to identify in public.

Even on Saturday (30 March 2019) when he surrendered, Mooch was not recognised in the courtroom until he identified himself and turned himself in, reports Times of India.

He has been sent to judicial custody until 12 April 2019. Additional director-general (Meerut zone) Prashant Kumar said, "Considering his high profile, we are planning to move Mooch to a different district jail away from Muzaffarnagar."
