Heeralal was beaten to death in the agriculture fields.“The Dial 100 service received information about the incident and found the deceased with the dead peacocks. Heeralal’s accomplices were booked under relevant sections of Wild Life Protection Act,” Neemuch SP Rakesh Sagar said.The police have booked 10 persons for murder. Attempts were on to trace them.This is the second time during the last three days that people have taken up law into their hands. Two days ago, three bike-borne men, who tried to steal a goat from a Bhadwa Mata temple in Pipliya Raoji road area of Neemuch , were beaten up brutally. Video of the incident had also gone viral on social media.SP Sagar said it was unfortunate that people took law into their hands. “The Friday night’s incident seems to be a pure case of misunderstanding. The deceased and the attackers were from the same village. They mistook him for a burglar,” he said.
