Pakistan summons Indian envoy over ceasefire violation

Islamabad, Oct 2 : Pakistan on Wednesday summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia and lodged a protest over "indiscriminate and unprovoked firing" by Indian forces along the Line of Control.

According to Pakistan's Foreign Office, the alleged ceasefire violation took place on Tuesday, and it resulted in the death of one civilian while three others were injured, the Dawn reported.

"A 50-year-old woman, Noor Jahan, was killed on Tuesday from indiscriminate and unprovoked firing by the Indian forces in the Nezapir and Bagsar sectors. One woman and two men sustained injuries from the firing," a statement said.

Officials said it was the second time the Indian forces violated the ceasefire agreement in the past four days. On September 29, two civilians, including a woman and a teenage boy, were killed from shelling by the Indian forces. Three other civilians were injured.

Foreign Office Spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said the Indian forces had frequently been targeting civilian populated areas with "artillery fire, heavy-caliber mortars, and automatic weapons".

"This unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1,970 ceasefire violations," the statement said.
