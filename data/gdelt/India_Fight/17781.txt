‘Queen’ in cop avatar in ‘Mental Hai Kya’

New Delhi: Dressed as a cop on a bike, ‘Manikarnika’ star Kangana Ranaut was spotted shooting for next out-of-the-box ‘Mental Hai Kya’.

The first look of the film was out in March 2018 and since then the movie buffs have been longing for more.

The film stars Rajkumar Rao alongside Kangana. The duo last appeared together in Vikas Bahl’s ‘Queen’ in 2014.

‘Mental Hai Kya’ is directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Prakash Kovelamudi.

The screenplay of the film is written by Kanika Dhillon, who has written for Manmarziyaan, Kedarnath, Ra.One.

‘Mental Hai Kya’ was set to release on March 29 earlier but the dates have been shifted on Kangana’s request.

“After the success of Manikarnika, Kangana wanted to space out her next film. Mental Hai Kya was coming exactly two months after Manikarnika’s release, which implied that she would have to immediately dive into the film’s promotions. She requested the makers for a breather as the period drama had taken a toll on her,” as reported by a daily.

While Kangana is shooting for ‘Mental Hai Kya’, Rajkumar Rao is up for a horror-comedy ‘Rooh-Afza’.
