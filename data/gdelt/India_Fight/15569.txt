Christchurch attack: Turkish president shows Christchurch attack footage at campaign rally

Turkish authorities, along with Bulgaria and Croatia, have confirmed Tarrant, 28, had been to their countries in 2016-2018. Hungarian counterterrorism authorities also suggested Tarrant had visited but revealed no other information, and local media in Bosnia reported a 2017 trip there.

During his unprecedented, live-streamed shooting spree Friday in Christchurch, Tarrant exposed his apparent fascination with the religious conflicts in Europe and the Balkans – a volatile region that has been the site of some of Europe's most violent clashes.
