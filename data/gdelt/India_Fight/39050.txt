Sheikh Zakzaky Leaves Nigeria for Medical Care in India

Nigeria’s Muslim cleric Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky has been flown to India for medical treatment, Nigerian media reported on Monday.

A court recently granted him medical leave after his health condition has been deteriorating. He spent four years in detention along with his wife, who was also injured during a crackdown by Nigerian authorities in 2015.

The 66-year-old cleric, along with his wife Zinat, embarked on a journey to India on Monday, the Information Nigeria news outlet reported.

It added that earlier in the day, the couple was heavily escorted by armed security forces of Nigeria’s domestic intelligence agency, Department of State Services (DSS), from their residence in the city of Zaria to the airport in the capital Abuja, where they could fly to India.

Sheikh Zakzaky, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), is also being accompanied by some officials of security services as well as medical personnel, while traveling to India, the report further said.

The top cleric has been in detention since December 2015 after his home in Zaria was brutally raided by Nigeria’s forces, during which he was beaten and lost his left eye.

During the violent crackdown, three of his sons lost their lives, his wife sustained serious wounds and more than 300 of his followers were killed.

Sheikh Zakzaky was charged in April 2018 with murder, culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, disruption of public peace and other accusations. He has pleaded not guilty, vehemently rejecting all accusations brought up against him by his country’s authorities.

Last week, a Nigerian court granted the Muslim cleric bail so that he could fly to India for treatment.
