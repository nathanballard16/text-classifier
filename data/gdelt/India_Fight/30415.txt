New Delhi: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is trying to assert himself as the pre-eminent leader of the state ever since the NDA-led government was formed at the centre.With the BJP getting 303 Lok Sabha seats, not much was left for the NDA allies to remain relevant.However, in just a fortnight, the JDU president has got more eyeballs than any other NDA partner.This seems to be Nitish’s attempt to reposition himself to get the best of both worlds.First, Nitish refused to be part of the central cabinet as he was vocal about its symbolic representation.Next, within two days of that, he expanded the state cabinet, inducting eight new ministers, all from his own party. He did mention after the swearing-in that he had offered one seat to the BJP, but that the party had refused.Pashupati Kumar Paras, who became a minister on Nitish’s return to the NDA fold in 2017, is now an MP from Hajipur. LJP, the party Paras belongs to, was expecting a state cabinet berth in lieu of that vacancy, but Nitish did not even consider including the Ram Vilas Paswan-led party. “It is the prerogative of the chief minister and he has the right to include whosoever he wants in his cabinet,” Paras had said at that time.Concurrently, JDU vice president Prashant Kishor met with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , apparently to help her in chalking out a political strategy for the assembly elections two years later.A number of party leaders questioned the timing of this meeting and asked for an explanation from Kishor. It was expected that Kishor would explain on June 9 at the JDU national executive meet in Patna.Just before the meeting, however, Kishor met Nitish for an hour and they came together to the meeting venue. Nitish made Kishor sit next to him, sending a clear message and no one in the party raised the issue.“It is not Prashant Kishor who is working for Mamata Banerjee. It is a company and we have nothing to do with the company,” said JDU secretary general KC Tyagi. Within a week of the national executive meeting, Ajay Alok, who raised questions over Kishor’s meeting with Mamata, resigned as party spokesperson.After the Lok Sabha elections, Nitish eyes an opportunity in the non-BJP vote bank of the opposition.He is reinforcing his image as a social reformer, which has earned him followers among women and all caste groups in the state.On June 12, Nitish took the liquor prohibition drive to yet another level. He ordered all station house officers to give an undertaking that if liquor were to be seized in their area, then they would not seek a posting at a police station for the next 10 years.“Liquor prohibition has changed Bihar completely and women of the state have become our supporters,” said Tyagi. “They have voted for Nitish Kumar in large numbers.”There are nine Lok Sabha seats in Bihar where women’s voting percentage was more than 60% in the recently concluded elections. JDU contested four of that, winning three seats.The women’s vote bank is really important in the party’s scheme of things as a number of women- and girl-centric schemes have been announced.The state government gives Rs 54,100 in total to girls, at all stages of the lives ranging from birth to graduation.On June 14, Nitish announced an old age pension of Rs 400 per month to those aged above 60 years who do not get any pension or financial help under any scheme. This was another attempt by Nitish to present himself as a person who thinks and works beyond caste lines.In the last few days, he has also been trying to reach out to the minority community. From organising Iftar parties to taking a stand on Triple Talaq and Uniform Civil Code, Nitish Kumar has been vocal in his messaging to the community.“Our stand on Triple Talaq or Uniform Civil Code has been the same for years. There is nothing which we are trying. It is the media which is reading too much into it,” adds Tyagi.Those who know Nitish, however, see it as an attempt to position himself as acceptable to everyone. “It is exactly the same way he started in 2013 when he parted from the BJP,” said a senior JDU leader from Bihar.“For him, the most important task is Bihar elections next year and he wouldn’t let BJP drive him in the state.”He already has offers from rival Rashtriya Janata Dal . “If he decides to come we would welcome him,” said senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.For the time being, Nitish will keep the pot boiling before he takes a decision, although he said after the party meeting on June 9 that, “We are very much in NDA and would contest the 2020 elections together.”
