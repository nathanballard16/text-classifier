China Calls 2008 Mumbai Terror Attack ‘Notorious

China has described as “one of the most notorious terror attacks” the 2008 Mumbai killings for which Pakistan was blamed.

The statement was made in a white paper called “The Fight Against Terrorism and Extremism and Human Rights Protection in Xinjiang” released by the Chinese government on Monday, 18 March.

In the chapter “International Counter-terrorism Exchanges and Cooperation”, the white paper bracketed the Mumbai attack with the 2005 London bombings that killed 52 people, the Paris 2015 attack which left 132 dead and the 2017 Sinai mosque attack that killed 235 people.
