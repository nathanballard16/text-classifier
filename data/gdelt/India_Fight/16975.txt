Pune: In a sensational incident, a person was murdered in an act of revenge after his rival’s defeat in Grampanchyat election in Pune district. The deceased was husband of a woman candidate who won the Grampanchayat elections at Ambegaon Khurd in Pune district. The incident had taken place on January 13.

Police have arrested two people in this regard. The deceased has been identified as Balasaheb Vanshiv. He was husband of Minakshi BVanshiv, the newly elected sarpanch of Ambegaon Khurd. According to information, Balasaheb Vanshiv had gone for a walk with his friend Prakash Tilekar. While the duo was walking on the service road along Mumbai-Bengluru Highway, a speeding white car hit Vanshiv.

The driver of the car fled the scene along with the vehicle. Vanshiv sustained serious injuries in the mishap and was rushed to a hospital. However, he succumbed to the injuries during the course of treatment on Sunday.

His wife Minakshi Vanshiv, in her complaint, said it was not an accident and had suspected Avinash Kamble being behind the incident. After verification of CCTV footage of the spot, police detained Avinash Kamble and Nitin Thopte for questioning, following which they confessed to have committed the crime.

Minakshi Vanshiv had defeated Reshma Kamble, wife of Avinash in the recently held Grampanchayat elections.
