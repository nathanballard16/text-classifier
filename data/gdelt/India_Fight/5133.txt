Burglar Gang Kingpin arrested for attacking Cops

Ahmedabad: Burglar Gang Kingpin was arrested by Ahmedabad Crime branch on Friday night for firing at a Police team which had raided the hideout four months ago in Ahmedabad’s Naroda region.

Briefing the reporters, Deputy commissioner of police, Crime Branch Deepam Bharani said that kingpin Arvind Sinh had managed to escape during the operation to catch them at Singarva, TOI reports.

“Later he had also fired upon Rajasthan police team who had attempted to nab him. He was nabbed on a specific tip-off from Rajasthan. He is being brought to Ahmedabad,” he added.

According to DCP, the gang had reportedly fired more than 10 ten rounds at the police team led by PI Rajesh Suvera.

“We had recovered more than 450 live rounds from the hideout and had earlier arrested four accused in the case,” added a senior crime branch official.

The gang had come to the city to commit a series of crimes such as house break-ins and armed robberies but they were nabbed before they could execute the plan.

“We suspect that arrest of Sinh and his gang could lift a veil from other undetected house break-ins and robberies in the city,” said DCP Bhadran.
