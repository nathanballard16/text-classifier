2009 Manipur triple murder: HC upholds life sentence to convicted Naga militant

On February 13, 2009, Dr Thingnam Kishan Singh, sub-divisional officer of Kasom Khullen in Ukhrul district at Manipur, and five other officials were abducted by militants.

The Delhi High Court upheld the life imprisonment sentence given by a trial court to Naga militant Hopeson Ningshen for abducting and murdering three government officials in Manipur in 2009.

On February 13, 2009, Dr Thingnam Kishan Singh, sub-divisional officer of Kasom Khullen in Ukhrul district at Manipur, and five other officials were abducted by militants.

According to the CBI, on February 17 that year, the bodies of Kishan Singh, Y Token Singh and A Rajen Sarma were recovered from the banks of the Tuphau Kuki river. An investigation pointed towards the involvement of Ningshen, a self-styled Lieutenant Colonel in the NSCN-IM. He was arrested on May 25, 2009.

In its judgment passed on Wednesday, a bench of Justice G S Sistani and Justice Chander Shekhar upheld the trial court’s May 2014 verdict, saying “having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed, we concur with” the lower court’s findings.

“The evidence would show that all the three deceased were beaten so brutally that their heads got deformed…” the court said.

“The above finding is further strengthened by CFSL reports… In this backdrop, we are of the view that the appellant needs no leniency and deserves a stricter punishment,” it said.
