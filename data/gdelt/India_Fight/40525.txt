NEW DELHI: A special anti-corruption court on Thursday sent former Union finance minister P Chidambaram to CBI custody till August 26 in the INX Media corruption case. The Congress leader was taken to the court on Thursday afternoon after he was arrested by the CBI from his residence in New Delhi late on Wednesday.Here is a look at the reactions of political parties and leaders on Chidambaram's arrest-"The CBI court's decision to send him in remand makes it clear that it is a corruption case. There is a prime facie case and that is why the court has remanded him to the probe agency's custody. Therefore, the Congress accusation that it is political vendetta is wrong. In fact, justice is happening," Javadekar, also the information and broadcasting minister, said."The matter is sub-judice. Why is the Congress afraid? If he has committed no wrong, there is nothing to worry about. Law will take its own course," Joshi said."There are issues over illegal coal mining and it needs to be addressed. We would write to the chief minister to look into the matter," he added."The vindictive, selective and malicious manner in which former finance and home minister Chidambaram has been persecuted and prosecuted is nothing short of a brazen personal and political vendetta. Over the last two days India witnessed the broad daylight murder of democracy and the rule of law by a government hell bent upon using CBI and ED as personal revenge-seeking departments for the party in power," Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said."The Congress is working with a negative mindset. They have converted corruption into a revolution. This is for the first time that corruption is becoming a revolution. Till now, revolution was against corruption, now revolution is being carried out in favour of corruption," minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told PTI."Law enforcement agencies will do their work and courts will do their own work. But, the Congress party and its leadership is trying to convert corruption into a revolution," Naqvi added."There is evidence..," Union minister G Kishan Reddy said. Reddy said it was the court which will try the case, not the government and law will take its own course."He was arrested as he was not cooperating with the investigating agencies. He should have cooperated. There is proof and evidence against (him) as to who took money from whom and through which bank... total records are there..," he said."This is a political witch hunt by the present government and more particularly by the home minister Amit Shah. The home minister feels aggrieved. He was in 2010, arrested in cases involving murder post-Godhra incident," senior Congress leader M Veerapa Moily said."The Court really held a prima facie case, but ultimately what had happened is a different matter. The case was also shifted to Bombay Court from Gujarat. He was not allowed to enter Gujarat also for some time and now he is the Home Minister. During that time P Chidambaram was the home minister. So this is some sort of a tit for tat," he added."Law takes in own course. Chidambaram went to the court, but did not get relief. The Congress's act of blaming the central government is not proper as it is working without any vendetta," Chouhan told reporters."If someone has indulged in any wrongdoing, it should be probed. It hardly matters whether the wrongdoer is big or small," the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said while refuting the Congress's charge that Chidambaram was a victim of political vendetta."P Chidambaram is an economist, and a former home minister and finance minister. The manner in which he has been arrested is depressing. There are four pillars of democracy: democratic institutions, Election Commission, media and judicial system. The democratic system of our country is crying, yet the judiciary is not coming to its aid," West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said in a statement issued by the Trinamool Congress."The law will take its own course, but the manner in which it was done, the drama that ensued was completely objectionable," CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said."I saw on TV, the CBI officers scaling the walls (at Chidambaram's Delhi residence). I consider it as an insult to India. It is condemnable," said DMK chief MK Stalin.NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged it was the Modi government's "model" of "misusing" probe agencies to harass opposition leaders who speak up against it and added people will see through the developments.Chowdhary criticised the BJP government for pursuing vendetta politics against the party's leaders and said the former union minister was arrested as he was vocal on corruption by the saffron party leaders.The way Chidambaram was arrested late on Wednesday night is undemocratic and completely unacceptable, he said."Chidamabaram was constantly criticising the policies of the Central government and was pointing out their failures. The government is not able to face the criticism and so they want to suppress the opposing voices," said Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel.
