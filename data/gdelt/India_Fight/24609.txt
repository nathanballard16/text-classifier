I salute your courage: PM Modi tells India Today TV reporter in Bengal

Prime Minister Narendra Modi heaped praises on India Today TV journalist Manogya Loiwal for braving attacks during the Phase 4 of theLok Sabha elections in Asansol.



Speaking to the reporter during a rally in West Bengal’s Purulia, Modi said, I have heard a lot about your courage. The way you continued with your duties as a reporter and also as a daughter, is commendable. You braved the goons here, tolerated their attacks and continued with your duty.



I respect your courage from the bottom of my heart, he told the reporter.



The India Today TV reporter was attacked by goons in Asansol during the Phase 4 polling on April 29.

Spoke to @manogyaloiwal about issues concerning West Bengal. Do watch! https://t.co/XcVaIJQC9Q Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 9, 2019



Violence gripped Asansol on the polling day as BJP and Trinamool Congress workers clashed in several polling booths in the segment. BJP MP Babul Supriyo’s car was attacked while both BJP and Trinamool moved the Election Commission seeking action.



This is India’s election. But this happens only in Bengal. It is not Didi vs Modi, it is Didi vs people. I am surprised that every time there is an election phase, the Opposition or mahamilaawati jamaat band together with Didi, PM Modi told India Today TV at the Purulia rally on Thursday.



Earlier, addressing the Purulia public where Mamata Banerjee addressed a rally two days ago, PM hit back at her over her slap of democracy jibe. He said, I heard Didi wants to slap me but for Modi, that slap will turn into a blessing.



Speaking on the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, PM Modi said, The way in 1984 there was killing of Sikhs by Congress and then they fanned the fire. They even made one of the accused the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. But their families have been taken care of by us.
