One of our teams recovered gold worth Rs 50 lakh and silver valued at Rs 2 lakh from Khare's residence in Golden City locality on Hoshangabad Road," said Bhopal Lokayukta Superintendent of Police (SP) Irmeen Shah.

Two farm houses belonging to Khare in Raisen district were also searched, she said, adding that raids are likely to continue till Wednesday.
