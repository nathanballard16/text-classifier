1984 victims' lawyer HS Phoolka quits AAP, hands in resignation to Kejriwal

HS Phoolka, well-known lawyer who battled for victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, today said he had resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party.

He claimed that he handed over his resignation to Kejriwal and that the Delhi CM had asked him not to resign.

He wrote on Twitter: “I have resigned from AAP & handed over resignation to Kejriwal ji today. Though he asked me not to resign but I insisted. Will be briefing media tomorrow at 4pm at Press Club, Raisina Rd, New Delhi to explain the Reason of leaving AAP & my further plans.”



Phoolka had quit as leader of the Opposition in Punjab assembly after the Delhi Bar Council stopped him for appearing in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases against Sajjan Kumar and others. The 73-year-old had said: “Will not give up '84 carnage cases. Would rather quit as minister. My presence in anti-Sikh riots cases is important at this stage; that is why I decided to quit as the leader of opposition.”
