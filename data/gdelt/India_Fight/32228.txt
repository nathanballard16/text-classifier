PHOTOS: Kareena Kapoor Khan pulls off an all denim look as she heads to London & we are eyeing her jacket

Kareena Kapoor Khan has definitely been having a super busy schedule and the actress has been doing to and fro from London to Mumbai because of her work here and there. It was only earlier yesterday that she returned to Mumbai from London and hours later, that she is back at the airport heading out for London again. While she is shooting for Dance India Dance here, the actress will be seen along with Saif Ali Khan in Jawaani Jaaneman.

Kareena sported an all denim look for the airport and while she did look super chic once again, we can't get over how the look is almost same to what she wore while returning. While that's that, we sure do love that jacket of hers and all the work that's there on the sleeves. She kept it simple and casual as usual without any makeup and left her hair open. One can't begin to fathom the kind of busy schedule the actress must be dealing with. Check out the photos right here:

Meanwhile, Kareena has received a huge thumbs up for her work in Dance India Dance and she has been applauded for pulling off the role of a judge with much ease. On the first episode of the show, she made sure to win hearts and well, she continues to do so.
