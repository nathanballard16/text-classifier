CRPF constable cremated in Ghaziabad

CRPF trooper Vinod Kumar, who died in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir recently, was cremated in Ghaziabad's Patla town on Sunday with full state honour.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has announced a grant of Rs 25 lakh for his family and a government job for the martyr's wife. Thousands of people thronged the venue to pay their tribute to Kumar.

Constable Kumar had joined Central Reserve Police Force in 2004. He was among five security personnel who were killed in a gunfight with militants on Friday in Jammu and Kashmir's Handwara district.

Kumar is survived by his wife, a nine-year-old son and six-year-old daughter.
