Amitabh Bachchan has been busy with work commitments for quite some time now. After wrapping up Gulabo Sitabo with Ayushmann Khurrana, the actor was recently seen shooting for Nagar Manjule's Jhund. Apart from this, Big B has Ayan Mukerji's Brahmastra and Rumi Jaffery's Chehre in his kitty.

If the actor is winning the hearts of millions of fans with each of his films, he is also getting recognition for his immense contribution to cinema.

On September 24, Amitabh Bachchan was "unanimously selected" for the Dada Saheb Phalke Award this year.

Expressing his gratitude, Amitabh Bachchan took to his blog to share his feelings on the big win. The actor said that he was overwhelmed by the love, but at the same time, he felt that he is "not worthy" of the prestigious honour.

"The overwhelming love and appreciation from the moment of the declaration of the DPA (Dada Saheb Phalke Award) has been most humbling... It numbs you into a block of ice that has been kept away from the warmth of its melting for ages... cold dry and blocked that is how you feel on its happening. Then you succumb to it and begin to acknowledge its presence and worth and its delivery," he wrote.

T 3298 - There is a paucity of words searching a response .. for the generosity of words that pour in ..

I am but deeply grateful and most humbled .. my sincerest gratitude ..
