370, 35A repeal likely to face legal hurdles

Faced with criticism over its inept handling of Jammu and Kashmir during its first term, the new NDA government will have an uphill task as the BJP’s election manifesto promised abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, annulling of Article 35A and return of Kashmiri Pandits to their home state.While the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A may face legal hurdles, ensuring safety of pilgrims during Amarnath Yatra starting on July 1 and extension of President’s rule beyond July 3 will be the first tests for the new government in the militancy-ridden state.A cabinet note on extension of President’s rule in J&K will be sent to cabinet secretariat by next month and will have to be passed by both houses of Parliament. If approved, the state will come under Centre’s rule for another six months, during which the Centre plans to hold assembly elections, said officials. While the Election Commission of India will decide on the dates for elections, the home ministry will be responsible for ensuring security of candidates in the Valley.J&K has been without an elected government since the PDP-BJP coalition collapsed in June 2018, when the BJP snapped ties with the PDP. The state was placed under Governor ’s rule on June 19, 2018 and was brought under President’s rule on December 19 last year.“In J&K, the topmost priority for any government is to restore normalcy. If we are able to bring peace and development to all the regions, other issues will get resolved on their own,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.During the past five years, J&K witnessed unprecedented violence, with more than 300 militants being gunned down in the Valley in 2018. Incidents of stone pelting against security forces and use of pellet guns against protesters drew sharp criticism. According to details available with the home ministry, local recruitment of youths in the Valley is at an all-time high. Last year, 217 local youths took to militancy, up from 126 in 2017, 66 in 2016 and 53 in 2015. This year, 45 youths are believed to have picked up arms.
