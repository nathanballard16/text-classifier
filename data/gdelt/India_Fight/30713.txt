The Taj Mahal will start charging tourists for staying over three hours

If you’re planning a trip to India to visit the Taj Mahal, you’re going to want to master the art of efficiency first. Taj Mahal authorities will soon begin charging tourists who linger for more than three hours in order to combat the negative effects of overcrowding at the popular site. Last year, authorities limited the number of daily visitors and raised the entry fee dramatically, and this new regulation is designed to facilitate a smooth, manageable flow of visitors.

To track visitors entering and exiting the Taj Mahal, turnstile gates have been installed at the entry points, so authorities can more easily monitor how long people are spending at the attraction and manage the crowds. Vasant Swarakar, the superintending archaeologist, told The Times of India, “If tourists exceed their time limit of three hours, they will be charged an extra amount equivalent to the ticket, which will have to be paid at the exit gate. Entry time will also be enforced and if tourists don’t arrive at the slotted time, they will not be allowed entry and will have to buy a new ticket.”

Three hours seems like a pretty reasonable amount of time to view the attraction in its entirety, and, of course, there are ways to admire the wonderful exterior away from the crowds that allow smitten visitors to take it all in.
