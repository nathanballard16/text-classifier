Two teenage sisters were raped at gun point by four men on Tuesday evening near India's north eastern city of Muzaffarnagar, police allege.

The sisters, aged 13 and 15, were looking for their mother in a sugarcane field when the four men attacked them in the Kaserwa village, Superintendent of Police (Rural) Alok Sharma said on Wednesday.

Four men said they would shoot the girls if they cried for help or told anyone about the attack, they say.

The men have been charged and arrest warrants have been issued, Mr Sharma added.

It comes as the latest in a string of rapes on minors in India's Uttar Pradesh region in recent weeks.

The region, which sits on the edge of the country along the Nepalese border, may introduce increased policing in an attempt to stop the attacks.

Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked police to amp up foot patrols in rural areas in order to protect minors.

The attack comes just a day after an eight-year-old girl was gang raped in the in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday evening.

Two teenagers, neighbours of the girl, aged 15 and 16, are in custody over the attack.

The child was attacked when she had gone to bathe in the village canal on Tuesday afternoon.

The two juveniles are alleged to have dragged her to a secluded spot and raped her before leaving her bleeding in pain to stagger home to her parents who took her to hospital.

Doctors suspected the girl had been raped and after she explained what happened, hospital staff contacted police who immediately arrested the two boys.
