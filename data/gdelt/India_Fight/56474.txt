Gatherings banned in parts of Delhi

NEW DELHI: Indian authorities banned large gatherings in parts of the capital on Wednesday as they stepped up efforts to contain a week of nationwide protests against a citizenship law seen as discriminating against Muslims, reports AFP.

The ban in some Muslim-dominated districts of New Delhi, where police had been injured in clashes with protesters on Tuesday, followed the arrests of hundreds of people elsewhere in India.

The protests against the legislation—which fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslims from three neighbouring countries—have claimed six lives so far in the northeastern state of Assam.
