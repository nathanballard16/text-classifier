Seven Booked in India for Killing Neighbour’s Rooster

In a bizarre incident at least seven people have been booked by police in the Indian state of Bihar after a woman’s rooster was found dead following her quarrel with neighbours.

According to the police, Kamla Devi, a resident of a remote village in Bihar, had a dispute with her neighbour.

“Following the long happening dispute, the two parties fought again over a matter two days ago. During the scuffle, the neighbour snatched Kamala Devi's pet rooster and killed it", a senior police officer said.

A post-mortem of the rooster at a local veterinary hospital revealed, it had been killed with a sharp object.
