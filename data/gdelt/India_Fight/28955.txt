Islamabad: Barely a week after S Jaishankar took over as Sushma Swaraj’s successor in the Ministry of External Affairs, Pakistan sent a letter to the External Affairs office stating that Islamabad would want to hold talks with New Delhi on ‘all important matters’.

In the congratulatory letter to the MEA, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that his country is committed towards establishing peace in the region, news agency PTI quoted media reports as saying.

Jaishankar was a surprise inclusion in the high-profile Narendra Modi Cabinet as the entire nation was speculating as to who would replace Swaraj as the new MEA. Jaishankar took oath along with other ministers on May 30 and assumed office on June 1.

In his letter, Qureshi said “Islamabad wants to hold talks with New Delhi on all important matters...remains committed to all efforts to establish peace in the region”, PTI quoted The Express Tribune as saying.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has also letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating the same requests as Qureshi wrote to Jaishankar. Khan raised the Kashmir issue as well in his letter.

Relations between the two countries have been on tenterhooks since the Pulwama attacks February 14 after Pakistan-based terrorist group Jammat-ud-Dawa (JuD) conducted a dastsrdly terror attack in Kashmir, killing 44 CRPF jawans. Ten days later, India launched massive airstrikes in Pakistan territory and bombed terror havens in Pakistan’s Balakot, destroying the JuD’s training camps, which the Pakistani authorities deny till date.
