Ahmedabad: Biker dies after hitting cows, booked

AHMEDABAD: A 28-year-old biker who was killed after two cows suddenly came in his way on an Ahmedabad highway last September — has been booked for ‘rash driving’ by Ahmedabad police . However, this is not the only such FIR and a top traffic police official said it would be hard to trace the owners of animals responsible for such accidents.Sanjay Patel, 28, died after two cows came in the way of his motorcycle and the collision hemorrhaged his brain. Yet the city’s traffic cops have made Patel’s father file an FIR against his own deceased son, under IPC, which affirms that ‘rash driving’ was responsible for his death.The traffic department’s DCP (administration), Tejas Patel, said: “Across the 14 traffic police stations in the city, not a single case has been registered under the provisions of accidental death.” He said so far only FIRs under various sections of road accidents have been registered.
