The United States, Britain and France have moved a fresh proposal in the United Nations Security Council to designate Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

The fresh proposal was moved on Wednesday by the three permanent veto-wielding members of the 15-nation Security Council, our New Delhi correspondent reports.

The Security Council Sanctions Committee will have 10 working days to consider the fresh proposal submitted by the three members.

The proposal is the fourth such bid at the UN in the last 10 years to list Azhar as a global terrorist which will subject him to global travel ban, asset freeze and arms embargo.

The previous attempts to have Azhar declared as a global terrorist by the Security Council was blocked by China, a close ally of Pakistan.

Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14 when 40 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed.

Jaish-e-Mohammed is seen as the mastermind of a number of terror attacks in India including the attack on Indian parliament in 2001, the attack on an Indian air base in Pathankot and on an Indian army camp in 2016.
