Recently seized bikes clog police stations, Lalbazar orders auction to free up space

KOLKATA: Success can come with its own set of problems, Kolkata Police has found out at its own expense.Cops launched a crackdown on rogue bikers on June 19, three days after the late-night incident involving model Ushoshi Sengupta’s app-cab driver on the streets of Kolkata. Cops have seized 468 bikes over the last 20 days, prosecuting over 16,000 bikers and making the streets a lot safer for late-night driving.The success, however, has come at a price: the new seizures have clogged police’s roadside seized-vehicle dumps near many police stations. So officials have now been forced into ordering a crash e-auction of its inventory of vehicles seized earlier only to free up space for the bikes seized in the recent drive.Lalbazar wants to sell off 631 two-wheelers plus a few cars as well, with the e-auction planned between 12 noon and 3 pm on July 19 and inspection of vehicles allowed till July 16. All the bikes and other vehicles being auctioned are those without any claimant or having documents that may not be in order. The move, officers say, will help clear about half the space in the dumps. Seized vehicles from at least 15 police stations have been identified for the e-auction. Beniapukur, Kasba and Shyampukur top the list of police stations sending vehicles for this e-auction; all three have also seized the maximum number of two-wheelers over the past several days, indicating which areas trouble cops the most. Cops have actually been attacked thrice in Beniapukur in the recent past.“We do keep selling off old vehicles to clear the dumps. But this e-auction comes at a trime when we have made a significant number of seizures and will help us intensify our drive without having to think of space constraints,” said a senior officer.
