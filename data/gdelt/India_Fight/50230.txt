Four injured in group clash over inter-faith live-in couple

Rajkot: Four persons were injured in a clash between two groups that erupted over a live-in relationship between members of two different communities in Tithava village of Wankaner taluka in Morbi district on Sunday night. Police arrested 15 persons in this connection.

The police said the members of Muslim community were incensed ever since Wahida Shahmadar (25) had entered into a live-in relationship with Savji Koli (27).

“Shahmadar had eloped with Koli, three months ago. On Sunday night, when they returned to Tithava village, Shahmadar’s family members went to Koli’s house to pick her up. It was then that the clash erupted between the members of Shahmadar and Koli’s families,” said R C Ramanuj, sub-inspector with Wankaner taluka police station.

The clash left four persons injured. The police swung into action and arrested 10 members from Shahmadar’s family and five members from the Koli family.
