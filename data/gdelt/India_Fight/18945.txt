Imphal (Manipur): (PTI) BJP president Amit Shah on Friday said that Narendra Modi has made the country more secure by becoming the first Prime Minister to destroy terrorist camps across the borders.

He spoke highly about airstrikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan following the Pulwama incident in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

Such retaliation made the country third in the world after the US and Israel to avenge any loss of its soldier's lives, Mr Shah said while addressing a public rally at Wangjing locality, as part of an election campaign for BJP's Outer Manipur candidate Benjamin Mate.

Making a fulsome praise of five years of Modi government, the BJP chief remarked that “from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari and from Gujarat to Assam there are echoes of Modi's name which meant that the people are with him”.

Hitting out at the Congress, Shah said the price of essential items had sky-rocketed under the Congress rule, owing to incessant bandhs and strikes, but the incumbent government has made the state blockade-free.

Heaping praise on the BJP-led government in Manipur for its development work, Shah said Chief Minister Biren Singh can be termed “a true chowkidaar” (watchman) as he has served in the Border Security Force.

Mr Shah highlighted various changes brought by N. Biren Singh's government in the last two years.
