Aarey Protests: SC Orders Status Quo on Cutting of Trees

In a victory for green activists, the Supreme Court today ordered status quo in the Aarey tree felling case, ordering the Maharashtra government not to cut down any more trees till the next hearing on October 21. Observing that it “appeared Aarey was a forest at some point of time”, the court asked the state government to submit a status report on the number of trees felled so far and the compulsory afforestation by the Mumbai metro. The court was hearing petitions by activists who are protesting against the felling of over 2,600 trees in Aarey colony for the construction of a Mumbai Metro car shed.Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and Aarey forest case petitioner Rishabh Ranjan at Supreme Court in New Delhi.
