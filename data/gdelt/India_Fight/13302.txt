TDP lodges complaint against Telangana police

Party sees conspiracy to steal data to benefit the Opposition YSR Congress Party

The TDP has lodged a complaint with Guntur Rural SP S.V. Rajasekhara Babu urging him to inquire into the data theft accusing the Telangana police of misusing its official position to facilitate the illegal and clandestine activity of the YSRCP.

Party State president and Minister K. Kala Venkata Rao said in a memorandum it was a case of conspiracy hatched by the YSRCP leaders and senior police officials of Telangana to steal the data belonging to the TDP to cripple the party activities and also to intimidate the cadre for furthering the political prospects of the YSRCP.

The conspiracy was hatched in Amaravati before February 23 and it was intended to engineer en masse requests for deletion of names from the voters’ list, which was established by several applications being generated from the same IP addresses.

Civil Supplies Minister P. Pulla Rao, Rajya Sabha MP K. Ravindra Kumar, MLC Dokka Manikya Vara Prasad and MLA G. V. Anjaneyulu accompanied Mr. Venkata Rao.

It was in pursuance of that plot that the Telangana police raided the premises of the IT Grids (India) Pvt. Ltd. on February 23 and interacted with D. Ashok, Director and other employees, when they forcefully downloaded certain information and also took away some computer systems, hard discs etc., on the pretext of an ongoing investigation without even revealing any FIR number or showing a search warrant.

Listing the series of developments, Mr. Venkata Rao said senior police officers, leaders of the YSRCP and some political leaders whose identity would be revealed after investigation, had conspired to harm the TDP. The modus operandi was to hold press conferences and send messages that notices would be issued even to the A.P. police. As apprehended, the stolen data had been handed over to the YSRCP activists as agreed in the conspiracy.
