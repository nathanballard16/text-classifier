Britannia appoints Lowe Lintas as its creative agency for Timepass

Britannia has appointed Lowe Lintas to handle the creative mandate of its salted snack, Timepass. The account was won post a multi-agency pitch. Lowe Lintas works with Britannia for other brands under its portfolio.

Jayant Kapre, business head – adjacent and new business, Britannia Industries, said, "In line with Britannia’s vision of being a total foods company, it was a natural move for Britannia to make an entry into this category. We looked at the tremendous growth of the snacking category over the past half-decade. Our approach will be not just to create an innovative portfolio of products, but one that is represented by a memorable brand persona. We look forward to working with Lowe Lintas in gaining a meaningful entry into this competitive category."

Hari Krishnan, president, Lowe Lintas, said, "We are Britannia’s lead creative partner and to be chosen for a new category is a vindication of our strengths in consumer understanding, strategy and our creative firepower. Snacking is a category where consumer demand is triggered by two types of hunger – mouth hunger and stomach hunger. Most of the packaged snacks fall into the Mouth Hunger category and is generally an addictive and/or mindless activity. Based on this insight, we have worked with the Britannia team on the strategy, brand name and communication and that’s how the brand name Timepass was frozen. We look forward to developing some exciting and Timepass work."

The agency's Bengaluru office will handle the account.
