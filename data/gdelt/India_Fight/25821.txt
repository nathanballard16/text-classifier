Opinion : An Indian candidate called Mahatma Gandhi’s killer a patriot. Modi must drop her now.

Even before her outrageous comments on Gandhi, Thakur had already crossed all norms of civility and decency. The very fact that the BJP fielded a candidate on bail from terrorism charges was bad enough. Then she insulted Hemant Karkare, a police officer who was killed while leading anti-terrorist operations during the 2008 Mumbai attacks. While investigating the bomb blast that Thakur is charged in, Karkare traced a motorcycle used in the attacks to her. On the campaign trail, Thakur declared that Karkare had been killed because she “cursed” him, and that his death was “karma” for treating her badly.
