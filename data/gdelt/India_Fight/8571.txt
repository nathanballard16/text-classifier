Pakistan reimposes ban on Islamist charities linked to militant leader

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has re-instated a ban on two charities linked to the founder of an Islamist militant group that has carried out attacks in India, the interior ministry said on Friday.

The ban comes as Pakistan faces international pressure to act against militant groups, amid escalating tension with its nuclear-armed neighbour, India, following a suicide bomb attack on Indian police in the disputed region of Kashmir.
