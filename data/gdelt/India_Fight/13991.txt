After arrest of gang of 4, actor calls press conference to say he is not their targetActor Yash managed to drag the attention on to himself in the case where CCB police arrested four rowdies on Thursday evening. The CCB had constituted a special team after the recently arrested rowdy, Bharat aka Slum Bharat, had allegedly confessed that a team of rowdies was planning to murder a Kannada film actor.Two years ago, Yash had filed a complaint with the police that he was receiving death threats. Last year, another actor, Arjun Dev (who acted in Yugapurusha), filed a similar complaint. On Friday, there was speculation among fans of top stars about who the supposed victim was. There were news reports mentioning the name of actor Arjun Dev. However, Yash called a press meet on Saturday evening to announce that news reports were suggesting that it was him (Yash) and it was not true.Similarly, a drunken bluster by another rowdy Cycle Ravi about his intention to murder an actor turned out to be a false alarm. Yash had come into focus in that case as well even though the police had ruled out any such plot.Yash said that he was not in Bengaluru for the last four days and he could not have been the target of rowdies arrested in Seshadripuram on Thursday. He said that there was competition among actors but not to the level that anyone would try to eliminate another. “This will send a wrong signal about our industry to others,” he said. On Thursday evening, the CCB police arrested four persons who were allegedly planning to murder an actor and were carrying. Nitesh, Nityananda,and Prithviraj were the four arrested. They were allegedly acting on the behest of Slum Bharat who is already in custody.
