Balakot airstrike killed 10 trees, it was painful: Imran Khan at UNGA

Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday claimed that Indian Air Force killed 10 trees in Balakot airstrike.

The airstrike, which came in the aftermath of Pulwama terror attack on February 14, had inflicted heavy casualties in Pakistan-based terror camps run by Jaish-e-Mohammed. JeM had claimed responsibility of the Pulwama terror attack, which killed 40 CRPF personnel.

However, PM Imran Khan on Friday reiterated his country's stand that there were no terror camps at Balakot and Indian Air Force fighter jets only hit trees, which he said was painful.

Addressing the world leaders at United Nations General Assembly in New York, Imran Khan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi used 'false claims' about Balakot to further his political gains during the election campaign.

"Modi's campaign was based on the lie that they killed 350 terrorists while they killed only 10 trees, which was quite painful because we are planting all these trees," Imran Khan said.

A word cloud of Pakistan PM Imran Khan's UN General Assembly address

Imran Khan, in his address, claimed that Pulwama attack was carried out by a 20-year-old Kashmiri boy who was the son of a man radicalised by the security forces, "but they blamed us."

The Pakistan PM claimed that abrogation of Article 370 from Kashmir will further radicalise the Muslims in India and it is likely that there would be another Pulwama.

In his 50-minute rant against India, PM Imran Khan directly targetted PM Modi and once again brought up the threat of a nuclear war between the two nations.

Imran Khan's speech also talked about climate change, money laundering, tax havens and Islamophobia.
