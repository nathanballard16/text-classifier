They had buried the body in a vacant place behind the house.”Nageshwari, 37, a resident of Bengaluru, told TOI: “My mother was staying alone four years ago after a quarrel with my brother C Nagendran and his wife Poongodi. She was working in a private spinning mill at Manickapuram in Palladam and staying in its hostel facility. So, when we heard that she went missing in May, we suspected foul play. We thought that she was angry with us and working somewhere.”“My mother had called us to say that Poongodi and Kannammal had invited her for the head-tonsuring ceremony of her grandchildren. It seemed that she joined them for the event while Nagendran was staying in our house and working along with my husband Krishna. Following the ceremony, she never picked up our mobile phone calls,” Nageshwari said.“When we queried about it, Poongodi and Kannammal said she was upset that I and my brother did not take care of her properly, and she wanted to live alone. So, we did not search for her, and only after arrest of the mother-daughter duo, we suspected murder and lodged a woman missing complaint,” she added.Though Nagendran was not aware of his mother’s murder, he joined with his wife Poongodi and mother-in-law Kannammal to murder Selvaraj and Vasanthamani. His friend Elango was also involved in the murder, police said.
