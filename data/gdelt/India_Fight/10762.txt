Gujarat: Flights delayed, cancelled due to airspace restrictions

Several flights originating from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (SVPI) were cancelled due to airspace restrictions on Wednesday. The flights were Srinagar-, Leh-, Jammu- and Chandigarh-bound, among other locations.



Amid the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and after IAF carried out pre-dawn air strikes in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), nine airports were closed for civilian air traffic. This resulted in several cancellations and delays caused due to rerouting of aircraft.



Flights to Chandigarh, Srinagar and Dehradun were cancelled on Wednesday. Two international flights were diverted to Ahmedabad. Officials at Ahmedabad airport remained tight-lipped about the cancelled flights. A source, requesting anoymity, said, "Close to 10 flights from Ahmedabad were affected. But for the first time, passengers did not create a ruckus owing to the situation. All the flights to Jammu, Chandigarh, Srinagar and Jaisalmer were cancelled."



A statement from SpiceJet said, "Passengers whose flights were cancelled on February 27 due to airspace restrictions have been provided a full refund or have been rebooked on alternate flights of their choice at no extra charge." Other airlines also took to the social media to announce amount refund.
