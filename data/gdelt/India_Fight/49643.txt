Miscreants attack shop, injure two

Ludhiana: A shop owner and his employee were injured after a group of miscreants allegedly attacked their shop in Payal on Wednesday. The injured were identified as Vikas Kumar and Chotu.

Police said the attack was carried by the members of a group, who had come with an intention to target their rival group but could not succeed. Their rivals had come to appear in court in a case of assault on Wednesday. Both the groups had a dispute over posters related to Kabaddi tournament.

Police said because of the police presence the members of the group could not attack their rivals as they had planned. However, seemingly out of frustration, they attacked the shopkeeper and his employee without any reason and also damaged the articles at the shop. DSP Payal Hardeep Singh Cheema said a case has been registered against the accused. “What exactly prompted them to attack the shop would be ascertained after the arrest of the accused,” he said.
