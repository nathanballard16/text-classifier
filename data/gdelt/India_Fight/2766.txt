Army to brief defence ministry on Bipin Rawat's restructuring plans

The Ministry of Defence will get an important briefing from the Army on General Bipin Rawat's plans for restructuring the bloated Indian Army.

"Senior Army officers will give a presentation to the defence ministry on restructuring of the force and its headquarters in the capital," official sources in the government told India Today.

The plans are the brainchild of Army Chief General Bipin Rawat who wants to rightsize the Army for future battles.

The presentation will be made by two lieutenant generals who were part of the studies done on restructuring of the force and reorganisation of the Army headquarters.

The defence ministry and the Army headquarters have ordered separate studies for restructuring and resizing the 1.2 million-strong Army to save money for modernisation of forces.

The defence ministry has also ordered a study through the National Security Advisory Board under former Northern Army commander Lt General DS Hooda to do a parallel study on the reorganisation and right-sizing of the force.

Hooda has suggested creation of new cyber and information warfare units along with the creation of reserve forces to save around 20 per cent of the manpower in the forces.
