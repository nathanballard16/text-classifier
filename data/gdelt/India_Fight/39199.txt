Are Bhumi Pednekar and Jackky Bhagnani the new love birds in B town? Find Out

Bollywood is often plagued with rumours of film stars and their love life. From Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor to Sushant Singh Rajput and Rhea Chakraborty, there is never a time that goes without one, possibly in love, couple making headlines. And this latest scoop according to a report will leave you wondering how, where and when did these two Bollywood actors start warming up to each other. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, actress Bhumi Pednekar and actor, producer Jackky Bhagnani have been feeling the love lately.

The report reveals that Bhumi Pednekar's daily outing to the gym often does not end up with the actress heading home. Instead, Bhumi often exits the gym and zooms off in a car which belongs to Jackky Bhagnani. Seems like the newest couple in B-town are choosing to keep their relationship under wraps for now.

It was not too long ago that Jackky was linked to his Mitron co-star Kritika Kamra. Whereas, Bhumi has been busy shooting back to back films. She recently was in Lucknow shooting for Pati, Patni Aur Woh alongside Kartik Aaryan and Ananya Panday. The actress's birthday on the sets was a huge celebration. Before that, Bhumi was busy with Saand Ki Aankh in which she will be portraying the role of a sharpshooter with Badla star Taapsee Pannu.

Saand Ki Aankh will be releasing this year in October and will be Bhumi's second film of the year after Sonchiriya.
