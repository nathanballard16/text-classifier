A local court in Shamli on Sunday declared Kairana MLA Nahid Hasan an absconder, clearing the way for police to begin proceedings to attach his properties.

According to police, the SP legislator is evading arrest in 12 FIRs, including those relating to attempt to murder and extortion. “A public announcement was made in Shamli today in which the people were informed of Nahid Hasan’s current absconding status. Eight cases against him have been filed in Shamli while four are registered in Saharanpur. Nahid Hasan is accused of threatening people from the weaker sections of society.
