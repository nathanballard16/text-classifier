Gujarat builder pays 33% of his Mercedes’s price for fancy number

AHMEDABAD: Rajkot builder Govind Parsana shelled out an eye-popping Rs 19.01 lakh to Regional Transport Office to get his favoured 0007 number. He paid the extra premium as the number 7, when written in Gujarati represents Ganesha, and he is a believer in the ‘Lord of Good Tidings’. Though Parsana says he hasn’t been able to fully realize the potential of his investment which cost him 33% of the price of his Mercedes “I spent Rs 19 lakh but RTO rules prohibit me from writing the number in Gujarati which denotes Lord Ganesha. Else, I am no James Bond fan to pay for 007 number,” he rues Parsana, who got this number for his previous three four-wheelers as well.Gujarat road and transport department officials confirmed that Parsana's bidding of Rs 19.01lakh is the highest ever in Gujarat. Officials say believers are paying heftier amounts to get numbers of their choice.Another case is Rajkot-based tours and travel operator Upendra Chudasama who paid the second highest bidding amount ion 2019 to win his lucky number-1! He got a GJ3LB0001 registration number.“I bought a Range Rover and paid Rs 8.53 lakh for my lucky number. This number is close to my heart; earlier too I paid Rs 3.5 lakh to buy the same number for my SUV,” he says.In Ahmedabad, the highest bidder for the series which opened in July this year was Classic Network Private Limited. “The firm paid Rs 6.71 lakh for 0001 number. This is the highest bidding in history of Ahmedabad RTO," said SP Muniya, Ahmedabad RTO. Other top bidders have paid Rs 1.36L to Rs 1.84L.Officials said there are maximum competition for numbers like 1, 7, 11, 9, 99. "Apart from that, people pay premium for numbers that match their birthdays, wedding anniversaries, child's birth and other such milestones in life. With e-bidding, the process records participation and hence the price tag has also increased," said Muniya.
