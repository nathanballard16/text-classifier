Mumbai: Youth duped of Rs 30,000 by fake travel agent

A 70-year-old travel agent duped man of Rs 30,000 by offering a fake job offer in the Middle-East and also providing him with fake airline ticket. The accused identified as Mohammed Hanif Mehboob Khan was arrested earlier this week by Sahar police. They got his custody from the Vashi police where Khan was arrested for a similar offence.

According to the police, the complainant Ashishkumar Prasad had settled in Mumbai two years back, and is a resident of Santacruz. Prasad who works in the air conditioner maintenance line got a WhatsApp message about RK Enterprises in Thane offering a job opportunity in Thane. The advertisement also claimed that the country was looking for migrant workers and it had the contact number of Khan attached within.

When Prasad got in touch with Khan, he assured that Prasad will be sent to Oman for the job of maintenance of air conditioners. "Prasad was asked to spend Rs 28,000 for the job opportunity, travel and other things. Prasad agreed to pay and the amount was transferred to Khan via different bank accounts that belonged to Parvez Alam and Laxman Prasad who were the friends of the victim.

On June 18, 2019, Khan gave the visa papers and on June 28 air tickets were sent to Prasad via WhatsApp. However, Prasad was stopped by the airport authorities as the ticket was found to be counterfeit," said an officer.

Prasad then approached the police, and gave all details about Khan. Police raided Khan's office in Thane, but found no evidence of his business activities. It was later found that Khan was held by the Vashi police following which his custody was handed over to the Sahar police.

"We suspect that more victims must have been duped by Khan but further investigation is underway." the officer added.
