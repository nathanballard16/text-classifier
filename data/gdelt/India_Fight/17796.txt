The 33-year-old actor also announced that the Meghna Gulzar-directed film will release on January 10 next year.

“A character that will stay with me forever.#Malti Shoot begins today! Releasing-10th January, 2020,” Deepika posted on her social media accounts alongside the picture of her look from the film.

The movie, which is based on the life of acid attack survivor and activist Laxmi Agarwal, is also Deepika’s debut production venture.
