Ahmedabad: Man held for raping 9-yr-old daughter

A 32-year-old man has been arrested by Ramol police on Wednesday for allegedly raping his nine-year-old daughter.



According to police, the incident took place on the afternoon of June 17, after he fought with his wife and she left home in anger. The man and his daughter were alone inside the house; the child's grandmother was sitting outside.



He first molested his daughter, and when she resisted he threatened to beat her up if she raised an alarm. The man raped his daughter and forced her into an "unnatural act of sex" say police.



Unable to withstand the pain and trauma inflicted by the act, the girl broke down in front of her grandmother and told her what happened. The senior citizen called the girl's mother and told her to rush home.



A complaint was lodged in Ramol police station the next day and the father was arrested. "We have arrested the accused under Rape and POCSO Act. Further investigation is underway," said Inspector KS Dave.



The man is employed by a private company as a driver. Primary investigation has revealed that this was his first known sexual offence.



"We suspect that the dispute with his wife might have triggered the man to rape his daughter in an act of revenge and anger," said the police. "Further investigation will reveal more information about the case and what actually has happened.
