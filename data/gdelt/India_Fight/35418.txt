Islamabad, Pakistan: After a lull of some weeks, Indian Army again resorted to unprovoked cease fire violation using rockets and mortars in Battal, Satwal, Khanjar, Nikyal and Jandrot Sectors along Line of Control (LOC).

The recent Indian aggression of targeting civilian population and Army posts resulted martyrdom of Havaldar Manzoor Abbasi.

According to a press statement issued by the Inter Service Public Relations (ISPR) of Pakistan Army, Army troops of Pakistan effectively responded to Indian firing and targeted those posts which initiated fire. Indian Post heavily damaged causing casualties.

During exchange of fire Havaldar Manzoor Abbasi embraced Shahadat while 4 citizens including two young girls and a women got injured.

Pakistan and India were engaged in Track II Diplomacy this week and also held a meeting on July 14 to finalise Kartarpur Corridor. There was lull at Indo-Pak Line of Control and working boundaries but today Indian unprovoked violation of cease fire indicates that India is still not serious for normalization of bilateral relations although Pakistan tried its best to neutralize situation at borders and even handed over Indian pilot who was arrested after his Mig21 was short down by Pakistan Air Force on February 27, 2019.

It is worth mentioning that Pakistani Prime Minister is in Washington DC for his meeting with US President Trump and Indo-Pak border situation may be a part of their talks.
