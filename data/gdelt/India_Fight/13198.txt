War looming over India and Pakistan because of Kashmir: UJC

Srinagar: Conglomerate of militant outfits United Jihad Council Tuesday said the war is looming over India and Pakistan because of Kashmir.

The UJC said that war like situation is there not because of so-called terrorism. “India is harping on terrorism to divert the attention from the Kashmir issue while Pakistan needs to concentrate wholeheartedly on the resolution of Kashmir,” Syed Sadaqat Hussain, the UJC spokesperson quoted Hizb Chief Syed Salahuddin as having said.

Salahuddin said the continuous offer for talks from Pakistan has turned Modi led government more insolent and it has been demoralizing the freedom loving people from Kashmir. “Peace can’t prevail between India and Pakistan when Kashmir is burning. The criminal silence from International community is forcing freedom loving people from Kashmir to turn into ‘Fidayeena,’ he said.

He said when people of Kashmir confront Indian forces and raise their voices against atrocities, they are being labeled as terrorists.

Salahuddin asked OIC to shun its double standard and help people of Kashmir by isolating India. “OIC needs to break diplomatic ties with India,” he said.

While expressing anguish over the deteriorating condition of political prisoners, Salahuddin appealed international human rights organizations to stop India from playing with these prisoners.

He described the ban on Jamat-e-Islami as an attempt to deprive new generation from seeking religious and moral education.Salahuddin blamed RSS for the JeI ban and asked people to rasie their voices.

Syed Salahuddin paid rich tribute to militants Irfan Ahmed Rather, Adfar Fayaz, Ishfaq Ahmed and Wasim Ahmed Mir, who were killed in recent gunfights in Kashmir. He reiterated that the sacrifices rendered by people will not go waste. (CNS)
