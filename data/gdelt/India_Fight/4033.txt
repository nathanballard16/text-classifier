According to initial reports, the two pilots of the trainer version of the Mirage 2000 managed to eject after the aircraft developed a technical snag. The pilots have been identified as Squadron Leader Negi and Squadron Leader Abrol. The aircraft was flying a test sortie.

The Indian Air Force's Mirage 2000 fleet is being upgraded by HAL in Bengaluru with new electronics and weaponry. The Indian Air Force's fleet of about 50 Mirage 2000 fighters has been one of its most reliable platforms as a multirole fighter, having seen combat in the Kargil War.
