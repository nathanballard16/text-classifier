Mamata won’t attend Modi’s swearing-in ceremony tomorrow

NEW DELHI, May 29, 2019 (BSS) – In a sudden move, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today decided not to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi tomorrow.

Her decision came after the family members of BJP workers allegedly killed in political violence in West Bengal were invited for the ceremony.

On Tuesday, Mamata had told reporters in Kolkata that she would attend Modi’s swearing in ceremony since it is a “constitutional courtesy”.

The chief minister in a message posted in her Tweeter described the BJP’s allegation that 54 of its workers were killed in political violence in the state as “completely untrue”.

“The swearing-in ceremony is an august occasion to celebrate democracy, not one that should be devalued by any political party that uses it as an opportunity to score political points,” she wrote.

Congratulating Narendra Modi, she said it was her plan to accept the ‘constitutional invitation’ and attend the oath-taking ceremony.

“However, in the last one hour, I am seeing media reports that the BJP are claiming 54 people have been murdered in political violence in Bengal. This is completely untrue,” she said.

The Trinamool Congress leader claimed that there have been no political murders in Bengal. The deaths may have taken place due to personal enmity, family quarrels and other disputes, nothing related to politics.

“So, I am sorry, Narendra Modi Ji, this has compelled me not to attend the ceremony,” she wrote in her message.
