Minister Jayakumar slams actor Vijay for posing with a weapon

Minister says that the 'Bigil' poster will induce youth to follow suit

Taking a dig at actor Vijay for posing with a dagger in his latest film Bigil, senior AIADMK leader and Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said on Tuesday that it would only induce youth to follow suit. Instead, actors should emulate the AIADMK founder and late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran by spreading good morals through their films.

During an interaction with reporters here, Mr. Jayakumar said actors were seen with cigarettes and daggers: “I saw Bigil [poster] and he has a dagger in his hand… What will the young generation do? Won’t they think that their ‘leader’ has a dagger and I will follow suit? Like leader, like follower.”

When a reporter pointed out that MGR too was seen with a dagger in some films, he said it mattered what type of dagger was used. “It [MGR seen with dagger] was for romance,” he said.

Launching an attack on actors who were driven by profit motive, Mr. Jayakumar said money should not be the motive while making films. On the Higher Education Department issuing a notice to a private college in Chennai for allowing its campus to be used for the audio launch function of Bigil, the Minister said he would prefer to wait for the college’s response.

“College is for studies and not for conducting shootings,” he said.
