Two soldiers among four dead in gunfire at border

(MENAFN- Gulf Times) At least four people, including two soldiers, were killed after heavy exchanges of gunfire along the border in the Kashmir region, the Pakistani army said yesterday.

Two Pakistani soldiers died after being fired upon by Indian troops in Kashmir, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), military's media wing, said.

The statement said that Indian troops fired along the Line of Control (LoC), a de facto border that divides the disputed Kashmir region into two parts, one administered by India and the other by Pakistan.

'India deliberately targeted civil population, the ISPR said.

Multiple ceasefire violations have been reported in the border region after tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours escalated this week, stoking fears of a full-blown conflict.

In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the army said heavy Indian firing killed two civilians in Tatta Pani and Jandrot sectors. Another two people were wounded.

The border clashes came hours after Pakistani authorities released an Indian pilot as a peace gesture to help calm tensions.

The pilot was shot down on Wednesday during air combat between air forces of the countries and later captured.

A day earlier, India's air force claimed to have struck an alleged training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed militant group in Pakistan, in retaliation for a suicide attack that killed 40 paramilitary soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir on February 14.
