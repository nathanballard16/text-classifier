Delhi Congress worker shot at by bike-borne assailants

GREATER NOIDA: A Congress worker who is serving as a member of the party’s publicity committee in Delhi and the vice president of the Delhi Capital Badminton Association ( DCBA ) was allegedly shot at by one of the two assailants who arrived on a bike outside Greater Noida ’s Omaxe Palm Greens society in MU sector where she had gone with her daughter to see a flat on Monday. Poonam Sehgal (48) had returned from Vrindavan and was visiting the society on her way back in her white Volkswagen Vento (DL8CL8756) along with her daughter Mallika who was seated on the seat next to the driver’s seat.Around 5 pm, when Sehgal started the car and had travelled a few meters, two assailants – both wearing helmets- arrived on a black bike and slowed down the vehicle near the driver’s side.“I was shocked to see them, the car was still in the driving mode when one of them suddenly got down and shot at the window of the driver’s seat. The bullet pierced through the window and got embedded in the panel of the window of the seat where my daughter was seated. I was appalled and simply left the steering wheel when the attack happened within seconds,” she said.Sehgal alleged that the accused allegedly tried to repeatedly press the trigger of the country-made pistol that he was holding but it could not fire.A resident of Pitampura area in Delhi, Poonam said that she could later hear the accused saying words like: “Kill both of them”.There were pieces of glass strewn in the car all over and many of them fell on their clothes, she said adding that luckily they were not seriously hurt.She said that the assailants later fled the spot in a jiffy.According to Sehgal, she called up 100 number within three-four minutes and the police arrived within 20 minutes.“They looked at the car and said that it was possible that it was a mistake but later themselves spotted the bullet shot in the panel of the window on the left side. We kept sitting at the police station for about five hours but a forensic examination of the car was not carried out,” she alleged.A month ago on April 13, Sehgal was allegedly attacked by a middle-aged man in Delhi’s Uttam Nagar area while she was purchasing groceries too. An FIR has been lodged in that police station against the accused who was arrested by police.When contacted, Surajpur SHO Munish Chauhan told TOI that an FIR has been lodged under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 427 (mischief causing damage) based on the complaint of Sehgal.Denying delay in conducting the forensic examination, he said that they will soon get the forensic examination of the car done by a team which will take out the bullet from the window panel.“It has come to light that the woman has lodged a complaint in Uttar Nagar police station too. We are investigating the matter,” he said.Meanwhile, with the forensic examination pending, the car continues to be lodged at the Surajpur police station premises.
