One terrorist was killed by security forces in an encounter in Kulgam district of Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, while a Deputy Superintendent of Police lost his life while fighting the militants. The DSP has been identified as Aman Thakur.

Security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation in the Turigam area of Kulgam district following information about presence of some militants there, a police official said. He said the militants opened fire on security forces, who retaliated, triggering a gun-battle.

Earlier on Friday, two terrorists belonging to Pak-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, were gunned down by security forces in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district.

It was on February 14 when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district, killing at least 40 personnel and leaving many critically wounded. The carnage triggered anger in the country, with India taking major decisions against Pakistan to build diplomatic and international pressure on the neighbouring country.
