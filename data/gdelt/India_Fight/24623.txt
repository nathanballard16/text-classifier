Salman Khan never fails to surprise his fans and he might do just that yet again. The most eligible bachelor of Bollywood, who is asked often about his wedding plans, it seems is all set to welcome a new member in his family. If a source is to be believed, it is not going to be a life partner, but a baby. Yes, you read that right!

A source told ETimes that the actor is apparently going to opt for surrogacy. While rumours surrounding his love life are common now, this is the first time something about him planning to become a father has popped up.

It is a renowned fact that Salman loves kids and in the past, he has gone on record to say that if he ever decides to get married, it will be for the kids only and since he has no plans to get married now can there be any truth in these reports?

If Salman actually opts for surrogacy then he will join the likes of Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Johar, Aamir Khan, Ekta Kapoor and other Bollywood celebs. The actor’s love for children is a known fact and he is often seen spending quality time with his nephews and nieces and we are totally waiting for him to announce the news if it is true at all.

On the work front, Salman will next be seen in Bharat which will feature Katrina Kaif alongside him. The Ali Abbas Zafar directorial is slated for an Eid release. The actor has started shooting for the third instalment in the Dabangg franchise which is going to hit the theatres on December 20.
