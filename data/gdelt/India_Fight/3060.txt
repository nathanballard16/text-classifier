Two arrested for former Gujarat MLA’s murder

The Gujarat Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID-Crime) on Thursday arrested two persons in connection with the murder of former legislator Jayanti Bhanushali, who was killed in a moving train by unidentified assailants on January 7, 2019.

According to the police, Mr. Bhanushali was shot dead by Pune-based sharpshooters, who were given a contract to kill by another former legislator and BJP leader Chhabil Patel, who hatched a conspiracy with one Manisha Goswami, a former aide of Bhanushali.

“Chhabil Patel and Manisha Goswami hatched a conspiracy to get Mr. Bhanushali killed because personal and professional rivalry,” said ADGP Ajay Tomar.

He said a special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe this high profile murder has arrested two persons — Nitin Patel and Rahul Patel — in connection with the crime.

“We have also identified sharpshooters: Shashikant alias Dada Kamble, who faces several cases in Yarwada in Maharashtra, and Sheikh Ashraf Anwar, who also faces several cases” Mr. Tomar said, adding that both sharpshooters are currently on the run.

Manisha Goswami is also evading arrest, while Mr. Chhabil Patel had already left India on January 3, a few days before the murder.

“We have formed several teams to nab the culprits,” Mr. Tomar said, when asked about the arrests of the remaining accused.

“So far, our probe has revealed that the murder was a result of personal enmity between Chhabil Patel and Bhanushali. Chhabil Patel and Manisha (Goswami) ganged up against him,” he added.

Bhanushali was accused of rape by a Surat-based woman, who subsequently withdrew her complaint. There were also allegations of Bhanushali and sGoswami running a sex racket in Kutch, Gujarat.
