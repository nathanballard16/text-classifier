Manmohan Singh Blames P V Narasimha Rao For 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots; Accused Of Trying To Shield The Gandhis

Following his statement, many social media users accused Singh of trying to shield Rajiv Gandhi who has been accused of having a role in the riots.

Many also questioned as to why did he agree to become a Finance Minister in the P V Narasimha Rao government if the latter was responsible for failing to stop the riots.

According to official records, about 2,800 Sikhs were killed across India, including 2,100 in Delhi, during the violence that broke out after former PM Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her bodyguards.

Gujral, the 12th Prime Minister of India between April 1997 and March 1998, propounded the 'Gujral Doctrine' of five principles for maintaining good relations with India's neighbours.

Former President Dr Pranab Mukherjee was also present at the event who was reported saying that he regretted the then Congress high command's decision to withdraw support from IK Gujral-led United Front government in 1998. He added that the decision allowed BJP to come to power.
