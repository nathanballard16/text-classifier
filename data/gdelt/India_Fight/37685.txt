Article 370 scrapped, Jammu Kashmir no more a State

With the commencement of the Parliament session, Union Home Minister Amit Shah moved a resolution to remove Article 370 in the state of Jammu and Kashmir that confers special status to it.

The move comes after a massive security build-up and house arresting the three most prominent politicians from Jammu and Kashmir – Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and Sajad Lone. Phone lines and Internet services in the State have been forced out of service along with the imposition of Section 144, banning large gatherings and public meetings as part of precautionary measures.

Mr. Shah further moved a bill in the Upper House of the Parliament regarding the bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories – Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. The proposal suggests for having no legislature in Ladakh while the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir will have a legislature like Delhi and Puducherry.
