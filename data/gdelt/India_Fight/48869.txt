Delhi: Suspects in murder of financier, aide held in Patna

NEW DELHI: Two men involved in the sensational double murder of a financier and his associate were caught hiding in a friend’s house in Patna, Bihar. A probe revealed that they had called the financier and his associate for a party at their house and spiked their drink with sleeping pills. When they passed out, the men took the duo to Munak canal, shot them and dumped their bodies in the canal. A monetary dispute triggered the crime.Deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Joy Tirkey said that after the recovery of the bodies, a team was formed to track down the two men. “We found Naveen Vashisth and Rajneesh Bantoo hiding in a friend’s house in Patna. A team was sent and the men were caught near the Meethapur bus stop when they were boarding a bus to flee to Nepal,” said Tirkey.During interrogation, Vashisth claimed that a few years ago he got into the property dealing business, but failed to earn profits. About a year ago, he started a factory of disposable items, but this business also started tanking. He then took a loan of Rs 3 lakh from the financier Amit Hooda. When he was unable to repay, Hooda started pressurising Vashisth to return the money. He even abused him publicly. Vashisth then hatched a plan to eliminate Amit Hooda. He recruited his friends Bantoo and Vikas in his plan.Rajnish, who has a past criminal record, already had a couple of pistols. As per the plan, they hosted a liquor party at Vashisth’s flat in Rohini’s Sector 24 and invited Hooda offering to pay him the money. When Hooda arrived with his employee Nikhil Gulati, they had liquor and food together. During this, Vashisth put an entire strip of sleeping pills in the liquor glasses of the victims. When they passed out, the accused stuffed Hooda and Nikhil into the boot of their car and then shot them near a canal.Police said that Vashisth was also earlier involved in cases of murder and robbery in Bihar. Efforts are on to nab Vikas.
