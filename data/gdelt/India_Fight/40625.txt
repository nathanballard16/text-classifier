'Enough! You're not supposed to do that': Saif Ali Khan requests paps to not click Taimur Ali Khan outside their house

After almost two months, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan along with their son Taimur Ali Khan returned to Mumbai. The whole family was in London where Saif was shooting for his forthcoming film, Jawaani Jaaneman. On the other hand, Kareena shot for Angrezi Medium and she also made her weekly visits to Mumbai for Dance India Dance. But overall it was Taimur's return which was the most-awaited by the paparazzi.

The cute star kid is the paparazzi's favourite child (literally) and clicking him after a long time became a field day for them. However, Saif doesn't seem to be that keen to get his son clicked anymore by the paps. Last evening while taking a stroll near their home, Saif and Taimur were snapped by the photogs. But Saif then went near the photographers and told them, "No, no not outside the house please, like we promised. No, enough, you are not supposed to do that."

Interestingly, while Saif was walking, Taimur was sitting on his shoulders and also waving at the shutterbugs.

Earlier, Saif had asked the paparazzi to take it easy and when Kareena was asked about it, she said, "It's a very confusing thing. I don't want him to get used to the fact that he is getting clicked but now he understands. He hears us say, 'the media is there,' so he is picking up words. They have been very kind, they remain at a distance but it's a constant movement."
