Director general (South Asia and SAARC) Mohammad Faisal, who is also the foreign ministry spokesperson, summoned Ahluwalia and “condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by the Indian forces on 15th August in Lipa and Battal Sectors”, the Foreign Office said in a statement.

Faisal claimed the Indian forces along the LoC and working boundary have “continuously been violating the 2003 ceasefire arrangement, which needs to be respected”. “The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation,” he said.
