Delhi: Rohini Doctor Shoots Female Friend Dead With Licensed Pistol, Commits Suicide In Car

New Delhi:

A 62-year-old doctor allegedly murdered his female friend before committing suicide inside a parked car in Delhi’s Rohini area on Wednesday. Initial probe reveals that the incident came to light around 7:30 am in morning when the onlookers noticed the bodies inside a white sedan and informed the police. The doctor has been identified as Omprakash Kukreja. He used to work at a nursing home owned by one Sudipta Mukherjee. Cops say early probe showed that Kukreja was involved in a romantic relationship with the 55-year-old nursing home owner. The police say that prima facie it looks like Kukreja first killed the woman with his licensed pistol and later shot himself dead. Sources say that Mukherjee was putting pressure on already-married Kukreja to leave his handicap wife and marry her.
