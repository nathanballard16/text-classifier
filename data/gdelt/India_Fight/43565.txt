‘Himalayas occupy centrality in geopolitics of India’

India Foundation director says India’s borders have become ‘Tibetified’

The Himalayas occupy a central position in the geopolitics of ‘Bharat’ and while they have impeded large armies from entering India, the mountain range has allowed a transfer of ideas and cultures, said India Foundation director, Alok Bansal.

Mr. Bansal was speaking at a seminar on ‘Geopolitics of Himalayan Region’ on Saturday where he said that Dalai Lama is ‘ageing’ and observed that that the borders of India have become ‘Tibetified’. “The population in Leh, Tawang Kinnaur, a vast majority of this population owes its allegiance to His Holiness Dalai Lama. What happens after he passes away? A new Dalai Lama may emerge in China. The largest monastery in Leh is Hemis Monastery; its abbot lives in Chengdu in China,” he said.

Describing the issue as ‘complex’, Mr. Bansal pointed out that the Dalai Lama has said Tibet is a part of China and that the ‘fight’ is only for its autonomy.

“We are putting all our eggs in one basket. What happens if things go wrong,” he questioned.

“His Holiness lives in McLeod Ganj and he makes statements which are pro-India. But suppose he goes to China tomorrow, then what? Or worse, he passes away and the new Dalai Lama takes birth in China, because it is a question of reincarnation. Who decides? It is left to you. Once they position somebody, that is all. The population will go there,” he said.

Comparing China and Pakistan, Mr. Bansal said there is no ideological clash with the former while there is one with the latter.

He expressed confidence that eventually India will take control of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. China, he said, is not a threat, but a challenge.

Prof. Bansal urged the audience to try to understand Gilgit-Baltistan and other areas such as Aksai Chin region.
