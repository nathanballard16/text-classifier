Besides the low fares, the airline is also offering cashback of up to Rs 500 for flyers who make online payments using the MobiKwik wallet.

However, this offer can be only availed once per user. It can be taken on non-stop flights only, which means flyers who wish to book tickets for connecting flights cannot avail benefits of the sale offered by the airline.

The sale is also not applicable on IndiGo’s group bookings, according to the company.

The sale has been clashing with Jet Airways and AirAsia, which are also offering low fares on domestic as well as international flights from India.

Jet Airways, under its ‘Global Sale’ running from January 5 to January 11, is offering up to 50 percent discount on domestic and international flight bookings with certain conditions.

The AirAsia's sale began on January 7 and is offering flight tickets as low as Rs 999 with applicable conditions. The sale will be continued till January 20, during which flyers can book ticket to travel between January 21 and July 31.
