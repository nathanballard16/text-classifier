Opinion : How India and Pakistan can step back from the brink of war

Delay the war, it is better

Your yard or mine,

If the lights stay on, it is better





The blood be your own or foreign

It is the blood of Adam, after all

The war, it may be in the west or east

It is the murder of world peace, after all.
