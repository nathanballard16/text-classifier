Regional language newspapers put in their own two cents:

On Saturday, citizens woke up to find the headlines of their national and regional language newspapers out of date with most publications going in the direction of "Uddhav to be next CM of Maharashtra".

President's Rule in the state was revoked early on Saturday morning, with the BJP staking claim to form the government, propped up by NCP's Ajit Pawar, who was sworn in as the deputy chief minister to Devendra Fadnavis, who returned as chief minister for the second consecutive term.

Amid a hasty meeting of the NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress, it remained unclear as to how many NCP MLAs were backing Fadnavis-Pawar government. Late Saturday night, the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress combine approached the Supreme Court seeking a quashing of the governor's decision to swear in Fadnavis as the chief minister.

Supreme Court on Sunday asked the Centre to place before it on Monday morning the letters of Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari inviting Devendra Fadnavis and of the BJP leader staking his claim to form the government in the state.

In an unprecedented hearing on a Sunday, the apex court, however, did not grant any interim relief to the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress combine to direct the Fadnavis government to undertake floor test within 24 hours and rather said that this issue would be dealt with only after perusing the two letters on Monday.
