So, Kareena, whose airport fashion is mostly laid back, gave us another relaxed number. Moreover, the diva also inspired us again to sport flared conventional denims to the airport. So, yes, she wore a pair of high-waist denims and teamed it with blue, red, and white striped tee on both the occasions. However, she changed her jacket.
