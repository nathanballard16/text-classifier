Patna, January 11

A 45-year-old man of Gaya district of Bihar was on Friday arrested for killing his minor daughter after her beheaded body was recovered.

The man in connivance with his friend had killed his 16-year-old daughter, who had eloped with her friend on December 28, but returned to her parents after three days.

The man confessed to the police that he had killed his daughter.

He had also lodged the missing complaint about her daughter on January 4.

The beheaded body of the girl was found in the fields after which a protest march was held in Gaya demanding the arrest of the killers.

Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said: “The police arrested her father and his friend as they had committed the cold-blooded murder. It is case of honour killing.”

Mishra said, “Prima facie, it appeared that she was abducted and raped before being killed. Later, the postmortem report revealed that she was not raped. Her younger sister also said that she had been last seen with their father’s friend that helped in unravelling the mystery.”
