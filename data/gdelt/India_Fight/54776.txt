VARANASI: A mustard oil trader was shot at in a loot bid by three armed miscreants in Machhodari area under the limits of Kotwali police station on Monday morning.

SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary along with city SP and other senior officials took stock of the incident site and said that the incident took place for robbery of cash from Om Prakash Jaiswal (50). The family of Jaiswal had lodged an FIR against the three unidentified miscreants. He said that the police teams have been engaged to nab the looters at earliest.

Jaiswal, a native of Katuapura locality, had left home with cash over Rs 50,000 to clear dues of the oil mill operators. When he was passing through garbage dumping site of Machhodari area, three armed miscreants intercepted him and tried to snatch his bag containing the cash.

When Jaiswal opposed their bid the miscreants opened fire at him and fled after looting the bag. Locals rushed Jaiswal to a private hospital where his condition was stable. Police are examining CCTV footages of nearby buildings to identify the looters.
