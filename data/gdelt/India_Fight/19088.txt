The blaze in CGO complex had started on the fifth floor of the Pandit Deendayal Antyodaya Bhawan. It is to be noted that Antyodaya Bhawan in the CGO complex houses many important government offices, including a branch of the Indian Air Force, Water and Sanitation Ministry, Forest Ministry and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

Just a month before the incident at CGO, a major fire broke out at a hotel in New Delhi's Karol Bagh that resulted in the death of 17 people.
