Ducati eyes expansion in Tier Two Cities across India

Currently, Ducati has nine dealerships across India.

As part of its expansion plan, Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati is planning to expand to Tier-2 cities across India. The company’s move to tap into Tier-2 cities is aimed towards having a bigger presence in the country.

Currently, Ducati has nine dealerships across India. The brand is present in Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kochi, Kolkata and Chennai.

Sergio Canovas, Managing Director, Ducati India, said, “The expansion into Tier-2 cities is crucial because India is an important market for the brand.”

The Italian manufacturer provides 27 models across several motorcycle styles in the country. Ducati has no plans of investing in a production or assembly line in India at the moment.

“An investment in an assembly line within the country depends on what is best for the markets in terms of cost, quality, and supply. The current free trade agreement between India and Thailand works best for customers in India. However, if things change, if it requires to be here, there is no doubt that we will be here,” Canovas added.
