International court to hear Kerala fishermen death case against Italian marines in July

The Italian contention is that the the two marines were in international waters and acted to protect an Italian oil tanker as part of an anti-piracy mission.

The final hearing in the Kerala fishermen death case against Italian marines will be held at the international court in The Hague in July. The hearing will be held at he Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at the Peace Palace between July 8-20.

The hearing relates to the arbitration in the Enrica Lexie incident (Italy vs India) which dates back to 2012 where the two Italian marines Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre are accused of shooting two Indian fishermen off India's southern Kerala coast.



The PCA in The Hague will hold a public hearing on who has jurisdiction in the case. "The forthcoming hearing will address the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal as well as the merits of Italy's claims and India's counter-claims," the court said in a statement.

The Italian contention is that they were in international waters and acted to protect an Italian oil tanker as part of an anti-piracy mission.

The arbitral proceedings were instituted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ("UNCLOS") on 26 June 2015, when Italy served on India a "Notification under Article 287 and Annex VII, Article 1 of UNCLOS and Statement of Claim and Grounds on Which it is Based".

Italy approached the international court of arbitration on where the two men should be tried since it wants the case transferred to Rome.

Currently, the two marines are in Italy pending a decision from the PCA. After having been detained in India for two and four years, respectively, the two marines were finally released and returned to Italy.
