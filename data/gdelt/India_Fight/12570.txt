Amit Shah is calling the armed forces liars: CM

Kejriwal reacts to BJP chief’s statement on Balakot air strike

Accusing the BJP of lying, Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said BJP president Amit Shah’s statement that 250 terrorists were killed in the Balakot air strike was in contradiction with the Air Force’s stand that they don’t count human casualties.

In a series of tweets in Hindi, Mr. Kejriwal reacted to the news of Mr. Shah saying that 250 terrorists were killed in the air strike.

“After the Pulwama attack, everyone was thinking that we can’t do surgical strike so what will happen... But Narendra Modi government, on the 13th day [after the attack], conducted air strikes and killed more than 250 terrorists,” Mr. Shah had said at an event in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa, however, said at a press conference in Coimbatore on Monday morning that the Air Force does not count human casualties.

Mr. Kejriwal asked whether Mr. Shah meant that the armed forces were lying.

He said the Air Force had clearly said that it could not say if and how many people were killed in the strike.

‘BJP is lying’

“For their electoral gain, are Amit Shah and BJP calling the forces liars? The country has faith in the armed forces. Don’t Amit Shah and the BJP have faith in the forces? [sic]” Mr. Kejriwal asked in a tweet.

In another tweet, he said the armed forces cannot lie, but the “BJP is lying”.

He also accused the BJP of being “against” the armed forces, while the country was with the forces.

Referring to the news of Union Minister S.S. Ahluwalia saying that the aim of the strike was to send a message, not to kill, Mr. Kejriwal said by saying 250 people were killed, Mr. Shah was terming the forces’ liars. He added the country would not “tolerate this at any cost”. (With PTI inputs)
