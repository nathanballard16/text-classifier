Bengaluru: The Central Crime Branch (CCB), on Thursday, arrested an eight-member honey trapping gang that has been blackmailing politicians and businessmen in Bengaluru. The gang has been active for three years but came under the radar of the police after an MLA from North Karnataka approached the cops. Sex tape of the MLA has been leaked. The police have, however, not revealed the identities of the accused and are on the lookout for the kingpin in the case.

The racket was exposed after the police carried out raids at hideouts of the gang members following tip-offs. According to a Deccan Chronicle report, two of the eight people are women. The gang has been trying to extort crores of rupees from politicians and businessmen.

According to the report, the Modus Operandi of the gang involved sending a woman operative to the politician. She would narrate her ordeal to the politicians and establish a close relationship with them. Later, she would record intimate videos with the victims with the help of her male gang members and later blackmail them to extort money.

In some of the cases, the women would accompany politicians on trips and lead them to hotel rooms where their movements would be captured in pre-installed cameras.

The matter came to light when one of the gang members demanded Rs 25 crore from a politician who complained to the CCB. The racket was busted on November 26 after the police laid a trap and arrested the man who has been taken in 10-day custody for further investigation.
