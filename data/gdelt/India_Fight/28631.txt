Police Rescue Patna Boy Abducted Four Days Ago

Patna: Four days after he was reported abducted from under Didarganj police station, police in Patna on late Monday night recovered 13-year old Rajat Kumar from a Bhagalpur village while arresting four men in the case.

As reported, Rajat, a Class VIII student in Patna City and son of private tutor Ranjit Kumar, was sent out to a chicken shop close to his home last Friday. He was then seen picked up by someone on a motorcycle. When he failed to return home that night, his parents filed a report of missing person with the Didarganj police station but the police did not take the matter seriously.

However, the family received a phone call during which the caller demanded a ransom of Rs. 60 lakh for the safe return of the boy.

Police then formed a special unit to investigate and recovered the boy and began carrying out raids at his friends, neighbors, and other acquaintances in both Patna and Vaishali district.

Based on the account of one Roshan Kumar of Raghopur in Vaishali district who was earlier arrested by the police, authorities raided a home in Naugachhia in Bhagalpur where police arrested three other men and rescued the victim from their clutches.

Besides Roshan, the arrested men were identified as Amarnath Sharma, his brother Jaiprakash Sharma, Kailash Chaurasia. Police also recovered five cellphones, a country-made pistol, live cartridges, and two motorbikes.
