RAJKOT: Ten persons were injured following clash between two families in Dhararnagar locality of Lalpur in Jamnagar district on Tuesday.

Police said while one of the warring families is supporter of BJP, the other is supporter of Congress.

While from one family, a woman is an elected member of Lalpur taluka panchayat from the BJP, from the other family another woman is the member of the same panchayat from the Congress party.

On Monday evening, there was a demolition drive going on near the house of Nathi Chawda, the BJP member of the panchayat. Chawda’s husband, Jitesh Chawda, raised an objection, triggering altercation between Chawda and the family members of Chandrika Vania, the Congress member of the panchayat.

Chandrika’s husband Anil Vania filed a complaint against the Chawda and his family members, accusing them of hurling abuses near his house. This sowed the seeds of enmity between the two families.

“Harbouring a grudge against each other, the members of both the families confronted each other armed with swords, bats and iron pipes on Tuesday. We have booked 20 persons from both the groups,” said B S Vala, inspector with Lalpur police station.

Those injured in the clash from the Chawda’s family include her father-in-law Chana Chawda, husband Jitesh, sister-in-law Madhu Chawda, her nephews — Nirmal Chawda and Yogesh Chawda.

Chana’s condition was critical as he received severe head injuries and has been admitted to a private hospital in Rajkot.

Those injured from Vania family include Anil Vania, Girdhar Vania, Mahesh Vania, Rakesh Vania and Raju Vania.
