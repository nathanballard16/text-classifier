LUDHIANA: A day after a woman was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her place in Khanna Khurd road, police have arrested and booked her husband Gurmeet Singh for murder. The relatives of the deceased, Kirandeep Kaur, said she was married to Gurmeet three years ago. On Saturday, they came to know about her death, and reached her place.

Police officials said her family members claimed that on seeing her body, they came to know she had died of strangulation. They added that Kirandeep’s in-laws claimed she had committed suicide, but her family maintained she was murdered. Cops said they had taken her body into possession and shifted it to the Khanna civil hospital for a post-mortem examination, which will be done on Monday.

SHO of Khanna City 2 police station, sub-inspector Devinder Singh, said the couple had some problems between them, as Kirandeep could not bear a child, for which Gurmeet held her responsible.
