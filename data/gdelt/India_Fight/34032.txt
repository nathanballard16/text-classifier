Ananya Panday or Sara Ali Khan: Who looks better with Kartik Aaryan?

Ananya Panday, who entered Bollywood with Karan Johar’s film Student of the Year 2, is now all set to entertain her fans with her next film with Kartik Aaryan titled Pati Patni Aur Woh. The two have finally started shooting for the film in UP. But even before the film was announced, Kartik and Ananya had become the talk of the town. Now when Ananya was asked who she thought looked better with Kartik – she herself or his Aaj Kal co-star, Sara Ali Khan, the SOTY 2 actress had a very witty reply.

Talking to a news portal, she said, “No ya, I think he looks good with everyone. He is such a good looking guy. So yeah, it’s cute. (But) who’s voting for who? I’m not checking.” She even revealed how Kartik Aaryan makes her laugh all the time and it only proves that the two actors are having a fun time shooting for the film.

She said, “We shot three days in February, that was one short schedule that we did. But I’m going to Lucknow and I’m going for two months so, I’m super excited. I shot with him, I didn’t get a chance to shoot with Bhumi yet. But he is such a good actor, his command over the language is amazing so he improvises really well. And such a selfless actor, he thinks about how to make the scene better rather than just his own lines. Also, he is just fun to be around, just makes me laugh all the time.”

Helmed by Mudassar Aziz, Ananya’s Pati Patni Aur Woh is a remake of 1978 Sanjeev Kumar classic of the same name. Slated for a December 6, 2019 release, the film also stars Bhumi Pednekar. Stay tuned to CineBlitz for more updates and news.
