Truth always prevails, PM Imran on report rejecting Indian claim of downing F-16

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said Indian ruling party's attempt to wing election through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pakistan's F-16 aircraft has backfired.

The remarks came a day after Foreign Police magazine while citing US defence officials said Indian claims of shooting down Pakistani aircraft were incorrect.

"The truth always prevails and is always the best policy," the prime minister wrote and added that Bharatiya Janata Party, India's ruling party, attempt to win elections through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pak F 16 has backfired with US Defence officials also confirming that no F16 was missing from Pakistan's fleet.



The Foreign Police magazine reported that US officials counted Pakistani F-16 and found non-missing, in a severe setback to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi just ahead of elections in which he seeks second term in office.
