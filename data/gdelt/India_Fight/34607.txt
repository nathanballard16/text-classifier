Sri Lanka President claims drug gangs orchestrated Easter blasts

COLOMBO: International drug syndicates orchestrated Sri Lanka ’s deadly Easter Sunday bombings, the country’s leader claimed on Monday, despite earlier blaming the attacks on Islamic extremists. The statement comes amid a nationwide narcotics crackdown, with President Maithripala Sirisena aiming to re-introduce capital punishment for drug offences.Authorities have said local jihadi group National Tawheed Jamaat (NTJ) were responsible for the suicide bombings in churches and hotels that killed at least 258 people in April. The attacks were later claimed by Islamic State.Sirisena’s office said the day after the bombings that local terrorists and international terror groups were responsible for the attacks. But in a statement issued by his office on Monday, Sirisena said the attacks “were the work of international drug dealers”. “Drug barons carried out this attack to discredit me and discourage my anti-narcotics drive. I will not be deterred,” he said.Sirisena is waging a battle against efforts by his governing coalition in parliament to abolish capital punishment, which has been subject to a moratorium since 1976.A spokesman for PM Ranil Wickremesinghe discounted the president’s claims. “Police completed the investigations within about two weeks,” Sudarshana Gunawardana said. “There is no mention of drug dealers being involved. We have no reason to doubt our investigators.”
