Minority panel asks Delhi Police to be alert

In view of the deteriorating communal situation in various parts of the country

In the aftermath of the terror attack in Pulwama on Thursday, the Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) on Saturday asked Delhi Police to be on high alert for those trying to vitiate the atmosphere in the Capital.

“In view of the deteriorating communal situation in various parts of the country, including Delhi, in the wake of the terrorist attack in Pulwama,” DMC chairperson Zafarul-Islam Khan had written to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik seeking directions to police stations to be alert, a DMC statement said.

Provocative slogans

“There are attacks on Kashmiris, even on ordinary Muslims, in various parts of the country in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Pulwama. Even in Delhi attempts are being made to vitiate the atmosphere and start riots,” the DMC chairperson wrote in his email to the commissioner.

He alleged that there were rallies raising “provocative slogans” being taken out in “Muslim areas and in front of Muslim homes in mixed population areas”.

“Unless Delhi Police is alert and proactive, riots will erupt like those in Jammu city for instance. Kindly, order all police stations in Delhi to be alert, proactive and responsive to the need to keep peace and amity at all costs,” the email stated.

Delhi Police, for its part, said it was on high alert following the attack that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama.

Ensure safety

“The city has been put on high alert. Security has been increased and officers have been deployed across the Capital, including in minority dominated areas; police visibility has been increased. We’ll ensure safety and security of every citizen,” said a Delhi police spokesperson.
