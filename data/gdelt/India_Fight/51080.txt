New Delhi, November 11

Thousands of JNU students clashed with the police, broke barricades and raised slogans against the V-C over hike

in hostel accommodation charges during a massive protest, leaving HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank stuck for over six hours.

Later, Nishank met representatives of the JNU Students Union and assured them of redressal of their grievances.

The protest, demanding immediate rollback of the measures “taken without consulting students’ body”, started when Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu was delivering the convocation address at the All India Council for Technical Education building.

Water cannons were used to disperse them and the police said some of them were detained.

The agitation mainly targeted a hostel manual that bars entry of unauthorised persons to hostel rooms beyond 10:30 pm. The JNUSU office-bearers said they were given a notice about a meeting on the manual barely 10 minutes before it was scheduled to be held. — TNS
