JAMMU, Jan 15: A BSF Assistant Commandant was killed on Tuesday morning in sniper fire from across the International Border in the Hiranagar sector of Kathua district in Jammu region.

According to BSF officials, Assistant Commandant Vinay Prasad was hit by a sniper shot at about 10:50 AM when he and his patrol party were out for “carrying out border domination” along the IB. “Pakistani snipers opened fire at them, leading to grievous injuries to the officer. Prasad was rushed to a medical facility in Satwari in Jammu where he later succumbed to his injuries,” said officials. The BSF director general and all ranks of the force salute the supreme sacrifice of the martyr. The BSF stands with the family of the bereaved, said a senior officer.

The Border Security Force (BSF) is tasked to guard the India-Pakistan International Border in the Jammu region of the state.

The Pakistani troops Tuesday violated ceasefire across several locations along the IB and Line of Control in Jammu. The reports of shelling came from Samba, Kathua, Poonch and Rajouri districts.

Earlier Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had warned Pakistan against its continued support to terror activities emanating from its soil.

Jammu and Kashmir recorded 2,936 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan in 2018—the highest in the past 15 years with an average of eight cases daily—in which 61 people were killed and over 250 injured.
