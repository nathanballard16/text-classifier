SRINAGAR, Nov 4: A tourist from Gujarat was injured in a stray incident of stone pelting at HMT on Srinagar today. Police has registered the case and investigations have been taken up.

According to a local news agency, KNO, a vehicle bearing number JK01 21A 3894, that was coming from Gulmarg to Srinagar with tourists from Gujarat and Mumbai on board was hit by a stray stone. “A tourist was hit by a stray stone that caused a minor injury,” a police official said.

He said there was no stone pelting in the area. “A single stone hit the tourist after which medical aid was given to him,” the police official said. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Srinagar, Dr Haseeb Mughal said that it was a very minor injury as there was no stone pelting or any clash in the area. An official identified the injured tourist as Nivesh Shah from Gujarat.

Police sources said investigations have started and a case has been registered. This is for the first time since New Delhi scrapped Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union Territories (UTs) on August 5, that a tourist vehicle was hit by stone.

Earlier on August 3, Centre had asked all the tourists including Amarnath Pilgrims to leave Kashmir immediately. However, on October 10, Centre revoked the advisory with an appeal to both domestic and foreign tourists to visit Kashmir again. However, due to the prevailing uncertainty, tourist influx to Kashmir continued to be low.
