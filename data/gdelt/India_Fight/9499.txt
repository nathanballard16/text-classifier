CCS committee meets after IAF strikes

New Delhi: The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) met here Tuesday morning at the residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out air strikes in Pakistan.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman were present at the meeting.

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and other top officials of the Prime Minister’s office and the security apparatus were also present, official sources said.

India is believed to have carried out air strikes inside Pakistan early Tuesday and targeted terror camps, sources said. ANI reported that the strikes by the Mirage 2000 have completely destroyed a JeM camp were terrorists were trained. The camp was situated in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

It must be stated here that this is the first time since the 1971 Indo-Park war the IAF has crossed the Line of Control (LoC). During the 1999 Kargil war even though the IAF was used to bomb terror outfits, the aircraft did not cross the LoC.

The extent of damage caused is still not known. However, a clear picture will emerge when the foreign secretary briefs the media in a short while from now.

Another source said that the IAF bases in Punjab and Haryana have been put on high alert. ANI further reported that the air bases in Jamnagar, Maliya, Ahmedabad Vadodara have also been put in battle ready position following the strikes.
