Mumbai police’s probe into the recent seizure of 1.02 kg of the banned narcotic, cocaine, allegedly from a Nigerian courier, has revealed a ‘web of deception’ employed by the international trafficking syndicate he worked for to evade detection by authorities.The Nigerian was even asked to enter India illegally. The accused had allegedly first travelled to Dhaka,, from Lagos,, and then paid US$ 100 (around Rs 6, 900) to a Bangladeshi middleman to help him enter India illegally by crossing the international land border, said sources.The 35-year-old accused, Bonaventure Nwude, was arrested with the contraband worth Rs 6.12 crore by’s Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC) last week. During interrogation, he allegedly revealed that he had initially attempted to mislead the probe by saying that he arrived in Dhaka on a “business visa”, a police source said.“Apart from being a courier for the narcotic trafficking syndicate, the accused runs a garment trade, which helped him procure a business visa for travel to Dhaka. In Dhaka, he got in touch with local middlemen specialising in facilitating illegal crossing of the Indo-Bangladesh border,” the source said.Acting on a tip-off, the ANC said its Bandra unit arrested Nwude with the cocaine in Khar west, where he had allegedly arrived from his rented flat in Koparkhairane to handover the stuff to distributors, the source said.“After entering India, the accused first went to Guwahati and then came to Mumbai. The probe is on to find out exactly from where he had entered the country illegally and the identities of his facilitators,” the source said. After verifying the information provided by the accused, help from the Bangladeshi authorities would be sought on his illegal crossover into India, he said.The accused had arrived in Mumbai with his wife and a kid, who returned to Nigeria soon after while he stayed on, the source said.Indicating the wide repertoire of tactics adopted by the trafficking syndicate to transport cocaine to Mumbai, where cocaine is sold at up to Rs 7,000 per gram in grey markets, the probe revealed that Nwude had earlier planned to enter India on a medical visa.The plan, however, was junked as the visa expired, said another police source.Nwude is allegedly a member of a syndicate that had twice earlier, in January and May this year, sent cocaine consignments, worth over Rs 9 crore to Mumbai, according to ANC’s Deputy Commissioner of Police Shivdeep Lande.In January, the ANC had seized 1.05 kg of cocaine worth Rs 6. 03 crore from two Nigerians and later, in May, seized another 510 gram of cocaine from a Kenyan national that was worth around Rs 3.06 crore.The police is also looking for a key wanted syndicate member, known by his alias of ‘Douglas’, who is suspected of being the point-person for cocaine sale in western India, sources said.
