Indian cinema veteran, Neena Gupta, who has weaved magic onscreen with her last two films – Mulk and Badhaai Ho, has come on board another interesting project. After handling a court drama in Anubhav Sinha's Mulk and tackling an unexpected pregnancy in Amit Sharma's Badhaai Ho, the actor is all set to manage cash crunch in her next.

Titled Gwalior, the film is written and directed by filmmaker-duo Rajeev Barnwal and Jaspal Singh Sandhu. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the film's cast including Sanjay Mishra is currently shooting in Gwalior, post which they will head to Varanasi for a 3-day schedule.

Gupta, who recently won the Filmfare Best Actress (Critics) award for her performance in Badhaai Ho, will play Manju Misha, a housewife. About her character, Gupta told the tabloid, “It is an interesting concept. I play Manju Mishra, a housewife, and the story narrates how an uneducated woman who is perceived as weak handles a situation involving cash crunch.”

Meanwhile, Mishra, who essays the role of her retired teacher husband, Sambhu Nath Mishra, revealed to the portal that his character is, in a way, his real-life father. In the same report, Mishra shared his excitement about collaborating with Gupta adding that he's grateful for the chance. He has been quoted as saying, “She is my senior from National School of Drama, and since I have the utmost respect for her in real life, it wasn’t difficult to forge the husband-wife bond on screen.”

Featuring Manav Vij and Sumit Gulati in key roles, the film revolves around the life of an old married couple and how it all changes with an unexpected turn, informed the film's director in an interaction with the tabloid.

The makers of Gwalior plan to wrap-up the shoot by next month, added the report.
