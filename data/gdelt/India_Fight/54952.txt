Dreaded Maoist Ramanna dies of heart attack in Chhattisgarh

RAIPUR: Dreaded and one of the most wanted Maoist cadres in the country, Ravula Srinivas alias Ramanna, 55, who carried a cash bounty of Rs 40 lakh on him, has died of a heart attack in the forests of Chhattisgarh. Ramanna was the secretary of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) and a member of the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), and was also the mastermind of some of the deadliest attacks on security forces in Bastar, Tadmetla, Jhiram, Burkapal and many other incidents.Bastar inspector general of police, P Sundarraj, told TOI that the death of Ramanna is "almost confirmed based on the inputs corroborated from the peripheries and the Maoists haven't denied the reports of his death yet either.''"Known for his authoritative management, Ramanna died a natural death at the age of 55 deep in the forests of restive Bijapur district of Bastar division ," Sundarraj said adding that though the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is yet to issue a statement of confirmation, it is expected to surface soon."For the last couple of days, the information of Ramanna suffering a heart attack has been taking rounds and though I still can't officially confirm as the body hasn't been recovered, the evidences and inputs corroborated the news. There was information that he was cremated in forests of Basaguda on Saturday night but police are yet to conclude Ramanna is dead," IG Sundarraj said.Only a direct source can authenticate it or a Maoist statement or a Maoist literature seized after operations from their camps. Despite the news taking rounds, Maoists otherwise quick to deny, haven't issued any statement of denial yet, he added. CPI(Maoist) releases usually take some time so that the senior cadre's death doesn't jolt the juniors and the content of release is made in a pattern that keeps the morale of other Maoists high.Born in Warangal district of Telangana , Ramanna played a key role in deadly attacks on security forces including the Jhiram attack on Congress convoy that killed 29 politicians and policemen in 2013, Tadmetla massacre that killed 76 CRPF men, 16 security personnel at Jhiram in 2014 and 25 CRPF personnel at Burkapal in 2017.Ramanna was a member of the central committee of the Maoists and was also secretary of DKSZC.
