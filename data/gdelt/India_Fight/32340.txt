When you find an oasis in the midst of a desert you tend to run towards it. Something similar happened with our Shahenshah fall for fake video on social media which displayed a rain cloud generator. The summer has hit India this year very badly due to which many areas suffered severe drought and may be out of the same concern, Amitabh Bachchan too fell for this social media mirage.In the video, it has been claimed that NASA has developed the generator. The clip shows a machine that is creating artificial clouds that can lead to instant showers. This is not the first time that this video has made its way to social media, in fact, last year it was widely circulated as well. The clip was shared by a user on Twitter which was then retweeted by Big B who wrote, "... can we get one in India .. I mean right now .. RIGHT NOW .. PLEASE !!"Meanwhile, on the professional front, the actor is currently busy shooting for Shoojit Sircar 's 'Gulabo Sitabo' along with Ayushmann Khurrana and Nalneesh Neel . He will also be seen in Ayan Mukerjee's ' Brahmastra ' alongside Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor
