'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah': Sunder Lal brings 9 Dayaben to Gokuldhaam Society to test Jethaa Lal

Earlier today it was confirmed that Disha Vakani is indeed making a comeback as Dayaben on the hit show 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah' and that too after two long years. The actor shot for the show on Sunday and like reported, she is going to be a part of Navratri celebrations at Gokuldhaam Society. Her husband Jethaa Lal played by Dilip Joshi had vowed that he won't play Garba if Daya doesn't join him. However, her brother Sunder Lal promises his brother-in-law that he will bring Daya back just in time during Navratri.

Sunder keeps his promise and he along with Dayaben has arrived at Gokuldhaam Society. However, there's a twist to the story, Sunder brings nine ghoongat clad women and asks Jethaa to guess who amongst those is Daya. The number nine has significance with Navratri since it is celebrated across nine days. If Jethaa is able to recognise Daya from those women, then he can perform Garba with his wife.

That's an amazing way to bring the favourite character back on the show, we must say!

Meanwhile, talking about Disha's return on the show, her husband Mayur Padia told Bombay Times, "She has shot for a portion of the episode, but our talks with the makers still remain unresolved. So, she will not return to the show for good. We are hoping that we reach an amicable solution."

While producer Asit Modi said, "Disha has finally shot for a small segment, and hopefully, she will resume shooting for the show full-time."
