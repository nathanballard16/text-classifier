Nikkhil Advani’s Batla House recreates events of September 19, 2008, when Delhi Police officers shot down two alleged members of the terrorist group, Indian Mujahideen. The men were accused of being involved in a series of bombings across Jaipur, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, and Delhi.

News reports of the operation pointed out discrepancies in the Delhi Police’s accounts, leading to a court-ordered inquiry by the National Human Rights Commission. Later, the officers’ names were cleared and Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, one of two police officers who headed the operation, was awarded the President’s gallantry medal.

Nikkhil Advani’s movie stars John Abraham as Sanjay Kumar, who is modelled on Sanjeev Kumar Yadav. The film script is written by Ritesh Shah, whose credits include Airlift, Pink, and Raid. Shah is an alumnus of Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University, where some of those killed and arrested during Operation Batla House had studied.

The film screens on August 15 in Indian theatres.
