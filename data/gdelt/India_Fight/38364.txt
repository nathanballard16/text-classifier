Dhurve is the second teacher to fall prey to a tiger in Madhya Pradesh in five years, according to The Times of India.

He went to the edge of the forest at 11am to forage for mushrooms near the Pench Tiger Reserve but had not returned by sundown.

The villagers became worried and started searching for him, finding his sandals first at 8.30pm.

They then traced the drag marks on the ground to the remains of the village teacher's body.

The Khawasa forest range was informed and a search party went hunting for the tiger, which has still not been found.

Locals fear the growth in the tiger population has seen a number of the big cats move out of the reserve into the forest.

Officials have told the villagers they will trap the tiger and move it to a secure location.

They also said they would provide financial assistance to Dhurve's family.
