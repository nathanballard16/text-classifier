Check out all the pictures here

Janhvi Kapoor became a star even before her debut film was announced. From walking along with her mother on the red-carpet to being spotted outside the gym, Janhvi has established herself as a star and it's her next project that has all our attention. After the success of Dhadak, it's her next project that fans have eagerly been waiting for. Apart from working with Karan Johar in his next joint venture, Janhvi has begun shooting for a biopic based on the life of Gunjan Saxena.

After stills were leaked online, she's currently in Lucknow and we just stumbled upon pictures of diva taking her break from shooting to shop in the city. A report in TOI reported that her next film, which is titled as Kargil Girl went on a 'shopping spree on Thursday.' The report added, "The actress, who went to a chikan store in Hazratganj, went crazy over a variety of chikan clothes, according to the store owner. The Dhadak actress purchased an exquisite sari, a sharara and a few kurtis for her family and friends. She even placed an order for customised clothes at the store."
