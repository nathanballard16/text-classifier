Varun Dhawan offered Arun Khetarpal’s biopic?

Varun Dhawan is currently at the prime of his career. Yes, he has some interesting projects under his belt. The actor is already looking quite promising as Zafar in Kalank. And after that, he will also be seen in Remo D’Souza’s Street Dancer 3D alongside Shraddha Kapoor. He will also star in his father David Dhawan’s film which is an adaptation of Coolie No 1. Amidst so many impressive films, we hear that Varun has also been offered a biopic based on the life of Lt Arun Khetarpal PVC.

Arun Khetarpal was an Indian Army officer who was killed in the India-Pakistan war of 1971. The Pune based officer was posthumously honoured with the Param Vir Chakra title. In the 1971 war, it is said that Khetarpal fought with his remaining two tanks and destroyed 10 tanks before he was killed. Well, it would be interesting to see Varun play such a glorious character on the big screen, no? While we are scooping out more information on this front, let us know what you think about Varun in this role. In the past, we saw Varun in an intense avatar in Badlapur.

Currently, on the work front, Varun is busy promoting his period-drama Kalank. The film is directed by Abhishek Verman and produced by Karan Johar. Varun will be seen alongside Alia Bhatt, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanjay Dutt, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Kunal Kemmu in the film. While Dhawan’s co-star Alia has signed the Arunima Sinha biopic, we will have to wait and see if Varun takes up this biopic or not.
