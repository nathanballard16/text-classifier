Penguin India terminates agreement with Vijaypat Singhania, tells court it won't work on his autobiography

Freshly Brewed Controversy The Bombay High Court has restrained industrialist Vijaypat Singhania from releasing his tell-all memoir. Here are other tomes that took a page out of controversy’s book.

Plagiarism Plague In June 2012, American rapper Jay-Z (in pic) was sued by writer Patrick White. The latter claimed that large parts of the musician’s 2010 autobiography, Decoded, was a product of plagiarism. White claimed that his laptop was stolen in 2009, a year before the book was published, and that the book contained “expressions/colours/ phrases” that co-related to his work. In fact, the book was a collection of Jay-Z’s songs and the story behind how each one was made.

Fallen Cyclist After Lance Armstrong (in pic) confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs, two of his fans sued him in January 2013 for lying in his two memoirs — It’s Not About the Bike (2000) and Every Second Counts (2003). Rob Stutzman and Jonathan Wheeler said they wouldn’t have bought the books if they knew they were works of fiction.

A Fictional Saga American author Augusten Burroughs (in pic) was sued by his foster family, the Turcottes, for defaming them in his 2002 memoir Running with Scissors. In his book, Burroughs describes his life after his chainsmoking mother asked her psychiatrist Dr Rodolph Turcotte to be his legal guardian so that he could attend school in Northampton, Massachusetts. The Turcottes filed a suit against him in 2005 claiming large parts of the book were untrue. These included the family condoning affairs between adults and children and keeping an electroshock machine hidden under the stairs. Burroughs settled the suit in 2007. The book was then classified as fiction instead of a memoir.
