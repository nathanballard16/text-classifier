Man held in TN for killing ex-employer's father in Mumbai

A man was arrested in Tamil Nadu for allegedly killing his former employer's 70-year-old father in suburban Borivali last week, police said on Thursday.

The accused, identified as Mahesh Chandra Gouda, who hailed from Karnataka, used to work in the shop of the victim's son earlier, police said.

According to police, Waman Malhar Joshi was murdered by an unidentified person while he was alone at his residence on April 18.

His son Vilas Joshi, 35, lodged a complaint in this connection and a case under section 302 (murder) of IPC was registered, a police official said.

"During the probe, it came to light that the attacker had also looted Rs 10,000 from the house. Accordingly, relevant sections of the IPC were added in the case," he said.

Police suspected the role of persons known to the victim and accordingly started keeping a tab on the movement of the victim's relatives as well as the people who worked in Joshi's shop.

"It was learnt that Gouda, who used to earlier work in the complainant's shop, had come to Mumbai on April 16. Police informers confirmed that Gouda had returned to his village in Karnataka," the official said.

However, he was later nabbed from Tamil Nadu on Wednesday night, the officer added.

Further investigation is on.
