"While not even a single penny from MPLAD funds has been allocated from the entire area of Gulha and Cheeka, the MP gave Rs 5 lakh for the development of a piece of land that was disputed," he said. "An attempt was made to create communal unrest in the area, but the matter did not go out of control," he alleged.Sirsa also promised a library in the village gurdwara in the name of deceased Shamsher Singh.Later, Haryana Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) president Didar Singh Nalvi also visited the village and demanded a probe into the incident.MP Raj Kumar Saini has already said that while allocating funds from the MPLADS, he was not aware that the land for which the grant had been sought was disputed.
