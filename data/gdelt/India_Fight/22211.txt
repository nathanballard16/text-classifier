IAF Review Claims India Struck 5 Targets in Balakot Airstrike - Report

It also lauds the Indian Air Force for maintaining an element of surprise, ensuring the security of operations, the pilot's proficiency and the weapon's accuracy in hitting the designated targets. It also features hitherto unpublished details of the operation, based on extensive debriefing and assessment.

"In hindsight, we achieved our aim, hitting five of the six DMPIs. Only one was unused. But considering the nature of the propaganda war that needed to be won, we could have used a weapon which would have flattened the target and we could have also sent a platform that gets us clear images or video of the destruction," the daily reported, citing sources.

The IAF review also says that the security of the operation was of the highest order, with no breach of communication networks despite involvement of over 6,000 people one way or the other. It also reveals that the actual target at Balakot was known to less than 10 persons at the Air Headquarters (AHQ).

Interestingly, since the 26 February air strike, a controversy continues to fester between India and Pakistan over the veracity of the attack.
