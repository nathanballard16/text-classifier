Watching this programme will make you want to visit different parts of India and add to discourse of environmental conservation," the PM tweeted.The 45-second-long clip teases the episode as an "epic adventure of a lifetime" and the one that unites "an ace adventurer" with "the leader of the world's largest democracy".As they explore the wild lands of Jim Corbett, Bear presents Modi with a makeshift spear and promises to keep the "most important man in India" safe.
