About one month ago, his wife had moved to another place after a tiff with her husband, police said.On Monday night, when the news of Singh's death spread, several advocates assembled at his house and demanded that police should carry out an investigation into the case as some blood spots were found near the body.Police, however, said when they entered the house, they found that Singh's leg was trapped in an electric wire. The television was on which indicated that he might have been electrocuted after falling on the floor, they added.
