One person was shot dead and three others were seriously injured in Bhatpara area of West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district as clashes broke out between two groups on Thursday, a police officer said.

The deceased had been identified as Rambabu Shaw, while the details of those injured in the incident were yet to be ascertained, he said.

“Some anti-socials and criminals have been active in Bhatpara. Outside elements have now joined them, disrupting peace in the area. RAF personnel have been deployed,” Home Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said.

The West Bengal government has taken a serious note of the situation in certain areas under the Barrackpore Police Commissionerate, including Bhatpara, which has witnessed a series of clashes since May 19, when bypoll was held in the Assembly constituency.

ADG South Bengal Sanjay Singh has been given particular charge of the Barrackpore Commissionerate, the senior state government official said.

DG Virendra has also been asked to rush to Bhatpara, Bandyopadhyay added.

According to reports, bombs were hurled and several rounds of bullets fired in the air by the members of the two warring groups near the newly-constructed Bhatpara Police Station, which was inaugurated by the Home Secretary earlier in the day.

Meanwhile, authorities on Thursday imposed Section 144 in Bhatpara and Jagatdal areas of North 24 Parganas district following the clashes.
