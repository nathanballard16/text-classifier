Show roadmap on easing curbs: SC to Jammu and Kashmir admin

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Jammu & Kashmir government to furnish a roadmap on easing restrictions on movement and the internet in the Kashmir valley even though the administration responded that 99% of areas in J&K had no restrictions on any movement.A bench of justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta: “How many days do you (the government) want the restrictions to go on? You have to come with a clear roadmap. The situation has to be rev-iewed from time to time.”Mehta replied: “The situation is reviewed on a daily basis and over 99% of areas in J&K has no restriction on any movement.”When the bench asked the government about plans to ease restrictions on use of internet, the SG said: “Internet use has trans-border implications. Let us not have an ostrich-like approach. Three years ago, a dreaded terrorist (Burhan Wani) was killed by security forces. The then administration had shut mobile phones and internet for three months. None of the present petitioners questioned the decision in the Supreme Court.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the apex court that 99% of areas in J&K had no restrictions on any movement.
