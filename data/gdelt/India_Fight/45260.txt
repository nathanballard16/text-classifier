Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai commissioned the INS Khanderi, Indian Navy's second submarine under the Project 75 India defence project.

Pakistan should be wary of the recent additions to our naval capacity as with them we could deliver them a bigger blow, said Union Defense Minister Rajnath Singh at the commissioning ceremony of the second Kalvari-class submarine INS 'Khanderi' on Saturday.

"Pakistan should understand that today with the strong resolve of our government and advancement in naval capacity with additions like INS Khanderi, we are capable of giving a much bigger blow to it," Singh said at an event here.

The official Twitter handle of the spokesperson of the Indian Navy announced the commissioning and welcomed the submarine into the Indian Nacy's fold.

Project 75 India (P75I) is India's bid to build conventional submarines as part of defence strategic partnership, adding on to the current 14 conventional and two nuclear-powered submarines.
