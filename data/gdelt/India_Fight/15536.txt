New Zealand terror attack: One of 5 Indians killed hailed from Hyderabad

One more victim of the terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch belonged to Telangana and family members of him and of another feared dead are on their way to New Zeland.

According to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) sources here, Ozair Kadir, identified by the Indian High Commission as among the five Indians killed in the attack, was a resident of Noorkhan Bazar area in the city.

The sources said Kadir's brother was on way to New Zealand. His father is working in a Gulf nation.

Ahmed Iqbal Jahangir, a city resident, has been injured in the massacre Friday, while Farhaj Ahsan, an engineer from here, was feared dead.

AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi had tweeted on Saturday night that Ahsan had passed away.

It identified them as: Maheboob Khokhar; Ramiz Vora; Asif Vora; Ansi Alibava; and Ozair Kadir.

Meanwhile, the parents of Ahsan are expected to leave for New Zealand Sunday night, a family member said.

Similarly, Khursheed, brother of Jahangir would also travel to New Zeland.

A cousin of Ahsan recalled his childhood and their stay at Hanmakonda (Warangal) in Telangana, saying he was a bright student who did his engineering course from a city college.

Fifty people were killed in the attack in two mosques in New Zealand and five of them were identified as Indians Sunday by the Indian High Commission there.
