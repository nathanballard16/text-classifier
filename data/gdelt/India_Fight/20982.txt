A Mid Day report quoted a source as saying, “Since the script revolves around a desi wedding, the makers are looking at unexplored venues in Delhi and Rajasthan as the two places beautifully capture the essence of India. A luxury villa in Ranthambore has also caught their attention. For now, the team is working on the screenplay. Once the script has been locked by August, a production team will fly down to do a recce across North India. Since there are a few similar themed films in production at the moment, including Mira Nair’s series A Suitable Boy, the team will have to scout for unique locations in the cities.”

The tabloid further said that the film will go on floors by November. “Priyanka will be caught up with the promotions of The Sky Is Pink, starring Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim, till October. Only after the Shonali Bose-directed film hits the marquee will the actor be able to dive headlong into the comedy,” the source added.

Dan Goor, the co-creator and executive producer of the popular sitcom, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, will write the film with Mindy and also co-produce it with Mindy and Priyanka.
