NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven people including three staff members were killed Saturday due to suffocation after entering septic tank of a hotel in India's western state of Gujarat, police said.

The incident took place in Dabhoi in Vadodara district, 161 km south of Gandhinagar, the capital city of Gujarat.

"Seven people, four sanitation workers and three hotel staff, were today choked to death after entering a septic tank at hotel here," a police officer posted in Dabhoi said.

"We are being told initially the four sanitation workers entered inside the tank with the purpose of cleaning it and when they didn't come out, three hotel staff members went inside to look for them and with this all the seven were killed."

Following the incident, police team and firefighters rushed to the spot to retrieve the bodies from the tank.

Police have registered a case and ordered investigations into the deaths.

"A case has been registered against the hotel owner and investigation will follow," the police officer said. "Apparently the deaths have taken place because of inhalation of poisonous gas. The bodies have also been sent for post-mortem."

The incident triggered chaos in the hotel and in the adjoining areas.

Laborers in India usually ignore safety standards during working hours.
