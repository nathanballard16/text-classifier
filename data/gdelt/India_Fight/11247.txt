Modi Thanks Putin for Support in Fighting Cross-Border Terrorism

The Pakistani military said on Wednesday it had shot down two Indian warplanes in the disputed region of Kashmir and captured a pilot, responding to an airstrike a day earlier by Indian aircraft against what New Delhi said was a camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad, considered a terrorist group by India, and located on the Pakistani soil across the so-called Line of Control (LoC).

The Indian airstrike came after a deadly attack by Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Indian paramilitary police force in Kashmir last month. While India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militants and having a "direct hand" in the incident, Pakistan, in turn, has rejected the allegations, accusing India of being responsible for human rights violations taking place in Kashmir.

India and Pakistan both lay territorial claims to Kashmir. Jaish-e Mohammed has staged several attacks in northern India since it has emerged reportedly in 1999 and is known to have close ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
