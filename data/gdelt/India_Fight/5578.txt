Ensure safety of Bengalis in Assam: TMC MPs

New Delhi: The Trinamool Congress on Tuesday accused the BJP of playing “dirty politics” in Assam and urged the Union government to ensure the safety of Bengali people in the state.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MPs Dinesh Trivedi and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that the Bengalis living in the northeastern states are feeling unsafe.

“We have seen how Bengalis residing in Assam have been brutally killed in broad daylight. You will appreciate the fact that our delegation had gone and seen first hand how the Bengalis have been murdered there,” Trivedi said.

“This dirty politics of the BJP has to stop. You must stop killing Bengalis in Assam,” he added.

Chowdhury said Bengalis move out of West Bengal in search of livelihood but are not feeling safe in Assam.

“They are being killed. The Centre should ask the state to ensure their safety,” he said.
