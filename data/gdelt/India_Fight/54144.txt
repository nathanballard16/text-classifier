The accused were killed in the early hours of Friday when they allegedly snatched weapons from the police and tried to escape from Chatanpally near Shadnagar, 50 km from Hyderabad.

Police sources said they were gunned down at the same spot where the accused had dumped the victim’s body and set it afire on the night of November 27 after the gangrape near Shamshabad on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

The accused were taken to the spot by the Cyberabad police for reconstruction of the crime scene as part of the investigation.
