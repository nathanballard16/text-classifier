Two of her relatives were killed in the accident. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has taken over the probe into the accident, booked 10 people for murder, including BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who is already in jail, charged with the rape of the Unnao woman when she was a minor in 2017.

The apex court had directed to shift the injured to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi for better care, as she was still critical.
