NEW DELHI, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes broke out between lawyers and police in the Indian Capital on Saturday afternoon, in which one lawyer was reportedly injured.

According to media, it all started when cops beat up a lawyer for wrongly parking his vehicle, following which lawyers also beat up policemen and later set a police vehicle on fire.

The violence occurred at the Tis Hazari district court in north Delhi. Gun shots fired by the Delhi Police cops were also heard during the violence, said the media reports.

Advocate Vinayak Sharma, a lawyer from the court, told Xinhua that initially a heated exchange took place between a lawyer and a couple of cops outside the criminals' lock-up situated at the court premises.

"During the heated exchange of words, one cop fired at the lawyer. This firing incident enraged the lawyers community, and soon it spread among all the advocates inside the court. Soon, all the lawyers gathered together and assaulted the cops present on the spot," added Sharma.

According to him, the violence was still continuing and the lawyers had blocked the roads outside the district court.

Advocate Raj Kumar Yadav, another lawyer at the court, said that situation continued to be tense both inside and outside the court. "One lawyer received a bullet injury in his shoulder and he has been admitted in a nearby hospital. Lawyers in all the courts across Delhi have given a call for one-day strike on Monday against the high-handedness of the Delhi Police cops," added Yadav.

Meanwhile, the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) strongly condemned the "inhuman act" of firing gunshots by Delhi police, and demanded the arrest of all the policemen responsible for firing on innocent advocates.

Further details are awaited.
