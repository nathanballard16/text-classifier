India should release evidence of air strike, says Digvijaya

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday demanded that India should release evidence of IAF air strike on a training camps of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan's Balakot, like the US did after killing Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.

Speaking to reporters here, the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister said: "I am not raising any question over the IAF's operation. But this is the era of technology. It is possible to find out any picture of an open area via satellite. We should give evidence like America informed the whole world about Osama bin Laden."

The Indian Air Force (IAF) had carried out a pre-dawn air strike on February 26. The air strike came in response after the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force troopers were killed on February 14 and Pakistan-based JeM claimed responsibility.
