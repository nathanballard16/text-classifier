Pakistan is stunned as India retracts Kashmir’s semiautonomous rights

India's action Monday, which stripped Kashmir of numerous rights, "is not a decision they have taken out of the blue," Khan said. "It is ingrained in their ideology that puts Hindus above all other religions." India will "now crack down even harder on the Kashmiri people," he predicted, adding: "I fear they may initiate ethnic cleansing in Kashmir to wipe out the local population."
