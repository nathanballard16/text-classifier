India does away with Kashmir's autonomy

New Delhi

Tension built for 10 days in a Himalayan valley that is as scenic as it is turbulent.

In rugged Kashmir, India sent in thousands more troops without an official explanation. Authorities canceled a famed Hindu pilgrimage. Police evacuated tourists. Phone and internet connections were shut down.

Then, on Monday, with most Kashmiris unable to follow the news, the Indian government revoked the limited autonomy held for decades by its only Muslim-majority territory.

The controversial move to withdraw Kashmir's special legal status fulfills a longstanding goal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party. It also appears certain to heighten tensions with rival Pakistan — which also claims Kashmir — and trigger a violent backlash among separatist insurgents and civilians bitterly opposed to Indian rule.

"Today marks the darkest day in Indian democracy," Kashmiri political leader Mehbooba Mufti tweeted, calling the change "illegal and unconstitutional."

Modi's top lieutenant, Home Minister Amit Shah, announced the presidential decree in Parliament, drawing angry outbursts from opposition members who argued the move violated the constitution and denied Kashmiris the right to self-determination promised to them for more than 70 years.

The decree, once approved by a legislature dominated by members of Modi's party, will cancel Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which grants the territory the right to its own constitution and bars outsiders from buying land, holding government jobs and receiving scholarships.

Removing those restrictions could pave the way for Hindu settlers to move into the area to dilute the Muslim population.

Pakistan's government said it "strongly condemns" India's effort to change Kashmir's status unilaterally, arguing that the bilateral dispute was a matter for the United Nations Security Council. In India, the legality of the presidential order was not immediately clear.
