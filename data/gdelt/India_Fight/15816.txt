Bihar: Rapid Action Force jawan shot dead in Muzaffarpur

A Rapid Action Force(RAF) jawan was shot dead by bike-borne miscreants in Muzaffarpur's Kazi Mohammadpur Thana area.

The incident took place when the deceased, identified as Sudhir Kumar Manjhi, tried to clear a traffic block in the area.

The two youth, sitting atop a bike, had blocked the movement of vehicles and were asked to move by Kumar. Irked by this, the accused fired at Kumar.

Muzaffarpur's SSP Manoj Kumar said the RAF jawan was being rushed to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries on the way.

"There was traffic, he (Sudhir) tried to clear it and was shot. He died on the way to the hospital. We'll examine CCTV footage and make arrests soon," Manoj told reporters here.

Investigation in the matter is underway.
