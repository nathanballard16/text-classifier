The Navy, in a statement, said that the fire was brought under control by the ship’s crew “in a swift action, preventing any serious damage to the carrier’s combat capability”. “Lt Cdr D S Chauhan bravely led the fire fighting efforts in the affected compartment and while the fire was brought under control, the officer suffered loss of consciousness owing to smoke and fumes,” it said. He was immediately evacuated to a naval hospital at Karwar for medical attention but could not be revived.
