India-Saudi joint statement on MbS visit stresses need for Indo-Pak dialogue

KARACHI: The joint statement by India and Saudi Arabia on the visit of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman issued Thursday stressed on the need for resumption of a comprehensive dialogue between Pakistan and India.



"The two sides stressed the importance of regional stability and good neighbouring relations," read the joint statement.

"In this context, both sides agreed on the need for creation of conditions necessary for resumption of the comprehensive dialogue between India and Pakistan."

The Saudi crown prince led a delegation to India after his visit to Pakistan earlier this week.

The India-Saudi joint statement comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours over February 14 attack in Pulwama district of Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK).

Some 44 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed when an explosives-packed van rammed into a convoy transporting 2,500 security forces in the district, in the deadliest attack in the valley in 30 years.

The attack followed New Delhi's blaming of Islamabad for the incident, which was strongly denied by the Pakistani leadership.

Earlier this week, PM Khan responded to Indian rhetoric with an offer to investigate the Pulwama attack and act if New Delhi shared "actionable intelligence with Pakistan."

Khan, however, made it clear that if the Indian side thought they would attack Pakistan, then Pakistan would not just think but retaliate.
