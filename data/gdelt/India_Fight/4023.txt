The Indian Air Force has confirmed that two senior pilots were killed after they ejected from a Mirage 2000 fighter during its take-off run at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru Friday morning.

The pilots have been identified as Squadron Leader Sameer Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddartha Negi, a statement by the HAL said.

The incident took place at 10.30 am. The Mirage 2000 is equipped with 'zero-zero' (zero speed, zero altitude) ejection seats which enable the pilots to bail out even if the aircraft is on the ground and is not moving. It is unclear at what stage of the take-off run the fighter was in when the pilots decided to eject.

The aircraft was on an acceptance sortie after an upgrade by the HAL.
