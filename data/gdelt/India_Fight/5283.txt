The band will share the stage with legendary metal bands, like Slayer, Kiss, Bullet for my Valentine, Testament, Parkway Drive, Cradle of Filth, and many more at “Wacken Open Air”, the biggest metal music festival in the world. This year, the festival will take place from August 1-3.

Trainwreck features Abir Ahmed Shuvo on vocals, A K Rahul and Ekram Wasi on guitars, Habibullah Farhan on bass, and Mark Don on drums.

Earlier, the band won the first Wacken Metal Battle, Bangladesh chapter, in December 2018. The selection process of the battle was very competitive.

Approximately 77 bands sent their demos to the Bangalore Open Air committee from which five bands were selected.

Later, the five bands performed in the metal battle with their original numbers in front of a jury panel and a crowd of metalheads. Each band performed for 30 minutes.

As a first local heavy metal band, Trainwreck has started a crowdfunding movement in our country.
