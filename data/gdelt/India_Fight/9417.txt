Pulwama attack: Probe NSA Ajit Doval to reveal truth, says Raj Thackeray

NEW DELHI: The chief of Indian extremist political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) Raj Thackeray called the Indian soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack “political victims” and said the truth would be revealed if the country’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval was probed, Geo News reported.

“If NSA Ajit Doval is investigated, then all the truth about the Pulwama terror attack will come out,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by the Indian media. The MNS chief said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was shooting for a film at the time of the Pulwama attack. “Even after the news of the terror attack, his (Modi’s) shooting continued”.

Speaking about the Indian soldiers killed in the attack and calling them political victims, Thackeray further said, “Every government manufactured such things, but it is taking place more frequently under Modi’s rule.”

Following the Pulwama attack in Held Kashmir, the government of Indian Prime Minister Modi levelled baseless allegations of Pakistan’s involvement. Prime Minister Imran Khan has called on New Delhi to share actionable intelligence with Pakistan. “Pakistan is ready to investigate the attack and act if India provides actionable intelligence. Not because we are under pressure but because it is our policy,” PM Imran said in a televised address to the nation last week.
