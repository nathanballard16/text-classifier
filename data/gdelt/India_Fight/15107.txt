Couples should tolerate ordinary wear and tear of married life and avoid fighting for sake of children: SC

NEW DELHI: Giving a word of advice to married couple to avoid fighting legal battle for divorce and custody of children, the Supreme Court on Friday said that husband and wife should try to bear the “ordinary wear and tear of married life” for the larger interest of their offspring as the fight adversely affects the mind and psychology of child.“Spouses must come over the temperamental disharmony which usually exists in every marriage, rather than magnifying it with impulsive desires and passions. Parents are not only caretakers, but they are instrumental in the development of their child’s social, emotional, cognitive and physical well being and work harmoniously to give their children a happy home to which they are justly entitled to,” a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Ajay Rastogi said.While adjudicating a custody battle of US-based NRI couple, the bench said, “Divorce and custody battles can become quagmire and it is heart wrenching to see that the innocent child is the ultimate sufferer who gets caught up in the legal and psychological battle between the parents.”In this case, the husband and the wife, both green card holders and settled in the US, had been fighting battle for custody of their seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter since 2016 and they had filed case in US court. During the pendency of their case in the US, the wife took the children and returned back to India in 2017 and she refused to go back to US.US court passed the order directing her to bring the children, both US citizen by birth, back from India but she refused to comply the order, compelling the husband to file habeas corpus petition in Andhra Pradesh high court. The HC passed the order in favour of husband and directed her to hand over the custody to him. She thereafter moved SC.She contended that the interest of the children would be best protected if they remained with her in India. But advocate Prabhjit Jauhar, appearing for the husband, told the bench that being born and brought up in US, the children must be repatriated to US when the case on custody is pending.The court, after hearing both sides, said the best interest of the children being of paramount importance will be served if they return to US and enjoy their natural environment with love, care and attention of their parents and to resume their school and be with their teachers and peers. It also suggested the couple resolve their differences for the sake of children and start over their relationship afresh.“We accordingly direct the appellant to return to US along with both the children within a period of six weeks from today. We further direct respondent (husband) to make all arrangements of stay and travel expenses(including air tickets) for her and both the children as well as her companion, if any, in their own house or if she is not willing to stay for any personal reasons, make all arrangements for stay at the place of her choice at reasonable cost,” the bench said.The court further said that if wife was not inclined to go to US then Consulate General of the US at Hyderabad will take the custody of the children along with their passports and other travel documents and be handed over to the husband who will also deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of his wife to meet her expenses.
