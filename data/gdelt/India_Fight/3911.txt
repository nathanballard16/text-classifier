New Delhi: Shocking revelations have been made after the mobile phone of the suspected rapist, Manish Chaddha was confiscated. With photos of naked children to conversations with sex workers, the serial rapist's phone was full of explicit content. The phone of the accused was taken on Wednesday, a day after he was held.

Allegedly, the images in the phone were of children that he was acquainted with. However, no clarification has been given confirming that he was a paedophile. Chaddha also admitted to using the services of sex workers even though he did not have money to pay them.

A police officer told the Hindustan Times that he found easy targets in children from poor neighbourhoods. Majorly targeting children who used to play alone, Chaddha made sure that he never frequented localities where his relatives lived. On CCTV footage, the police officer added that he was specially cautious with them. Whenever he reached the areas with CCTV cameras, he pretended to talk on the phone.

The accused mastered the art of deceiving people as he sported a clean shaven look and wore suits while committing his crimes. Chaddha had a rather quite image in front of his mother. His uncle, KG Chaddha told HT that the accused had shifted to his house with his mother after the death of his father.

Chaddha's aunt, Santosh said that the accused was into gambling and betting and often used to raise his voice at his mother. The hunt for Chaddha had begun around 3 am when the police raided his house on Tuesday. Anticipating the raid, Manish had managed to flee but was caught by 3.30 am.
