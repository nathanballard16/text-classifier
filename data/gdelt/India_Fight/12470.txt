'Please Stop,' Wife of IAF Pilot Killed in Budgam Crash Tells Social Media 'Warriors'

New Delhi: Vijeta Mandavgane, whose husband was one of the Indian Air Force pilots killed in the Budgam crash, has slammed those who support war with Pakistan on social media.

“We don’t want a war. You don’t know the damages of war. We don’t want more Ninads to go. Social media warriors, please stop. If you want war, go to the front,” she said.

Squadron Leader Ninad Mandavgane was cremated with full military honours in Nashik on Friday.

“We do not want war. You do not realise the damage a war inflicts on people… No other (Sqn Ldr) Ninad should be lost from either side,” his widow said. “I would want to request these social media warriors to stop doing what they are doing. Nothing will come out of this. If you have so much ‘josh’ then join the force and see how it feels.”

Her reference to ‘josh’ was because of a dialogue from the film Uri, about the 2016 ‘surgical strikes’, which has been used by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, as well as several Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and supporters.

Vijeta Mandavgane said for those who truly care about India, there are many productive ways to show it – and social media war-mongering is not one of them.

“Instead of that, if you truly want to bring about change, for my Ninad, for WC Abhinandan and the martyrs, do a small thing. Either join the forces or make your family members join the forces. If you can’t, then at least bring about small changes around you to help the nation. You can keep your surroundings clean, not litter the roads, not urinate in the public, not harassing girls.”
