George Reddy trailer grabs eyeballs

The trailer of George Reddy, a biopic on the student leader of Osmania University in the 60s and early 70s, is intense and interesting. Directed by Jeevan Reddy, the film features Sandeep Madhav of Vangaveeti fame in the title role, and narrates the story of the well known student leader who was murdered at a young age by his rival group.

The filmmakers erected a big set of Osmania University in Hyderabad and have taken care to ensure the university looked exactly like it did in the year 1967. “Students who studied between 1965 and 1975 in Osmania University know about George Reddy. But the present generation do not know about him, so we want to tell them about this unsung hero,” says director Jeevan Reddy.

George Reddy became a strong student leader at very young age. He was a daring person who raised his voice against any wrong doing.

The film’s trailer, which was released on the occasion of Dasara, got a good response. Distributor and producer Abhishek Nama, who has bought the theatrical rights of the film, says, “The film is in post-production right now and I bought the theatrical rights after watching the trailer, which I liked very much.”
