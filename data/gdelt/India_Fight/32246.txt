Many locals opposed the renaming and condemned the school education department for allowing the same.After receiving the direction from the corporation, the school removed ‘Drona Paathshala’ from the the board.District chief educational officer P Santha said, “The provision of renaming the government schools was struck down many years ago. So, we have directed the school administration to run the school with the old name itself. Since it was a corporation property, the matter was forwarded to the civic body.”Corporation commissioner K Sivakumar said, “We have written to the school headmistress to remove the the new name from the board. The old name will be retained for the school.”On a Facebook post, native cattle breeding expert Karthikeya Sivasenapathy asked: “Why the school was renamed after Dronacharya in Tamil Nadu? Tirupur has witnessed many freedom fighters and employees’ union martyrs. If it was renamed after one of them, the students would have known about his brave history.”As the buildings became weak, the Rotary Club of Tirupur Prime chipped in and constructed classrooms at a cost of Rs 75 lakh in the school and renamed it as ‘Drona Paathshala’. State school education minister K A Sengottaiyan inaugurated the building recently.
