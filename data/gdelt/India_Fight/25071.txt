Dynasty can make you party chief, but it doesn't bring vision, wisdom: Modi's dig at Rahul - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

INDORE (MP)” Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday, saying dynasty can take him to the top position of a party, but it “doesn’t bring vision and wisdom”.

Addressing a rally in Indore, Modi expressed confidence about his re-election, claiming that while there was anti-incumbency against the Congress-led UPA Government in 2014, there is pro-incumbency now.

He said people from Kanyakumari to Kashmir have decided to re-elect his Government.

He said the Congress’s arrogance reflected in its senior leader Sam Pitroda’s remark “hua toh hua” about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. (AGENCIES)
