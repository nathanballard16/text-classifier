UP: Dalit siblings shot dead at their home in Kaushambi

ALLAHABAD: Unidentified persons barged into the house of a dalit widow and shot dead her two teenaged children in neighbouring Kaushambi district late on Wednesday night.The murder of siblings Sheela (17) and Rajendra (15), residents of Bakshi Ka Pura village in Paschim Sarira police station area, sparked an hour-long protest on Thursday morning during which villagers prevented police from taking the bodies away for autopsy.While the motive behind the killings is not immediately clear, preliminary probe has exposed a web of intrigues. First, the door to the house was locked from inside. Second, the perpetrators hid Rajendra’s body in a heap of straw, but let his sister lie on the floor. Third, no villager heard gunshots between Wednesday night and Thursday morning.Deputy IG (Prayagraj range) KP Singh, who inspected the crime scene along with Kaushambi SP Abhinandan, said three police teams had been formed to investigate the case.“Mother of the teenagers Saroj Devi was away visiting her married elder daughter in Barauli. She returned home on Thursday to find the main door locked from inside. The door was opened with the help of neighbours and there were puddles of blood on the floor. The teens had been shot in the chest and abdomen,” DIG Singh said.The senior officer maintained that while Saroj Devi had told police she had no idea why anyone would kill her children, her dispute with some people since January over a plot of land could not be ruled out as a trigger. “The double murder will be probed from all angles,” he added.
