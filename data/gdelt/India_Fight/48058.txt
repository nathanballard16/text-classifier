3 taken into custody, in connection to Hindu group leader Kamlesh Tiwari's murder

LUCKNOW: Three persons were arrested by the Gujarat ATS in Surat on Saturday for killing the president of Hindu Samaj Party, Kamlesh Tiwari "All three who were arrested have confessed to the crime," ANI quotes Gujarat ATS DIG Himanshu Shukla as saying.UP Police DGP OP Singh told media persons in Lucknow that three persons identified as Maulana Sheikh, Faizan, and Rashid Pathan have been arrested in Surat and are being interrogated. All the three are in their 20s."Pathan was the mastermind of the conspiracy to murder Kamlesh as the former had made disparaging comments against Prophet in 2015," said Singh.“We are working in collaboration with the Gujarat ATS and till now no link with any terrorist organisation has been established. We will look into all the details and take action,” he said."A unit of Lucknow police is also interrogating the trio. A sweet box recovered from crime spot was a vital clue in cracking the case," he added.The DGP also said that Mohammed Mufti Naeem Qazmi and Imam Maulana Anuwarual Haq have been detained from UP's Bijnor.“Prima facie it appears that the killing was linked to Tiwari's remark on Prophet Muhammad in 2015, but nothing has been confirmed so far. The killers were probably radicalised after Tiwari made the controversial remark against Prophet,” said the DGP.Tiwari was shot dead at Naka area of Lucknow on Friday. He was the former leader of Hindu Mahasabha and had founded the Hindu Samaj Party.
