Environment activists see red over installing idols in lakes

VADODARA: Environment activists are up in the arms against the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ’s (VMC) plans to erect big statues in the lakes in the city.The activists have shot off a letter to the civic body and mayor terming the proposed projects as contempt of court too.“The move to erect tall statues inside the lakes along with islands is environmentally disastrous. Such projects cause concretization of the waterbodies and end up harming them. Creating an island in the middle of the lake reduces the size of the water body,” said Dr Jitendra Gavali, director, Community Science Centre.The letter signed by several environment activists, educationists and landscape architects states that the development projects are concretizing the waterbodies in the name of beautification. “The interconnectivity of the lakes that was done during the era of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III for better flood and water management is being also being cut off,’ they said.“Having such concrete structures at lakes like Sama, Wadi and Chnani will reduce underground water recharging and availability of water,” Gavali told TOI.The civic body is mulling two statue projects at Wadi and Sama lake. In Wadi lake, a 108-feet tall idol of Lord Hanuman proposed by a trust that has blessings of BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava has been cleared by the civic body. In Sama lake, a 100-feet tall idol of Lord Parshvanath proposed by Jain International Organization has been approved by the VMC.“This is a clear contempt of Gujarat high court. The court had in 2000 clearly directed the state government to project, maintain and preserve all the water bodies in the state which are identified as per the development plans and town planning schemes,” said Rohit Prajapati, environment activist.“The government bodies cannot convert waterbodies and put them for other use in town planning schemes. Such concretization of the lakes will only cause further water woes,” Prajapati added.The Nature Walk Group too has opposed such projects and asked the VMC to work on water harvesting projects that will improve underground water table.
