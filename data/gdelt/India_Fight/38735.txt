Constitutional supremacy or parliamentary supremacy?

LET me try to explain this as simply as possible so that ordinary citizens who are not lawyers can understand. It is extremely important to our lives.

Every informed citizen knows that for any civilised society to function in a peaceful and orderly manner, it requires laws. We need laws to regulate various aspects of the society’s affairs, including the government itself. Good and just laws are able to provide a conducive environment for citizens to earn a decent living, allow their talents to flourish and the country to be great. In our country we have the Parliament (and the State Assemblies) that makes the laws. This is called the Legislature.
