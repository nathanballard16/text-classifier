Indian army waved white flag against Pakistan during UPA tenure: minister

The Indian Armed Forces (IAF) used to wave the white flag every time Pakistan violated the ceasefire at the border, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday.

Addressing a rally in northeast Delhi's Yamuna Vihar, Singh said there would have been “no need for the IAF to enter the Pakistani airspace to hit the Balakot terror camp if it had Rafale aircraft.”

He said a "miracle would have been possible” from Indian territory.

"During the UPA government's tenure, the Indian Army would hoist a white flag whenever the Pakistani forces violated the ceasefire at the border. During my tenure as home minister, I gave orders that if Pakistan fires one bullet, then you fire as much as you can," Singh said.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the same argument, saying it would have been different if India had Rafale fighter jets, as he attacked India’s opposition Congress party for its tirade against his government over the aircraft deal with France.
