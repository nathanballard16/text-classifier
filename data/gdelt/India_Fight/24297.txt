The letter, it turned out, was a hoax. Years later, the man who sent it — the brother-in-law of one of the men accused in the letter — was given a conditional sentence. The man charged in the case, 42-year-old Raheel Maroof Bughio, turned himself into city police in January 2018, according to a statement of admissions filed in Edmonton provincial court April 23.

Article content Bughio was charged with making a false statement and hoax regarding terrorist activity — a charge that can be laid against people who “convey information that is likely to cause a reasonable apprehension that a terrorist activity will occur, without believing that the information is true.” City police turned the investigation over to the RCMP’s Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET). The letter that arrived in the mail at Edmonton police headquarters on April 5, 2016, was the first of two sent to police. Police noted the typed letter contained numerous grammatical errors as well as information about the alleged terrorists that only someone close to them would know, including their immigration histories and a home address.

Article content The letter says one of the people was visiting Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for a “final meeting with Daesh regional commanders” (Daesh is an alternative name for the so-called Islamic State, also known as ISIS). Within a week, a second, similar letter arrived at the Summerlea police station in West Edmonton Mall. The note concludes: “Please do some thing quickly; otherwise so many killing will be happen in the Edmonton.” Police eventually determined that none of the people named in the letter were involved in terrorist activity. A few days after receiving the first letter, INSET investigators interviewed a husband and wife named in the document. The man said that his wife’s younger sister is married to Bughio. She, along with her two young children, had recently left Bughio after a fight — during which she called police — and were staying with her sister’s family.

Article content Edmonton Bughio tried to track her down, sending his sister-in-law text messages on April 4 — two days after Bughio’s wife went to stay with family. The texts from Bughio, which were in a mix of English and Urdu, mentioned the allegations in the letters. The texts also claimed that the woman’s husband belonged to RAW, India’s foreign intelligence agency, and that he had been shot in the foot in the late 80s while in Pakistan — a claim also made in the letters. The sister-and-law took Bughio’s wife to get a protection order. According to the statement of admissions, Bughio’s wife returned home the next day. She was interviewed by police April 12, during which she said her husband disliked his brother-in-law. He told her he was going to “get back at” him for comments about his mother and sister by telling police he is terrorist.

Article content The wife added that Bughio had done the same thing before in Pakistan, to a relative of another woman who he was supposed to marry. The same day as the interview, police arrested Bughio, seizing a laptop and other electronics. In an interview conducted in Urdu, Bughio denied to police that he wrote the letters. A friend later interviewed by officers, though, said Bughio sought him out the day of his arrest and confirmed, by writing on a newspaper, that he had written the letter. INSET investigators found a copy of the letter in the recycle bin on Bughio’s laptop on April 20, 2016. The next month, Bughio left Canada for Pakistan, telling RCMP in an email months later that he had left to care for his dying mother. Bughio eventually returned to Canada and turned himself into Edmonton police headquarters on January 10, 2018. Interviewed that March, he continued to deny sending the letters, according to the statement of admissions. Bughio, through lawyer Cristian Manucci, declined to comment. Bughio has no previous criminal record. He was sentenced to six months for each of the two charges last month, to be served concurrently in the community. He is also subject to two years of probation. jwakefield@postmedia.com twitter.com/jonnywakefield
