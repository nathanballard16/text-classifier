Down but not out

Actor Naga Shaurya for instance, got badly hurt recently while shooting for an action sequence for his upcoming film, Ashwatthama in Visakhapatnam. The actor slipped and fell down from a building slab while shooting for a chase scene, and suffered a ligament tear in his leg. Admitting that the accident was a lucky escape, the actor further states, “It is emotionally draining to be lying down and not shooting. Actor Gopichand too suffered a serious injury while shooting an action sequence for his forthcoming film, Chanakya in Rajasthan. “As actors, we are vulnerable to various risks since we do different kinds of things before shooting and on the sets too.
