Maharashtra Assembly Elections: ‘BJP-Shiv Sena Seat Sharing Tougher Than India-Pakistan Partition,’ Says Sanjay Raut

“Had we sat in Opposition instead of being in government the picture today would have been different. Whatever we decide on seats we'll let you know,” he said.

Though the process of electioneering has begun in Maharashtra for the upcoming assembly elections, the seat-sharing formula between the BJP and Shiv Sena is still not finalised. Speaking on the seat-sharing arrangement between the two parties, both of which want to contest on maximum seats, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has stated that this partition of seats is even more terrible than the partition of India and Pakistan. “Maharashtra is so huge and this division of 288 seats is even more terrible than the division of India and Pakistan,” Raut said.
