BJP must take its MLA Sadhna Singh to task for the abusive and derogatory language she used while referring to BSP leader Mayawati. Such undignified conduct is unacceptable in any profession or in public spaces, and not just in politics. Politicians as torchbearers of the country’s constitutional democracy cannot be seen to be taking misogynistic or casteist positions.

The country’s politicians are shooting themselves in the foot with such unbecoming conduct. Only last week, BJP president Amit Shah, down with swine flu, was at the receiving end of Congress leader BK Hariprasad’s foul tongue. Hariprasad himself was slighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in shameful remarks that were expunged from Rajya Sabha records.

The decline of liberal democracies across the world should serve as a warning sign to petulant Indian politicians. The PM too has been a regular recipient of distasteful remarks from opposition leaders and as is evident this is a vicious cycle that has become entrenched in the rough and tumble of Indian politics. With Lok Sabha elections approaching, tempers are bound to rise. The Election Commission has tried to intervene with little effect. But EC has other critical areas of electioneering where it has to play umpire. It is for political parties to tell their leaders to uphold decorum or face action.
