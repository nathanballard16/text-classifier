In Pics: Ayushmann Khurrana Posts Pic Dressed In Skirtâ€™ Fans Ask â€˜Did Ranveer Singh possess youâ€™

New Delhi:

Ranveer Singh stunned fashion police when he turned at a public event in long skirt and waltzes around public platforms with the same air of confidence with which I walk around in my boxer shorts strictly on my terrace. His fashion sense became fodder for memes so much so that wifey Deepika Padukone was in awe of it and is still the talk of tinsel town.

Bollywood one of the most commercially successful actor Ayushman Khurrana recently tried the same brave feat as he took to Instagram to share a photo doning a skirt. Fans couldn’ t keep calm and compared him with Ranveer’s outlandish fashion choices. While some felt may be he is up fpr a movie with the ‘Gully Boy’ actor’ some opined he should stay clear from Ranveer’s influence. “Did Ranveer Singh possess you’ commented one of the Insta user.

On work front, Ayushman is awaiting the release of ‘Bala’ that centers around a man who is suffering from premature balding and becomes the butt of jokes. The actor is also currently shooting for Subh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan with his Badhai Ho co-stars Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao in Varanasi.
