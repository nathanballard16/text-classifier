Girl gang-raped in front of her father in Bihar’s Kishanganj

Survivor names six persons as accused; police on their trail

A teenage girl was allegedly gang-raped by six youths after tying her father to a tree nearby in Kishanganj district of Bihar.

The girl, in a complaint filed on Wednesday, said six youths of her village Pathargatti, under the Kodhobari police station, 350 km from Patna, knocked on her door on Monday night asking for water. They then forcibly entered the house and dragged her outside. They took her to a deserted field near her house and gang-raped her in front of her father, she said in her complaint. The victim told the police that the accused warned them not to report the incident.

Arrests soon, says SP

“She has named six persons… the police are conducting raids to nab them as they are absconding,” Kishanganj Superintendent of Police Kumar Ashish told local journalists. He said he was personally monitoring the case and “all the accused will be arrested soon.”

Police said the villagers initially tried to hush-up the incident. They asked the girl and her father to agree to a “settlement” through the village panchayat. But the two decided to lodge an FIR.

Police records say 1400 cases of rape were registered in Bihar till November last year, 39 in Kishanganj district alone.
