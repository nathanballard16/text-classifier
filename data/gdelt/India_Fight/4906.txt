Family arrives home to find leopard in the house

Feb. 7 (UPI) -- A family returned to their southern India home after a few days away and discovered it had been invaded by a dangerous squatter -- a leopard.

Forest Department officials responded to the home in Pattavayal, near Gudalur in Tamil Nadu, when the Rayan family arrived home from a wedding and found a leopard had moved into their home while they were away.

The leopard was captured safely using a trap and relocated away from the village, officials said.
