RJD-supported candidate Nishant Kumar was elected for the post of Vice President after he was declared winner over Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) candidate Priyaranjan with a margin of 701 votes.

The JAP-AISF coalition prevailed over other parties including for the post of Joint Secretary where its candidate Amir Raza defeated his nearest rival and Janata Dal-U candidate Hansika Dayal with a margin of 1120 votes.

Priyanka Srivastava, of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was elected to the post of General Secretary after she emerged as the winner over her nearest rival and Independent candidate Ujjwal Kumar by a margin of 862 votes.

All India Students Association (AISA) candidate Komal Kumar defeated Independent candidate Nishant Kumar by a difference of 426 votes for the post of Treasurer.

The polls began at 8 am and ended at 2:00 pm.

Interestingly, besides the sole victory of Priyanka Srivastava for the post of General Secretary, none of the candidates backed by the BJP and JD-U was elected to any post indicating a possible decline in the popularity of the NDA government in Bihar.

Elections for the Patna University Students Union was, by and large, peaceful besides a clash outside B N College when a group of students opened fire on another group.

No one was said to be hurt in the firing. Police took two students in custody.
