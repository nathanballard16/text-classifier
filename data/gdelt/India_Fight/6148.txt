Late last night, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a brief statement condemning the suicide attack in Kashmir’s Pulwama district that killed 45 members of India’s armed forces, terming it a “matter of grave concern”, but “strongly denied” any links to the attack.In doing so, Pakistan maintains the stance it has taken in respect to militant attacks in the region. It has refuted giving help to militants, instead claiming that it offers them moral support in their pursuit of self-determination However, as India prepares a full-scale investigation into the attack, as part of a larger mandate of retribution by way of an “unforgettable lesson” , Pakistan will have no choice but to reckon with the fact that the attack - the worst in two decades in Kashmir - had its origins on home soil. And do something about it.Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a Pakistan-based terrorist outfit, has claimed responsibility for the attack and even released a video clip of the suicide bomber - Adil Ahmad Dar, one of its commanders and a local militant. India has accused the government in the past of enabling the JeM to carry out its operations.In fact, most attacks in recent years have been carried out by attackers with links to either the JeM or, another Pakistani outfit.In response, India has reiterated its demand for Pakistan to stop supporting terrorists. It has also consistently pressed for the chief of JeM, Masood Azhar, to be recognised as a terrorist under a UN Security Council charter.In addition to the India, many Western countries have been vocal about Pakistan’s inability to curb homegrown terrorism. US President Donald Trump has expressed his concerns about the country’s status as a safe haven for terrorists, even cancelling $300 million dollars in aid to Pakistan in September last year owing to its failure to target terrorist groups.SEE ALSO:
