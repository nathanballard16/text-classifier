Court records: Holt man was killed with camp ax by wife and her lover

DELHI TWP.— Police believe a Holt man was killed by his wife and the man she was having an affair with, according to court records.

Ammar Al-Yasari was found dead in his home Feb. 4 after his wife called 911 for medical assistance, Ingham County Sheriff's Office Detective William Lo testified in a hearing that led to criminal charges.

Both his wife, Bdour Al-Yasari, and Jacob Ficher were charged with murder in connection to Ammar Al-Yasari's death. Bdour was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

Ammar Al-Yasari's autopsy showed a blunt-edged object was likely used to kill him, Lo testified.

Police found packaging for a camp ax that matched Ammar Al-Yasari's injuries at Ficher's residence in Lansing.

On the day of Ammar Al-Yasari's death, a neighbor told police he saw someone enter the home at 5:30 p.m., several hours before Bdour called the police, Lo testified.

Ficher was a "no call, no show," from work that day, Lo testified.

Multiple people told police Bdour Al-Yasari and Ficher were in a romantic relationship, Lo testified, although the pair refused to answer questions from police about their relationship.
