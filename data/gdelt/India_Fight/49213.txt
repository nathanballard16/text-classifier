‘Uddhav Holds The Remote Control Of Power’: Shiv Sena’s Drama Continues Post Maharashtra Results

The Shiv Sena on Sunday (27 October) shot off a warning to its alliance partner BJP by a claiming that the “remote control of power” now rests with Uddhav Thackeray, Times of India has reported.

This claim has been made by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut in the party’s mouthpiece Saamna.

“The Sena won less seats this time, 56 compared to 63 in 2014, but it has the remote control of power”, wrote Raut.

Soon after the election results were announced, the Shiv Sena has insisted on a 50-50 Chief Ministerial sharing agreement wherein it will have its own Chief Minister for 2.5 years.

This agreement was purportedly finalised by the party with BJP president Amit Shah back in February.
