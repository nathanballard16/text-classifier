Opposition takes potshot on BJP's double engine plank in Jharkhand as Rs 800 crores GST dues pending from Centre

RANCHI: Amid the din on electioneering, Jharkhand is staring at a financial crisis to the tune of over Rs 800 crore as the Centre has withheld payment of the state’s share of GST compensation since August.Talking to TOI on Sunday, a senior official of the state commercial taxes department said on the condition of anonymity, “GST compensation of a little over Rs 800 crore is pending from the Union government. We aren’t receiving it since August and do not know how long the impasse will continue.”Officials added that delay in non-payment of dues will further impact the health of Jharkhand’s balance sheet.“Taxes are the only way to generate funds so that the government employees can be paid and welfare schemes can be implemented. Any delay will impact development works in the coming days,” he said, adding that the only solace at the moment is that with the model code of conduct in place, no new projects will be rolled out.When contacted for comments, Shiv Chandra Bhagat, joint commissioner of the state commercial taxes department, said they have sent a reminder to their counterparts at the Centre in this regard. He said, “We have recently written to the government of India urging it to clear the dues.”Recently, many non-BJP ruled states highlighted the issue of GST dues and threatened to approach the Supreme Court. But in poll-bound Jharkhand, where the BJP is invoking benefits of double-engine government to woo voters, opposition parties questioned the Raghubar Das-led state government’s deliberate silence over the issue.Congress’s spokesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo took jibes at BJP’s double-engine government plank. “Citing benefits of double-engine government, the PM in his rallies always claim how they are giving funds to Jharkhand, when the reality is exactly the opposite. The irony is that Raghubar Das government is conveniently silent about it,” said Shahdeo, adding that non-payment of dues to several states is also testimony to the fact how economy under the Modi government is in tatters and the country's coffers have gone empty.“They (BJP) talk of development but the reality is that after pushing the country into economic crisis, the Modi government is now damaging the financial health of the states. If states don’t get money, how will development works be executed?” he questioned.
