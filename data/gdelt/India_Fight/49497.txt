Market capitalisation of IRCTC share hit Rs 15,000 crore on Friday compared to Rs 10,736 crore on the listing day.

Rahul Agarwal, Director at Wealth Discovery/EZ Wealth said, "As on today, the stock has already gained 184 percent from its listing price. At a current price of Rs 910, it is trading at a P/E multiple of 53.53 times to its FY19 EPS.

Along with the monopoly business which include catering, online ticketing and packaged drinking water, and other services such as non-railway catering, e-catering, executive lounges and budget hotels, there are a few other earning triggers that will play out in the next couple of years for IRCTC.

The online ticket booking charges which were removed in 2016 have been brought back by the Ministry of Railways from September 1, 2019. Now IRCTC it will charge a rate of Rs 15 for Non-AC and Rs 30 for AC ticket without any revenue sharing with the ministry, unlike earlier. We see significant revenue and margin traction in second half of FY19 and first half of FY20 due to these changes.

IRCTC is a unique business with no comparable peers, and little risk to earnings unless there is a change in policy.

Based on parameters such as strong earnings profile, diversified business segments, healthy return ratios, debt-free status and monopoly business we are bullish on this stock in the long-term, but considering the recent rally, the upside is limited for short-term. For investors, our advice is to continue holding the stock. For investors who are trying to get in, it would be better to wait and enter if and when the stock sees some meaningful correction."

The IPO received bids for 225.39 crore shares compared to the issue size of 2.01 crore shares. The public issue was a part of the government's divestment programme for the financial year 2019-20.

The government which owned 100% in IRCTC sold 12.6% stake in the firm. After the IPO, government's stake in the firm fell to 87.4%. The issue involves sale of 2.01 crore equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each in a price band of Rs 315 to Rs 320. The attractiveness of the firm's business can be gauged from the fact that IRCTC enjoys monopoly across its area of operations and is backed by the government.
