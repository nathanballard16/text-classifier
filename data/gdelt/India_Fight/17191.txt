PM Modi congratulates Mission Shakti scientists: You have shown 'hum bhi kisi se kam nahin'

Buoyed by the successful testing of Anti-Satellite (A-SAT) missile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said: "Hum bhi kisi se Kam Nahi (We are no less than anyone)."

The Prime Minister made this comment during an interaction through video-conference with the team of scientists and engineers involved in the development and testing of the Anti-Satellite weapons.

"Congratulations to you all. Your hard work paid off," Prime Minister said.

"If someone who does not think ill about anyone becomes powerless, then those who think ill will keep breeding evils. That is why someone who does not think ill for others must be powerful," Prime Minister told the scientists and engineers.

He also termed the successful development of the weapon as an example of "Make-in-India".

India on Wednesday announced successful testing of its anti-satellite missile by shooting down its own decommissioned satellite in the Low Earth Orbit.

Making the announcement about the test, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India's feat is only for its own defence needs and not for use against any country.

Prime Minister Modi also assured the international community that this test does not violate any international treaties or law and that India remains committed against the arms race in space.

India has now entered the elite international club of four countries having such a capability.

"India has successfully registered its name as a space power. Till now three countries of the world- America, Russia and China had this feat. India is the fourth country to have achieved this feat. There could be a no bigger moment of pride. A short while ago our scientists have shot-down a live satellite in low earth orbit (LEO) in space through an anti-satellite (A-SAT) missile," Prime Minister Modi had said.
