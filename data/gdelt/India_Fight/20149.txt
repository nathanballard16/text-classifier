Actor Varun Dhawan, who is gearing up for the release of Abhishek Varman’s partition drama, 'Kalank' revealed that he will start shooting for the next schedule of Remo D’souza’s dance film, 'Street Dancer 3D' from May 5.

“The film is shaping up amazingly well, and we all had lots of fun on the sets in London. Of course, it’s a physically exhausting film but I can’t wait to start the next schedule on May 5. After that, we have another stint in Mumbai, which would result in a wrap,” said Varun while interacting with Mirror.

He went on to add that though the film is not a part of his 'ABCD: Any Body Can Dance' franchise, it is inspired by true events. “ABCD 2 was based on a real life incident and for that matter, even Street Dancer is based on a lot of real life instances. We are doing it in a masala way, but it’s nice to do it like that,” he smiles.

The dance film, produced by Bhushan Kumar, also stars Shraddha Kapoor, Nora Fatehi and Prabhu Deva in a pivotal role. The team took the film on floors in Punjab in January followed by a prolonged schedule in London.

Touted as the biggest dance film of India, 'Street Dancer' is gearing up for a November release. In his next, 'Kalank', Varun plays the character of Zafar, who is in love with Roop, played by Alia Bhatt. The Karan Johar Production, also starring Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt, will hit the theaters on April 17.
