4 buildings sealed for violations

Ludhiana: Acting against violations of building byelaws, civic officials sealed four buildings on Wednesday in areas falling under Zone A. Officials claimed there were violations related with parking space and floor area ratio (FAR), so they took action against owners.

The buildings were sealed in Salem Tabri, GT Road, and Jalandhar Byepass Road near Basti Jodhewal. These were commercial buildings where there was no adequate parking space in the building. As per building byelaws, it is compulsory for commercial buildings to have parking for visitors coming there. The buildings had covered more area than allowed in FAR.

Confirming the move, Zone A assistant town planner Harvinder Honey said they sealed four such buildings where there was violation of bylaws. Notably, even on Tuesday, MC had sealed one Verka booth in Model Town Extension. The officials had sealed the booth because the allottee had constructed the roof without permission. However, the allottee claimed the roof was in a bad condition, so he had started repairs and had also applied with the civic body for permission.
