The Chinook helicopters of the Indian Air Force have arrived in the country and the first batch of four of these tandem-rotor planes were offloaded at the Mundra port of Gujarat today.

"The CH-47F (I) Chinooks will be ferried to Chandigarh, where they will be formally inducted in the Indian Air Force later this year," Boeing said in a release.

The CH-47F (I) Chinook is an advanced multi-mission helicopter that will provide the Indian armed forces with unmatched strategic airlift capability across the full spectrum of combat and humanitarian missions. The Indian Air Force currently has 15 Chinook helicopters on order.

The ahead-of-schedule arrival of the Chinooks validates Boeing's commitment to delivering on its promise of modernising India's defense forces, the firm said. Through its current partnerships with Indian Air Force and Indian Navy, Boeing has ensured a high rate of mission readiness and increased operational capabilities, it added.

Boeing has strengthened its supply chain with over 160 partners in India, and a JV to manufacture fuselages for Apache helicopters. Annual sourcing from India stands at $1 billion. Boeing currently employs 2,200 people in India, and more than 7,000 people work with its supply chain partners. Boeing's employee efforts and India country-wide engagement serve communities and citizenship programs to inspire change and make an impact on more than 2,00,000 lives.
