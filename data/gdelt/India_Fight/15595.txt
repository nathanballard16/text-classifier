With Shashank Khaitan's Dhadak, Boney Kapoor and late Sridevi's daughter, Janhvi Kapoor made her big Bollywood debut. The diva, who has undoubtedly become B-town's favourite, not only impressed the audience with her spectacular performance but has also bagged many interesting projects. Apart from this, with her uber-chic sense of style, Janhvi has also become a trendsetter for many millennials. Recently, she made our heads turn with her bold avatar.

Last night, the 22-year-old actress stepped out donning a gorgeous white and silver one-shoulder gown with a thigh-high slit. Janvhi teamed up her outfit with a pair of shimmery dangler earrings and strappy beige heels.

Janvhi backcombed her hair and let her locks open. Her kohl-rimmed eyes with purple eyeshadow and nude lips made her look even more radiant. Take a look.
