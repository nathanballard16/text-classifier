Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) headed by Masood Azhar has claimed the responsibility.

The outfit which claimed the attack told local media houses that a suicide bomber identified as Adil Ahmad, a resident of Gundi bagh in Pulwama carried out the attack.

This is the first time in many years the terrorists have used explosive-laden vehicle to carry out strikes.

In the past JeM was responsible for the 2106 Pathankot Air Force Station, which killed seven security personnel and the terror attack on the Indian brigade headquarters in Uri killing 19 soldiers, the deadliest attack in over two decades.

JeM founder Azhar, who was jailed in India since 1994 was freed in exchange of the hostages of the hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.
