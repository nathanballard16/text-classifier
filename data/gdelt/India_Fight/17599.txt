PM Modi lashed out at the Opposition for raising doubts over Balakot air strike.

Launching his campaign in eastern India with a rally in Jeypore area of Odisha\'s Koraput district, Modi said the NDA government wouldn\'t have been able to do any development work in the country without the support of the people.

He came down heavily on opposition parties who he said \"belittled\" the space achievement.
