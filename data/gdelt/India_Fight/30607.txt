4 soldiers lost in one day, as key Pulwama attack man killed

The Indian Army on Tuesday killed yet another militant linked to the Pulwama attack that took away the lives of 40 CRPF troopers earlier this year. Despite losing four soldiers in the past 24 hours in Jammu and Kashmir, the Army was successful in killing the Jaish man whose car was used in the February 14 attack.
