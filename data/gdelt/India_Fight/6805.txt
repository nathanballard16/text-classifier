Navjot Singh Sidhu Sacked From ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’ After Insensitive Remarks On Pulwama Terror Attack

Punjab cabinet minister and well known public personality Navjot Singh Sidhu has been axed from The Kapil Sharma Show, which runs on Sony TV, in the wake of his contentious remarks on the Pulwama terror attack, reports The Indian Express. His replacement on the show will be Archana Puran Singh.

“Nations cannot be held responsible for the dastardly acts of terrorists. The terrorists do not have deen, mazhab (sect and religion). There are good, the bad and the ugly. Every institution has them. Every nation has them. The ugly need to be punished. But individuals cannot be blamed for the dastardly act,” Sidhu had stated during a media interaction.

His comments drew widespread backlash from the general public as they were seen to be condoning Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terror against India. A strong campaign calling for his ouster from the show took root on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

The Pulwama attack, in which more than 40 CRPF jawans were martyred, was carried out by a suicide bomber who belonged to Pakistan-based Jihadist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Pakistani intelligence agencies are believed to sponsor the group’s activities and its leadership is provided a free reign to do as they please by the Pakistani government on its territory.
