SpiceJet signs MoU with Emirates for code-share tie-up

Mumbai: Budget carrier SpiceJet on Monday said it has inked an initial pact with Gulf-based Emirates for code-share partnership, a move that will give wider connectivity to its passengers on the latter's network across the US, Europe, Africa and Middle East.

In turn, Emirates' passengers will enjoy unhindered access to SpiceJet's 51 domestic destinations -- 10 through direct connectivity and rest 41 through connecting flights, the airline said.

SpiceJet's first code-share partnership with Emirates, which is subject to regulatory approvals, assumes significance in the back drop of the temporary grounding of domestic carrier Jet Airways, which has investment from Emirates' rival carrier Etihad.

Before grounding all its flights to and from Etihad's hub Abu Dhabi on March 18, Jet Airways had sizeable operations to the UAE capital city.

"I am delighted to announce that as part of SpiceJet's international expansion strategy, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a code-share agreement with Emirates.

This new partnership should immensely benefit passengers travelling on both airlines," SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh quoted.

Code-sharing allows an airline to book its passengers on its partner carriers and provide seamless travel to destinations where it has no presence.

This is SpiceJet's second partnership, since Singh took over control of it, with an overseas airline.
