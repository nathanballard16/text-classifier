Vadodara: Two months after undertrial’s death, murder case lodged

VADODARA: The death of a casual labourer, who had collapsed in Vadodara Central Jail on March 17, has turned to be a murder.On Saturday, Raopura police lodged an offence of murder in connection with the death of Naresh Thakor, who was arrested along with his mother Savita and sister-in-law Geeta on March 15 by Makarpura police. They were arrested in a case of cheating and forgery.On March 17, Naresh was rushed to SSG Hospital after he collapsed in the jail and he died on March 19 morning. Since Naresh was in judicial custody and passed away as an under-trial, a case of accidental death was registered at Raopura police station and assistant commissioner of police (C division) Megha Tevar conducted the probe.The murder offence was lodged on the basis of doctors’ report and the postmortem which revealed several internal injuries which could have been caused due to thrashing by sticks and rods.“When Naresh was sent to the jail, he was fine, but he was not attacked inside the jail. The postmortem revealed that he was beaten up at least five to six days before his death,” said Tevar. She added that it is possible that Naresh could have been thrashed by some persons before his arrest on March 15. The post-mortem revealed that Naresh had several internal injuries on his kidney, lungs and other organs which caused brain haemorrhage.While officials claim that Naresh could have been beaten up before his arrest, the FIR states the place of occurrence of crime as Vadodara Central Jail.“We have taken statements of inmates and jail staff but nothing happened inside ,” Tevar said, adding that Naresh had told the judicial magistrate at the time of production that he was not beaten up by police.Meanwhile, the Raopura police is looking into Naresh’s call detail records before his time of arrest and checking the footages of CCTV cameras installed near his house in Makarpura to find out who all met him before the arrest.
