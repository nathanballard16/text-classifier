Congress MLA Vishwajeet Kadam suffers minor injuries in car accident

Congress member of legislative Assembly (MLA) Vishwajeet Kadam sustained minor injuries after his car (a Mercedes) met with an accident on Wednesday night in Pune.

The MLA from Palus-Kadegaon assembly constituency in Sangli district said in a tweet that the accident happened when the car hit a tree while he was returning from Mumbai to Pune.

Kadam in a tweet said, “While on way to Pune from Mumbai, my car met with a minor accident after it hit a tree. Fortunately nothing untoward happened. I have sustained minor injuries on my left shoulder,” the tweet said.

Deepak Lagad, Deccan Gymkhana police station incharge said, “We are not aware about the incident and have not received any report or official complaint about the accident.”

At Kadam’s residence ‘Sinhagad’, on Agarkar road, in front of BMCC College, the secretarial staff at the residence confirmed the accident, but said that they were unaware of the accident spot.

Some post-accident images of Kadam’s Mercedes car, which made rounds on social media, showed serious damage to the vehicle, with the front two airbags being deployed, said police officials.
