My Father Was Killed Despite Security, Can't Trust Govt: Kamlesh Tiwari's Son Demands NIA Probe

A joint team of Uttar Pradesh Police, Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad and Gujarat Police on Saturday detained three persons from Surat in the brutal daylight murder of former Hindu Mahasabha chief at his office in Lucknow. Addressing a press conference here, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) O.P. Singh said, "A joint team of UP and Gujarat Police has detained Maulana Mohsin Sheikh, Faizan and Khurshid Ahmed Pathan and is interrogating them."

Despite getting as assurance from the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath that those guilty will not be spared, family of fringe Hindu Samaj Party leader Kamlesh Tiwari has demanded a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). "We want the National Investigation Agency to investigate the case, we do not trust anyone. My father was killed although he had security guards, how can we possibly trust the administration then?," Tiwari's son Satyam was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. I am not sure if the men arrested by police have murdered my father or if someone else did and innocent people are being framed. If these are the actual culprits and the police have video evidence, the NIA should take over the probe. If they probe and these people are found guilty, we will be satisfied. We do not have belief in this administration," Satyam said while speaking to reporters. Even mother of Kamlesh Tiwari has alleged he was killed by a local politician over a land dispute. "No one asked me what I feel, who I suspect. He (local politician) got my son killed. He is a land mafia. We had a dispute over a temple land," Kamlesh Tiwari's mother, Kusum, told reporters outside her house.
