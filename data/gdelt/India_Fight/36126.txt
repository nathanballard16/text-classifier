Key Highlights India is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the victory of the Indian Armed Forces over Pakistani troops. Indian Army launched 'Operation Vijay' in which more than 20,000 troops were mobilised to recapture the region. However, the victory came at a heavy price with 527 troops laying down their lives for the nation.

New Delhi: On July 26, 1999, Indian Armed Forces defeated Pakistani forces after a three-month-long conflict at the icy heights of Kargil sector in Jammu and Kashmir. To commemorate India's victory in the war, the Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated every year since then and today marks the 20th anniversary of India's triumph.

To mark the occasion, President Kovind has hailed the "grit and valour of those who defended India", while Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute saying, "this day reminds of the courage, bravery, and dedication of our soldiers who favoured all in the defence of the motherland. Jai Hindi."

"On Kargil Vijay Diwas, a grateful nation acknowledges the gallantry of our Armed Forces on the heights of Kargil in 1999. We salute the grit and valour of those who defended India and record our everlasting debt to those who never returned. Jai Hind," President said.
