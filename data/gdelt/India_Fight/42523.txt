The body of the Bangladeshi man, who was gunned down by India's Border Security Force (BSF) along the Nimtola border in Sadar upazila of Chuadanga, has been returned to his family.

Najim Uddin, 34, was a cattle trader. His body was returned around 9pm on Friday, through the Pillar No 76 at Darshana check post along the border in Darmurhuda upazila of Chuadanga.

BSF handed over Najim's body to Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), after autopsy at an Indian hospital, following the holding of a flag meeting.

Dhopakhali BGB camp company Commander Rezaul Karim, Jibannagar Officer-in-Charge (OC) (investigation) Ferdous Wahid, and 10 others represented BGB at the flag meeting, while Gede BSF camp in-charge AC Sourav, and 10 others represented BSF at the flag meeting.

Najim Uddin was gunned down by BSF at Pillar No 74 at the border in the early hours of Thursday, when he, and seven others, were crossing the border to India to bring cattle, according to locals.

At one stage, BSF troopers from Gede Baganpara camp opened fire at them. Najim was shot, but the others managed to flee.

BGB’s Dhopakhali camp’s Company Commander Rezaul Karim, who confirmed the incident, sent a letter to the BSF camp, strongly condemning, and protesting the incident.
