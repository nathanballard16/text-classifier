Andhra: Two tribals killed by Maoists

Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) [India], July 18 (ANI): Maoists killed two tribals over suspicion of being police informers in Veeravaram village in Visakhapatnam district late on Wednesday, police said.

The deceased have been identified as Gemilli Bhaskar and Pangi Sattibabu.

According to police, Maoists murdered them after branding them as police informers and it was an act of revenge.
