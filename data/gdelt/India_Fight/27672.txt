2020 Tata Tigor (facelift) spied on test yet again

As Tata Motors continues testing the facelifted Tigor on the public roads, yet another batch of spy shots has surfaced online. IAB reader Yogesh Naik had spotted the upcoming sedan on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway recently.

The Tata Tigor embodies the IMPACT design language and was launched in March 2017. It was given a minor cosmetic update in October last year. With the mid-cycle refresh, it may get slight design changes in the form of a new upper front grille, revised bumpers, new alloy wheels and tweaked headlamps and tail lamps. Interior updates may include fresh seat upholstery and enhancements to the infotainment system and MID.

The Tata Tigor is available with the 1.2L Revotron petrol engine (85 PS/114 Nm) and the 1.05L Revotorq diesel engine (70 PS/140 Nm). The petrol engine can be teamed up with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automated manual transmission. The oil-burner comes mated only to 5-speed manual transmission. Upgrading the diesel engine to BS-VI standards is too expensive, and its demand isn't promising either. It is planned to be discontinued by March 2020, and so, the facelifted model may not come with this option.

The current top-of-the-line configuration of the Tata Tigor features a diamond-look front grille, projector headlamps with chrome finish, 15-inch dual-tone alloy wheels, LED tail lights, shark-fin antenna, faux leather upholstery with contrast stitching and a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system. The sub-4 meter sedan is sold in five trims - XE, XM, XZ, XZA and XZ+, with prices starting at INR 5,48,127 (ex-showroom Delhi).
