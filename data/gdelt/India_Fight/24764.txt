Best OnePlus phone 2022

The OnePlus 8 continues to be a great overall option in 2021, provided you can get a good deal on the device. It isn't on sale at the moment, but we've seen this phone available for as low as 300 bucks, so if you can get it for anywhere in the vicinity of $400, you're getting yourself a stellar value.

The OnePlus 8T is a solid choice. The hardware has plenty to offer, and you get a flat 120Hz AMOLED panel, 65W fast charging, and bloat-free software. With the OnePlus 9 series launch, the 8T has seen a discount, which makes it an attractive option in 2021.

The Nord CE 5G is nearly identical to the Nord, but it comes with a Snapdragon 750G chipset and a 64MP camera at the back that doesn't take quite as good photos. The plastic build also doesn't make it feel quite as upmarket, but there is a decent value to be had here. If you're on a tight budget and want clutter-free software, the Nord CE 5G is a good enough option.

The OnePlus Nord isn't officially sold in the United States, but if you happen to live in a market where the phone is available, it stands out as one of the best values. The Nord delivers a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 765G chipset with 5G connectivity, and four rear cameras.

The OnePlus Nord N10 5G delivers the same fundamentals as other OnePlus phones at a much more affordable cost. The phone comes with a 90Hz display, reliable cameras at the back, 30W fast charging, and you even get 5G connectivity. It will only get one Android update, but for what you're ultimately paying here, there is a lot to like.

The OnePlus 9R is limited to India and China, and the device has a lot of hardware similarities with last year's OnePlus 8T. You'll find nearly identical hardware, but the design is more in line with the OnePlus 9 series. If you want to save some cash and don't mind missing out on a few features — Hasselblad-tuned cameras and a glass body — the 9R is a decent alternative.

If you're looking for a more affordable option, the OnePlus 9 is a great choice. The phone delivers a great camera thanks to Hasselblad tuning, you get the same 65W fast charging, and there's now 15W Qi wireless charging, 120Hz AMOLED panel, and the latest hardware with 5G connectivity.

The OnePlus 9 Pro sets a new standard for OnePlus, with the phone offering a Hasselblad-tuned camera that holds its own against the best in the industry. You also get a sublime 120Hz AMOLED display, the latest internal hardware with mmWave 5G, 65W wired and 50W wireless charging, a gorgeous new design, and bloat-free software.

It started as a small enthusiast brand back in 2014, but OnePlus has quickly exploded into a mainstream hit that's responsible for making some of the best Android phones every year. So if you're looking for the best OnePlus phone but aren't sure which model to get, we've got a quick list to help you decide which one is right for you.

The best OnePlus phone right now is the OnePlus 9 Pro. You get everything you need in an Android flagship, including the Snapdragon 888 chipset with mmWave 5G, outstanding cameras, sublime 120Hz AMOLED panel, and bloat-free software that's a delight to use.

There's also 65W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, IP68 dust and water resistance, and stereo sound. Of course, you are paying a lot of money for the OnePlus 9 Pro, but it is on par with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, Xiaomi Mi 11, and other Android flagships.

If you're looking for a more budget-focused option, the Nord N10 5G continues to be a great choice in the U.S. The phone has reliable hardware with 5G connectivity and a decent 64MP camera at the back, and it offers a lot of value. The Nord CE 5G is a new entrant that offers many of the same features as the Nord for a little less money, but at the cost of cameras and build quality. With OnePlus starting to roll out phones faster than ever before, you don't have to wait too long before a new model shows up.
