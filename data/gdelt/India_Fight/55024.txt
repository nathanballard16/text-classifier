25-year-old killed, co-worker hurt as bike hits bridge railing

Ludhiana: A 25-year-old man was killed and his co-worker critically injured after their motorcycle ran into the railing of Sidhwan Canal bridge in BRS Nagar, near municipal corporation Zone D office, early on Tuesday. Police said neither Chintu Kumar, who died on the spot, nor Sumit Kumar, 21, who is under treatment, were wearing helmets.

Sarabha Nagar police station SHO sub-inspector Madhu Bala said, “Chintu, who hailed from Meerut, Sumit, a native of Amritsar, and a few of their co-workers lived in a rented accommodation in Sunet village. They all worked for caterer Kamal, also of Sunet.”

The duo’s co-worker Kuldeep Singh said, “Chintu and Sumit had gone out for dinner and did not return home Monday night. The next day, we learned about the accident.”

The sub-inspector said it was suspected that their bike was speeding. “After the driver lost balance, the bike climbed the curbside and rammed into the bridge railing. Chintu had sustained fatal head injuries. We are yet to find out who was driving the bike,” she added.

Passersby called up the ambulance and the police. The two were taken to a nearby hospital, where Chintu was declared brought dead. Sumit was referred to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital.

Police said they would record the statement of Sumit when he was fit to give it.

Police have initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC, on the statement of Chintu’s brother, Kapil Kumar.
