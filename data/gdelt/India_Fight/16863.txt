Day or night, no enemy out of sight: Why IAF’s new Chinook heavy-lift twin-rotor helicopter is a 'game-changer'

The Chinook played a role in every major military action by the US since its induction in 1962. This has seen it deployed in the Vietnam War, Korea, 1991 Gulf War, and the War on Terror in Afghanistan and Iraq. It was also part of the overall fleet of aircraft that were part of Operation Neptune Spear, the US air raid on Pakistani territory that killed terrorist Osama bin Laden.

The Indian Air Force has welcomed the newest member to its fleet of transport helicopters. The US-made CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift twin-rotor helicopter is set to be formally inducted into the IAF at a ceremony at the Chandigarh Air Force base.

Speaking at the event, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa spelled out how the Chinook would change things: “Chinook helicopter can carry out military operations, not only in day but during night too; another unit will be created for the East in Dinjan (Assam). Induction of Chinook will be a game changer the way Rafale is going to be in the fighter fleet.”

The Chinook is among the most recognisable helicopters in service around the world. It is presently operated by 21 militaries and a number of civilian operators. Apart from being deployed in military roles, the Chinook is also regularly used in relief and rescue and firefighting operations.

India had approved the purchase of 15 Chinooks in September 2015, along with 22 Apache attack helicopters at a cost of about Rs 198 crore.
