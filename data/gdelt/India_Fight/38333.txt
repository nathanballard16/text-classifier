Cop Brother & Maoist Sister Locked In Gunbattle In Sukma After He Told Her To Surrender

A team of 140 security personnel cordoned off a Maoist camp near the jungles of Balengtong in Chattisgarh’s Sukma district on July 29. The squad was lead by Vetti Rama, a commander of the operation.

They were searching for one of the top Maoist members of the Konta area committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), Vetti Kanni, and her 30-member team. Rama and Kanni saw each other and suddenly Kanni’s guards started shooting at Rana, whose men retaliated. Two Maoists were gunned down in the gunbattle and Kanni managed to escape.

Kanni and Rama are siblings.

They found themselves on opposite sides of the Maoist rebellion in Chhattisgarh. “I didn’t want to fire at her. I was constrained to do so because, within a few seconds, her guards started firing at my team. Hence I retaliated. Later, after a few minutes, I saw her firing and suddenly she disappeared in the jungle,” Rama told Hindustan Times.

A reward amount of Rs 5 lakh hangs over Kanni's head.

Both Rama and Kanni joined the Maoist movement in the early 1990s along with the other young people of Gaganpalli village.

“We both joined as bal sangham (child cadre) as we were told that the movement is for the poor of the region. But things have changed now… The present Maoist movement lacks dedication and hence I decided to surrender in 2018. I then got a job in the police and in the next couple of months, I will be promoted to the post of police constable,” said Rama, adding that he had led about 10 big operations for the security forces after surrendering.

But Rama surrendered and after he surrendered he wanted his sister to give up too. The rest time will tell.
