The bodies of the elderly couple and their domestic help were found with their throats slit on Sunday morning.

In its primary investigation, the police suspected that the accused were known to the family as there were no signs of forced entry into the house.

It was later found that Preeti was a close family friend of the couple. Her father was also a colleague of one of the deceased.

The elderly couple and their domestic help were killed with an intention of robbery, the Special CP said.
