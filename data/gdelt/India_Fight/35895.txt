Key Highlights Anand Piramal has invested an undisclosed amount in Snapdeal Snapdeal's revenue has jumped by 73% to Rs 925.30 crore, while its losses narrowed by 71% to Rs 187.40 crore.

New Delhi: Jasper Infotech, which owns and operates ecommerce portal Snapdeal, has bagged funding from Anand Piramal, executive director, Piramal Group. Piramal, in his personal capacity has made this investment.

This is the first external round in the company since it raised $21 million from Luxembourg-based Clouse SA in August 2016. The investment is estimated to be below $1 million,” a person familiar with the development, told a business daily.

Of late Snapdeal has come on investor's radar after it improved financials and cut losses. Snapdeal, which reported its earnings last week, said its revenue has jumped by 73% to Rs 925.30 crore, while its losses narrowed to Rs 187.40 crore, down 71%. Snapdeal is now focusing on value-conscious customers and has stopped fighting with ecommerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart.

“Snapdeal’s sharp execution in bringing great selection to the mass market segment in tier 2-3 cities has been quite successful, leveraging the growing internet penetration in these geographies,” Piramal said in a statement.

Snapdeal survived the sharp downturn witnessed in 2017 after its much-hyped acquisition by Flipkart failed to get through. Its founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal took control of the company and reoriented their strategy to focus on smaller cities.

SoftBank continues to be the largest investor in Snapdeal with 33% stake. The company was last valued at $2.5 billion in March 2017 when it raised Rs 113.2 crore from Nexus Venture Partners along with cofounder Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal.
