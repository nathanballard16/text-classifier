New Delhi: Indian security forces have been given clearance to shoot down any drone flying below 1,000 feet across the border in order to deal with increasing infiltrations by Pakistan-backed terror groups, said government sources on Sunday. However, reports also suggest that the final clearance to the security forces will be given by relevant agencies.

"Security agencies deployed along the international border have been given the clearance to shoot down drone crossing the boundary and flying at 1,000 feet and below," government sources told media.

The sources further added that the concerned agencies will sit and deliberate on it before giving the final clearance to the forces. There were concerns that sometimes low flying objects can be aeroplanes as well.

There have been increasing incidents of security forces including Border Security Force (BSF) spotting small drones crossing the border in Punjab. The forces have caught unmanned aerial vehicles trying to supply assault rifles and drugs into the India territory.

Earlier on Monday, a BSF personnel spotted a drone flying into India from Pakistan at Hussainiwala border post in Punjab's Ferozepur. The local police were informed about the incident and an investigation is underway.

Ties between India and Pakistan have soured ever since the Central government decided to abrogate Article 370 which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan has downgraded diplomatic ties with India demanding restoration of Article 370 while India continues to maintain that Kashmir is its internal issue.
