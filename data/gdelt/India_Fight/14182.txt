The film reportedly revolves around a character named Ashwath, born in the jungles of Kerala. Much to his animal-activist father's disappointment, Ashwath goes on to become a big-shot veterinarian in the big city of Mumbai.

When Ashwath returns to Kerala after years he decides to expose and fight against the elephant poaching racket in the country.

Vidyut's elephant friend is called 'Bhola' in the film. Director Chuck Russell has previously helmed Hollywood biggies such as 'The Mask', 'Scorpion King'.
