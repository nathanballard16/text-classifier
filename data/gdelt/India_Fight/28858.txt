Amit Shah gets ex-PM Vajpayee's Krishna Menon Marg residence

NEW DELHI: Home minister and BJP chief Amit Shah will soon move into the bungalow last occupied by the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee . The housing and urban affairs ministry has allotted the 6A, Krishna Menon Marg residence to Shah who is currently residing at 11, Akbar Road.Sources said the new accommodation is in close proximity to Shah’s North Block office and takes care of the leader’s increased security requirements. While the 11, Akbar Road bungalow is spread over 2.3 acres, the Krishna Menon bungalow covers little more than three acres. It has seven bedrooms and two drawing rooms.Officials said the bungalow fell vacant after Vajpayee’s death last August. Vajpayee had moved into the bungalow as a former PM after NDA lost the 2004 election. He stayed there with his foster family for nearly 14 years. The family vacated the bungalow last November.Before Vajpayee, the bungalow was allotted to late Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Murasoli Maran . It was earlier numbered as 8, Krishna Menon Marg. The number was changed officially to 6A when Vajpayee was caretaker PM.The government built a memorial for Vajpayee 'Sadaiv Atal', near the Rashtriya Smriti Sthal. Soon after coming to power in 2014, the government had decided not to convert any government bungalow previously occupied by a leader in Delhi as memorial after death.
