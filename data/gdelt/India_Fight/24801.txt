Sanam Shetty goes deglam for a revenge thriller

Joining the list of actresses who have appeared in deglam avatar on screen is Sanam Shetty . She will be seen in a non-glamorous look for the first time in Arjun Kalaivan ’s untitled project, in which she’s paired with Burma fame Michael Thangadurai . The film, the shooting of which is underway in Chennai, has completed more than 10 days of production, and Sanam avers that she’s had a great experience shooting for it.Sanam says, “The movie is a revenge thriller, with ample suspense elements in it. I play a middle-class girl who is in love with the protagonist, but doesn’t approve of what he does to earn money. The story revolves around the challenges the protagonist faces after a tragedy hits his life. Arjun was Mysskin’s associate, and it is evident from the way he conceives the scenes. He asks me not to go overboard and wants his artistes to react on screen subtly. Usually, my roles demand me to be glamorous, but this one is different.”
