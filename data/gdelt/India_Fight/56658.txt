Shame to have to prove identity in own country

Jhinuk Mazumdar and Subhankar Chowdhury of The Telegraph spoke to some of the protesters

Imran Hasan was on video call for the better part of a protest rally at Esplanade.

It was not a work call. Imran was updating father Mohammad Yusuf Hasan, who was at their home in Kidderpore, about the proceedings.

Yusuf could not step out because of “severe pain in his legs” but wanted to show solidarity with those protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

“He wanted to see how many people had turned up for the meeting,” said Imran, who runs a garments business.

“My father wanted to come but could not because of severe pain in his legs. Before I set out for the rally, he told me I should do a video call so that he could see how many of his Hindu and Muslim brothers are out on the streets protesting.”

The participation of people from all religions in the protest proves that the issue does not concern only a “minority” community.

Imran kept moving his phone around the venue and his father had his eyes glued to his mobile screen.

Imran is the fifth generation of his family to live in India. He feels it would be a shame if his family members, friends or those from his community have to produce documents to prove their identity in their “own country”.

“Muslims and Hindus fought together for Independence and now Muslims have to provide proof that they are Indians. Is this justified? Isn’t it a shame?” he asked.

“The British called us Indians. Years after Independence this government is categorising us as Hindus and Muslims. We stayed here by choice because this is our country, too,” Imran said.
