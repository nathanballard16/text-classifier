The PM was in and out in 45 minutes by 3 pm.” The PM was on a pre-scheduled visit to Uttarakhand that day for multiple events, like the launch of a rescue centre, safari facilities and surveillance systems at Jim Corbett and a rally in Rudrapur. It was on the way from Corbett to Rudrapur around 4 pm that news of the attack first trickled in and Modi was angry about being told late, sources said.From 4-4:45 pm, the PM held review calls to assess the situation, addressed the Rudrapur rally on phone for 5-7 minutes, halted at a rest house in Ramnagar for a review meeting to pass directions and later took the flight back to Delhi from Bareilly.PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti tweeted: “...the PM surely is a pioneer in innovative PR skills...”
