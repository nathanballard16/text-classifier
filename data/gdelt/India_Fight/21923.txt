Carnage in Sri Lanka

The deadly serial bomb blasts that have devastated Sri Lanka pose a huge challenge to those in charge of our safety and security (Editorial, “Sunday, bloody Sunday”, April 23). It is baffling that the island nation did not take warnings about a possible terror attack seriously enough.

It is even more baffling that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister has claimed that he wasn’t ‘informed’ well in advance about the intelligence alert. Perhaps a new worry for Indian intelligence agencies is of countries in the region becoming staging-posts for possible terror strikes on India.

The rest of the world should help Sri Lanka recover from the mass murders. India should go all out to help while also being watchful against terror elements slipping into India. The way New Zealand responded should be a template.

The strikes have also exposed the political fault lines in the island nation. The Sri Lankan President should set aside any lingering tensions, if any, with the Prime Minister and develop a working relationship with him in taking concerted steps to correct the security situation. Simultaneously, the investigation into the blasts should be speeded up, possibly enlisting the help of global agencies.
