Hindus, Muslims to hold peace march ahead of Babri Mosque verdict

SHAFAQNA– Hindu priests and Muslim religious leaders of Rajasthan have held a joint meeting to organize a peace march on November 9, 2019 as India’s Supreme Court begins final hearing about if a Hindu Temple should be built on the ruins of 16th century Babri Mosque in Ayodhya.

Holding the peace march is a joint decision by Jaipur’s Moti Doongari Temple and Muslim organizations including Jamaat-E-Islami Hind. They have called on people from all walks of life, students, politicians, advocates, businessmen, academics, social and religious leaders as well as ordinary people to attend the event. Chief priest of Moti Doongari Temple says it is a stern warning to anti-Indian forces that Muslims and Hindus will remain united in every circumstances.

Secretary of Jamaat-E-Islami Hind also said it is time to win over hatred in society. Members of the Sikh Community have pledged to take part in the rally as they observe the 550th birth anniversary of Sikhs’ religious leader Guru Nanak.

Security is already tight and the government in New Delhi has banned all gatherings in the northern town of Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh state. It is the town where the historic Babri Mosque was demolished by extremist Hindu mobs in 1992. At least 2,000 people mostly Muslims were killed in a spat of violence that swept India after that.

Extremist Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their gods and call for construction of a temple on the ruins of the mosque. The ruling that is going to be announced on November 17, will determine the fate of a 2000 court verdict, which said both Muslims and Hindus should split the site with the bigger share given to Hindus.

There are also news that Muslim artisans have already been deployed to the site for the renovation of the Mosque.
