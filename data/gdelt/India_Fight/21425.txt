Ensured victim is dead

During interrogation, they allegedly confessed to the crime and said that one of their accomplices, who is currently absconding, fired at the victim when he was going towards Khera canal. After making sure that Ravinder is dead, they fled the spot.

To settle scores

The accused allegedly told the police that they killed Ravinder because his brother Sekhar alias Sannata, who is a bad character of the area and currently lodged in jail, had thrashed one of them and they wanted to settle scores.

“It was revealed that Ravinder was arrested by Delhi Police in various offences. Recently, he was released from jail,” Mr Sharma said.
