Keralite man forcibly sent out from flight after resisting security check up

Chennai: A passenger from Kerala was sent out from the flight as he resisted to cooperate for security check up in the flight. It was Alex Mathew, a native of Pathanamthitta, who faced a stringent action from the officials.

The incident occurred on Tuesday evening on an IndiGo flight from Kochi to Bhubaneswar. The flight was landed at Chennai airport in the backdrop of a news of terror attack and a detailed check-up was carried out.
