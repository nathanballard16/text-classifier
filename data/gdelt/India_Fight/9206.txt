The dramatic fall from grace for the man who was once the sixth-richest person in the world

Indian billionaire Anil Ambani has spent years fending off creditors and suing critics of his debt-saddled business empire. But his moment of reckoning may have arrived, as he races to pay debts or face a possible jail sentence.

On February 20, India's Supreme Court said that the Reliance Group's phone unit had disobeyed a ruling to pay about $US77 million owed to the local subsidiary of supplier Ericsson AB, adding that the tycoon will personally face three months of jail unless the payments are made within four weeks. Ambani's group said it will comply with the order and make the payments within the required time.

It's an extraordinary fall for a man listed by Forbes magazine in 2008 as the world's sixth-wealthiest person. The court's decision comes after a tough year for Ambani, as parts of his empire saw losses and competition in India's telecommunications market became increasingly brutal. His story also offers insights into how far India has come in cracking down on overdue borrowers and curbing the financial impunity of its richest citizens.

"He has reached the final weeks of the battle," said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, a Mumbai-based investment advisory firm. Ambani can fight with Ericsson and other creditors but can't do that with the nation's top court, he said.
