Unnao rape survivor to be shifted to Delhi today

Lucknow, Aug 5 : The Unnao rape survivor will be airlifted to Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Monday evening.

According to official sources, the rape survivor will be taken to Delhi at 6.30 p.m. through a green traffic corridor created for her transportation from the Trauma Centre to the Amausi airport. A team of doctors is also expected to accompany her to Delhi.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court ordered that the girl, who was critically injured in a car crash in Rae Bareli on July 28, be shifted to Delhi for treatment.

The medical bulletin issued by the King George's Medical University on Monday afternoon reported a slight improvement in her condition though she is still on ventilator.

The survivor's mother had earlier opted for continuing treatment in Lucknow but her lawyers, on Monday, told the Supreme Court that they wanted her to be shifted to Delhi.

The court said that if the family of the lawyer, who was also seriously injured in the accident, wanted he would also be shifted to Delhi. The lawyer has been taken off the ventilator but is still in deep coma.
