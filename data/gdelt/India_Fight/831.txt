Man arrested for killing brother-in-law 9 months ago

Cuttack: With the arrest of a 30-year-old man from Kolkata, Bidanasi police here Sunday claimed to have blown the lid off a nine-month-old murder case over a land dispute at Tulasipur Hartigada here.

“Basanta Guru alias Muna has been arrested from the neighbouring state on charges of killing his brother-in-law Bulu Biswal over suspected land dispute in April last year,” Bidanasi IIC Pradeep Rout said, adding that they have seized a blood-stained dagger from his possession.

Muna was on the run since the incident, Rout added.

According to sources, Muna was residing in a thatched house in Hatigada area which he had built on a government land. Later, he invited two of his brother-in-laws—Bulu and Sk Raja—to stay at his place. “However, things went off track after a few months following which Bulu and Sk Raja were forced to leave the place. Within months, Raja built a house next to Muna’s before relocating there. However, this did not go well with Muna, who time and again picked up quarrel with Raja,” a senior police official said.

Muna’s rough behaviour with his brother-in-law – Raja – irked Bulu and he tried to settle the issue, though unsuccessfully. “Muna often warned Bulu to stay out of the issue, but to a precious little. It was April 23 when an infuriated Muna hacked Bulu to death before fleeing the state. A profusely bleeding Bulu was rushed to SCB Medical College and Hospital. But he was declared ‘dead on arrival’,” the official said referring to the police complaint.

Soon after, Bulu’s family approached Purighat police which registered a case (39/18) under Sections 302 and other relevant Sections of the IPC, the official added.

During investigations, police traced Muna’s location to Kolkata following which a team of Bidanasi police, led by IIC Pradeep Rout, raided his possible hideouts before taking him into custody, it was learnt.
