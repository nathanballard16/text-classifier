Man in TN attacked for posting pic of himself having beef

A Muslim man was allegedly attacked by a group of people at a village near here for uploading a picture of himself consuming beef soup, police said Friday.

Four people have been arrested in this connection, police added.

The CPI(M) state unit condemned the incident and called for stringent action against the accused.

Mohammed Faisan (24) of Poravachery had posted the picture on Facebook Thursday and also described its taste.

The group of people objected to the post and went to Faisan's house Thursday night and questioned him, police said.

After a quarrel, they attacked him, police said.

Faisan was injured and admitted to the government hospital here.

On the orders of District Superintendent of Police T K Rajasekaran, police registered a case and arrested four people Friday -- Dinesh Kumar (28), Agathian (29), Ganeshkumar (27) and Mohankumar (28).

Police have registered cases against him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including attempt to murder.

Meanwhile, the CPI(M) Tamil Nadu unit condemned the attack on Faizan and said while such attacks were happening on Dalits and Muslims in north India, "the state government and police should nip such episodes in the bud" in Tamil Nadu.

"Those behind the murderous attack should be given stringent punishment," the party's state unit Secretary K Balakrishnan said in a statement in Chennai.
