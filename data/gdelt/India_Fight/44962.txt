Rajnath Singh tells Pakistan to mend its ways

JAIPUR: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said if Pakistan were to repeat its mistake of 1971, the neighbouring country would disintegrate.“Pakistan broke up in 1971 – Pakistan and Bangladesh were formed. If Islamabad repeats its mistake of 1971 (of waging war), there is no saying as to what will happen to Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK),’’ said Singh while addressing the 103 birth anniversary celebrations of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya at the memorial in Dhankya of Jaipur district.“India has not accepted PoK as the official status of the disputed land. It is an encroachment by Pakistan, which is why we have left 24 seats vacant in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly,’’ said Singh. The defence minister claimed that scrapping of Article 370 had not gone well with Pakistan. He said India had taken great precaution and did not attack Pakistan, its army or citizens while carrying out strikes on a terror camp in Balakot after Pulwama attack. “Things might change if it does not mend its ways,’’ he added. Calling Upadhyaya a pillar of ideologies, Singh said Pandit Deendayal had given the Indian politics a new direction.
