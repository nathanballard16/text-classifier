India once welcomed Muslims like me. Under Modi, it rejects us as invaders.

As the lynchings of Muslims began in 2015, during Modi’s first term in office, it struck me that the prime minister always remained eerily quiet in response to the violence. As long as the mob remained on the streets, the government could maintain the impression that it did not bear culpability for these supposedly isolated incidents. Since Modi’s landslide reelection in May, however, the BJP has had a mandate to fulfill its promise of a Hindu nation, an ideological project that dates back a century. The BJP has delivered: In August, for example, Parliament imposed direct control on the Muslim-majority province of Kashmir, denying journalists access, imprisoning elected officials and halting citizens’ communications in what has become the longest Internet shutdown ever in a democracy. In November, India’s Supreme Court ruled to allow the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, on the site of a former Mughal-era mosque that, decades earlier, was destroyed by a Hindu mob.
