Assam Police bust international cattle smuggling racket, arrest 16

GUWAHATI: Busting an international cattle smuggling racket, Assam police on Wednesday nabbed at least 16 cattle smugglers in separate operations. All of them were held during multiple number of raids launched in Guwahati, Dhubri and South Salmara districts of the state bordering Bangladesh.The operations were launched following chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal's direction to Assam Police chief Kuladhr Saikia to take action against illegal syndicates in the state.Raunak Ali Hazarika, Assam Police's Deputy Inspector General (Western Range), told TOI, "In the joint operation of Dhubri and South Salmara-Mankachar Police, several pre-dawn raids were conducted at various locations of both the districts simultaneously against known cattle smugglers and their associates. During the operation, 12 known cattle smugglers were apprehended and at least 13 cattleheads and some iron fence cutting tools were seized."Amongst the arrestees, at least three were from Dhubri and the rest from South Salmara district.The recovery of the iron fence cutting tools from the cattle smugglers' possession indicated the latest modus operandi of these smugglers. "They (cattle smugglers) have admitted to using these tools to cut the barbwires in the international borders to push their cattle to the other side," said a police source. He added that these smugglers were waiting for rainy nights to smuggle the cattle.Meanwhile, city police, too, nabbed at least four cattle smugglers in a separate operation. From digging tunnels under the border fences to pushing the cattle through riverine areas, the smugglers are known for adopting various methods. The international cattle smuggling rackets were found to have gone hyperactive recently with the growing demand in Bangladesh during the Ramzan festivities.Earlier, some 12 cattle smugglers were apprehended and some 138 cattleheads seized by the BSF in separate operations in May.On Wednesday, during the Director General level meeting of the BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at Dhaka in Bangladesh, the issue of smuggling of cattle was discussed. Both the countries sought each other's cooperation to check cross border cattle smuggling.
