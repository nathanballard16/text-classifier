‘Alliances are formed based on changing political situation’

DMK has no right to talk of coalition dharma, says Anbalagan

Responding to DMK president M. K. Stalin's statement that All India N. R. Congress and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have entered into an unholy alliance, AIADMK leader A. Anbalagan on Friday said alliances are formed based on the changing political situation of a particular time.

Talking to reporters during his campaign for AINRC candidate K. Narayanasamy, he said the present situation warranted an alliance between the principal Opposition party and the AIADMK. The DMK, he said, has no rights to talk about coalition dharma as his alliance partners — Congress and Communist Party of India ( Marxist) — are adopting double standards.

The Congress and the CPI(M) are engaged in a fierce battle in Kerala while they are partners in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Even the Congress president was fielded against CPI(M) in Wayanad. There are a good number of Tamil people living in Waynad. The DMK should state whether the party cadre would vote for the Congress or the CPI(M) in Kerala, he said.

Heavy loss

He said the Congress would lose heavily in the U.T. because of the non performance of the government headed by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy.

The Congress was not able to highlight any of its achievements during campaigning, he said.

Predicting a change of guard in the Union Territory within three months, he said the AIADMK will be part of the ministry formed after the Lok Sabha polls.
