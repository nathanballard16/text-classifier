Maharashtra: Narendra Dabholkar's successor decries 'government apathy' in probing murders

MUMBAI: On Tuesday, Avinash Patil, successor of the late Dr Narendra Dabholkar , lamented "apathy" shown by both the state and central governments in probing the killings of the slain rationalist as well as other murdered activists, including politician Govind Pansare, journalist Gauri Lankesh and scholar M M Kalburgi."There is a glaring lack of political will in investigating these murders," said Patil, executive president of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS), a rationalist organization founded by Dabholkar, who was killed in Pune in 2013."In the past five years, we met the CM (chief minister of Maharashtra) 25 times and sent him several written requests but nothing came of it. The mastermind has not yet been arrested," said Patil and added he suspected that the founder of Sanatan Sanstha could be the mastermind.Patil was speaking at a press conference held to announce a day-long international conference that will mark the 30th anniversary of MANS. To be held at Mulund's Kalidasa Natyamandir on August 9, this conference will see the likes of Bob Churchill, director of London's Humanist International, film director Jabbar Patel among other eminent names holding forth on "rationalism for the development of humanity".Patil said Maharashtra's Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act of 2013 was referred by Uganda in its anti-superstition efforts.
