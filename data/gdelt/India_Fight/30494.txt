The video of the incident has gone viral showing the city cops publicly thrashing auto drivers in Mukherjee Nagar area.

Condemning the incident, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal termed it 'brutal' and 'unfortunate' and demanded impartial probe with strict action against the guilty.

"Delhi Police brutality in Mukherjee Nagar is highly condemnable and unjustified. I demand an impartial probe into the whole incident & strict action against the guilty. Protectors of citizens can't be allowed to turn into uncontrolled violent mobsters," Kejriwal tweeted.

Meanwhile, Police said an enquiry will be conducted by Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya and additional DCP and ACP of the district.

Kejriwal also visited the victim's house here in Gandhi Nagar on Monday and condemned the incident.
