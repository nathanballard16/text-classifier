Shaurya Chakra awardee gets hero’s welcome at Chhota Udepur village

VADODARA: Rifleman Lilesh Rathwa had to work in dolomite factory for nights so that he could finance his school education at Lehvant village in Chhota Udepur. But after years of struggle, Rathwa received a hero’s welcome at Chhota Udepur railway station on Wednesday morning.Hundreds of people, who are in no way related to Rathwa, turned up at the railway station to congratulate the Army man for his achievements. After welcoming Rathwa with garlands at the railway station, many people walked streets of Chhota Udepur town by lifting him on their shoulders.Last month, President Ramnath Kovind awarded the prestigious Shaurya Chakra medal to Rathwa at the Rashtrapati Bhavan for gunning down two terrorists at the Myanmar border in Manipur . In November 2017, when Rathwa and 20 other soldiers of the 4th battalion of Assam Rifles were clearing a road they encountered a group of terrorists.“The terrorists sprayed bullets towards us, injuring two of our soldiers. I picked up my friend’s light machine gun and started firing. Two terrorists were killed by my firing following which others retreated,” Rathwa told TOI. Recognizing his display of bravery, Rathwa’s name was recommended for the medal.Being the first person from his village to join the Indian Army, Rathwa has now been selected in the elite Black Commando group following an exam and training in Manesar. After completing seven months of training, Rathwa returned home. “The idea of serving the country and making a name for my village and Chhota Udepur motivated me to join the Army,” said Rathwa. He joined the Army in 2008, at the age of 18.
