Chandigarh, Jan 20 (PTI) A head constable of Punjab Police was arrested for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000, an official spokesperson said Sunday.

The complainant had approached the vigilance bureau and informed that he came into contact with a woman through social media, who called him at a flat of her associate at Guru Gobind Singh Avenue, Jalandhar on December 29 last year.

He claimed, in a pre-planned move, her associate head constable Raja Singh raided that flat and threatened him to register a case under the Immoral Traffic Act.

The spokesperson said the woman was also forcing the complainant to deliver the promised amount to the police official.

After verifying his information, the vigilance team laid a trap and the accused was arrested on the spot for taking a bribe of Rs 50,000 as a first installment from the complainant in the presence of two official witnesses.

He informed that a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against the accused and his two women associates at the VB police station Jalandhar and said further investigation was underway. PTI CHS KJ
