After the Balakot Air Strike Terrorist is in Terror, Now Created Its New Base in this place

Kabul: Terrorists have started changing their positions since the Indian Air Force airstrike in Balakot. Media reports claim that Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba militants have joined hands with organizations such as the Haqqan network in Afghanistan and the Afghan Taliban. The Indian Air Force's action in Balakot, bordering India, is said to have led to the terror attack. They are looking for a safe haven for themselves.

Sources said that with the help of organizations like Haqqani and Taliban, Lashkar and Jaish are trying to build their base in Kandahar and Kunar areas bordering Afghanistan. The Indian Air Force had entered Balakot on February 14 this year after the Jaish militants in the CIAF camp in Pulwama carried out a major attack with the help of a suicide bomber.
