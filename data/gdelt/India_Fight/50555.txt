Cops catch up with double murder convict after 20 yrs

Ludhiana: After hiding for 20 years, a man convicted in a 1993 double murder case of Raikot was finally arrested by CIA-2 on Wednesday. And during these years, the convict — Raj Kumar Joshi — got married and now has two children.

Joshi, now 50, was declared a proclaimed offender (PO) in the murder case in 2017. He lived in Jamalpur area for these many years. He also started his business as a property dealer.

Inspector Parveen Randev, in-charge, CIA-2, said in 1993, during terrorism days in Punjab, the accused had killed two of his friends — Manjinder Singh and Jagdeep Singh — of village as they were Sikhs. The duo used to tease and harass him for being a Hindu and he had stabbed them to death on March 24, 1993, as revenge, the cop said. The accused was 24 years old at the time of crime.

The inspector said Joshi was arrested and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Ludhiana sessions judge on September 9, 1996.

Assistant commissioner of police (detective) Surinder Mohan said in 1999, Joshi got bail from Punjab and Haryana High court. That year, he also filed a criminal appeal in the high court, challenging his sentence. However, in May 25, 2005, his application was dismissed.

Thereafter on May 8, 2017, the Ludhiana court declared him a proclaimed offender in this double murder case.

ACP Mohan said Joshi had been hiding since 1999. He got married and started living in Jamalpur area where he started his business, the official added.

Acting on a tip-off, the CIA arrested Joshi from Tajpur Road.
