Chennai air pollution: Intense smoke, stench an everyday affair near this dump yard

By Express News ServiceCHENNAI: With tears running down her cheeks and coughing incessantly, nine-year-old K Mary rushes back into her cramped little house in Ezhil Nagar. According to the data, on November 9, the Air Quality Index (AQI) at Ezhil Nagar spiked to 935 µg/m3 from 4 am - 5 am. The National Ambient Air Quality (NAAQ) standard is 60 µg/m3. Between November 3 and 9, when Chennai was battling the infamous smog, Ezhil Nagar too was marinating in toxic air. Even on the days, when the average air quality seemed to relatively improve, there were short but intense spikes of very poor air quality owing to incidents of garbage burning.
