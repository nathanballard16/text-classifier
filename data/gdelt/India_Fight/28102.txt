WATCH: Rafale replica placed outside Air Chief Marshal's residence in Delhi across Congress HQ

: A replica of the Rafale fighter aircraft was erected outside the official residence of Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa by the Indian Air Force onFriday. The Rafale replica, which replaced a Sukhoi SU-30 model, is attracting huge attention as it has come up right across from the Congress headquarters at 24, Akbar Road. The Air Chief's official residence is 23, Akbar Road, which is just opposite the main hub of the Congress party. The Congress had made the Rafale deal one of its main election issues. The purchase of the Rafale fighter aircrafts by the BJP-led NDA government had erupted into a big political controversy with the opposition, especially Congress President Rahul Gandhi, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of influencing the deal. It is said that the replica is of a fully loaded Rafale model with Meteor & Mica missiles besides prcision-bombs.
