Lucknow: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday conducted raids at several locations in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in connection with the UP illegal mining scam. The searches were carried out at Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Hamirpur and Jalaun.

The development could cause trouble for Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav as the scam took place during the period when he was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.

Sources said the CBI also conducted raids at the premises of IAS officer and former Hamirpur District Magistrate Chandrakala. The CBI, which had earlier registered a preliminary enquiry in the UP illegal mining scam case, has now filed a case.

The probe into the matter was given by the state High Court.

ANI quoted CBI sources as saying: "Searches conducted at 14 places in Jalao, Hamirpur, Noida, Lucknow and Kanpur. 11 people including government officials involved. For a limited period, there was a ban; however the government officials allowed mining even during the ban period."
