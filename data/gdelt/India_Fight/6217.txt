To fight terrorism, India has been hiking its military funding over the years. Amid tension with neighbouring countries, India has stepped up its military spending by nearly 54 percent in a 10-year span aiming to be at par with other nations' defence power.

In Union Budget 2019, the government set aside an outlay of Rs 3 lakh crore for the defence budget of fiscal FY20, which is an increase of just 1.67 percent over last year's allocation of Rs 2.95 lakh crore. Out of the total allocation, Rs 1.03 lakh crore has been pegged for capital outlay, which includes expenditure on modernisation of the three forces, purchase of new weapons, aircraft, warships and other military hardware.

Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack in Pulwama. The Indian government accused Pakistan of letting militant groups operate from its soil and called on it to take action. Islamabad, however, has rejected the suggestion that it was linked to the attack.
