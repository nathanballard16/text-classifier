Doval orders shifting of injured baby girl to AIIMS

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR, Sep 7: NSA Ajit Doval on Saturday ordered the shifting of two and a half-year-old girl Asma Jaan, who sustained injuries in yesterday's militant attack in Sopore town, to AIIMS in New Delhi.

Doval asked the concerned authorities to bring Asma to AIIMS in Delhi for better medical care, after he learned about her critical condition.

Earlier in the day, Srinagar District Magistrate and Development Commissioner Shahid Choudhary had tweeted that Asma would be shifted to Delhi in an air ambulance for advanced medical aid.

“Baby Asma of 30 months is among the injured in a militant attack on fruits merchants in Sopore. She didn't deserve this. We've put in all efforts to get an air ambulance ASAP to take her Delhi for advanced medical attention,” Srinagar District Magistrate and Development Commissioner Shahid Choudhary said in a tweet.

He also urged people to pray for the speedy recovery of the child. All the injured have been shifted to the hospital for medical aid and are said to be stable at the moment, Jammu and Kashmir police had said. Terming it a 'merciless act of terrorism', they said that a team reached the place of attack and a probe was initiated.

Asma is among four injured who were attacked by terrorists in Dangerpora area of Sopore district on Friday.
