Rae Bareli Congress MLA Aditi Singh injured in road accident, she alleges attack by opponents

Congress MLA from Rae Bareli, Aditi Singh, was injured as her vehicle overturned in Harchandpur area on Tuesday afternoon, police said.

Aditi Singh was on her way to oversee voting for a no-confidence motion against Zila Panchayat chairman Avdhesh Pratap Singh when the incident took place, they said.

The Congress MLA alleged that Avdhesh Pratap Singh's henchmen, armed with iron rods and bricks, attacked her vehicle due to which the driver lost control and it overturned.

"Attack was done on Awadesh Singh's direction near his brother Dinesh Singh's college. Awadesh Singh was also present," she said.

Dinesh Singh is the BJP's candidate for Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat -- a traditional stronghold of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

Her father Akhilesh Singh, a local strongman and former MLA, alleged that that the district administration was working under pressure from the ruling BJP. Samajwadi Party's Unchahar MLA Manoj Pandey also arrived with his supporters and raised slogans against the government.

Aditi Singh also joined the protesters from different opposition parties.

The floor test was deferred because the MLA and zila panchayat members couldn't reach the district panchayat office in time after the alleged attack.

Following the attack, a few Zila Panchayat members have gone missing and are yet to be found.

Commenting on the matter, SK Bhagat, IG, Lucknow range, said, "Zila Panchayat members have alleged that a few members are missing. Necessary action will be taken. Force was allotted where voting was to take place. We'll take a report."
