One member from every family should join armed forces: TMC MP

Senior TMC leader and MP Abhishek Banerjee here on Tuesday called for a legislation to ensure that one member from every household joins the armed forces.

"Is it time to bring about a law in Parliament so that every home in India takes pride in having a representative in the armed forces" Banerjee said in a tweet in the wake of the Pulwama terror attacks.

"Is it time for even elected MPs and MLAs to nurture and inspire their children and grand children and commit them to join the armed forces?," he said.

Banerjee, nephew of Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, also said there is need for bullet-proof jackets for jawans.

"Our jawans keep our borders safe. They sacrifice their lives to keep us safe. Before bullet trains, we need bullet-proof jackets for jawans. Today is the time, more than ever, to stand by them," he wrote on his Twitter handle.

Banerjee also said he will donate three months' salary as MP for the cause and proposed to set up a corpus to raise awareness among youth.
