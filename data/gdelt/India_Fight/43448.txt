Sharma, one of the Mumbai police officers who were famous for killing gangsters in encounters, resigned from the police force in July.

He held the rank of senior inspector then.

According to sources, he may get ticket from the Sena for the assembly polls.

He joined the Sena in presence of party president Uddhav Thackeray, who tied 'Shiv Bandhan' on his wrist.

Sena leaders sport 'Shiv Bandhan', a thread, on their wrists to indicate loyalty to the party.

Sharma said he was always inspired by late Bal Thackeray, the Sena's founder.

"I am getting a good platform to do good work," he said.
