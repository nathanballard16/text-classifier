Queen visits borough for Legion centenary

THE Queen marked the 100th anniversary of the Royal British Legion [RBL] with a visit to the borough ahead of Remembrance Day.

She attended the opening of the latest development at the RBL Centenary Village near Aylesford on November 6.

While she was there, she met a 99-year-old veteran of World War Two, John Riggs, and told him: “I must remember to get your card on the right date next year.”

The village provides accommodation for armed forces personnel and their families, including those with disabilities.

The £22million project, which began in 2015, is designed to support ex-servicemen and women who are in need for another 100 years.

Mr Riggs, served in Burma with the Chindits, a renowned special operations unit formed to carry out long-range penetration raids to protect India from Japanese invasion.

His daughter Barbara Rajkumar said: “He served extensively in the Middle East and was behind enemy lines in Burma.“He came out of the jungle weighing seven-and-a-half stone.”

Mr Riggs, who was also at the Siege of Tobruk and attained the rank of captain, has been living in the RBL’s accommodation for more than 50 years.
