We stopped the shoot immediately and called in doctor, he was really in a lot of pain and painkillers were given to him," director Ken Ghosh said in a statement.

The director said that the crew had decided to cancel the shoot for the day.

"He took an hour in his van just sort of rest and then called me because we had planned to move ahead and reschedule the entire shoot. He said 'No don't, I will come back and finish the shoot'. After about an hour or two's break he came back on the set and finished the shoot for the day, which is actually sweet of him to do. I wouldn't have done that," he added.
