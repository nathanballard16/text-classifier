Closed Since February, Pakistan Opens Airspace For Civil Traffic - Report

"With immediate effect Pakistan airspace is open for all type of civil traffic on published ATS (Air Traffic Service) routes," a Notice to Airmen (NOTAMS) read, cited by Reuters.

Earlier in the day, the Indian news agency PTI, citing sources, reported that a ban on Indian flights, that had not been allowed to use a majority of Pakistani airspace since the Balakot air strikes in February, had been removed.

"Pakistan has permitted all airlines to fly through its airspace from around 12:41 am today. Indian airline operators will start using normal routes through Pakistan airspace soon," an undisclosed source told PTI.
