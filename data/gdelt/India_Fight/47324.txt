Gandhi’s ‘Hey Ram’ was different from today’s ‘Jai Shri Ram’

New Delhi: Though the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was a supporter of cow protection, he was opposed to killing a human being in the name of cow protection. This was asserted by young writers who arrived from every corner of the country to attend the two-day Youth Writers Conference held to commemorate Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary in Delhi on Saturday.

They also claimed that ‘there is a lot of difference between Gandhiji’s ‘Hey Ram’ and ‘Jai Shri Ram’’. The writers told that Gandhi Ji was very much concerned about the minority community, whether they were Muslims of India or Hindus of Pakistan and he never favoured anyone on the basis of religion.

Raza Foundation organised the conference which was participated by about 50 authors. Books written by Gandhi was discussed at the conference.

According to the News Track, while blaming Gandhi for the partition of India the participants of the conference condemned the efforts to forget Gandhi as soon as India got independence.

The writers lamented that the country had not yet got the real freedom for which Gandhiji was martyred.
