Janhvi Kapoor says Pankaj Tripathi thinks 'I am a creep'; find out why

Janhvi Kapoor has kickstarted the shoot of her second film a few weeks back. The film is a biopic on Indian Air Force combat pilot Gunjan Saxena and Janhvi started prepping for the film from a very long time. In the film, the stunning beauty will be seen alongside Pankaj Tripathi, who is playing the role of her onscreen father. The movie also stars Angad Bedi as Janhvi's onscreen brother.

On the talk show Feet up with the Stars, Janhvi was all praises for Pankaj and even shared a funny anecdote from the sets of their film. She stated to the host Anaita Shroff Adajania about how Pankaj compared acting as cooking mutton. Janhvi spoke about what happened after she joined the conversation. The actor stated, "Sir, par aap toh ice cream ho, aap sabko pasand ho (You are like ice cream. Everyone likes you). Right after I said it, he gave me a look."

The Dhadak actor added, "He probably thinks I am a creep, but yes I feel he is a legendary actor and there is no one like Pankaj sir. I couldn’t hold back and immediately expressed my fondness for him."

We can't wait to see the onscreen camaraderie between Janhvi and Pankaj in the film!

Gunjan Saxena biopic is being directed by Sharan Sharma and co-produced by Karan Johar under his home banner Dharma Productions. The movie also marks the debut of another star kid Shanaya Kapoor but as the assistant director. The movie is being shot in Lucknow.
