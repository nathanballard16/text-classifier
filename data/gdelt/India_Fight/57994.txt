Gujarat HC upholds death sentence for rape-murder of 3.5-year-old

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Friday confirmed the trial court’s sentence of death by hanging awarded to Anil Yadav, 22, for the rape and murder of a three-and-a-half yearold girl in Surat, “considering the rising crime rate against young girls and in response to society’s cry for justice”.In July, a trial court in Surat had awarded the death sentence to Yadav for abducting, raping, and killing the child in October last year, classifying it as a ‘rarest of rare’ crime. On Friday, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice A C Rao concurred with the trial court’s judgement, rejected Yadav’s appeal against his conviction, and approved the state government’s demand for capital punishment, “to have deterrence in society”.Explaining why it considered Yadav’s crime rarest of rare, the HC said, “The abhorrent and atrocious nature of crime committed by the appellant/accused in a diabolical manner, on the defenseless unprotected girl , without any remorse, has left the court with no option but to consider the case ‘rarest of rare case’ for awarding the punishment of death penalty.” The HC further said, “Such crimes do not only reflect the abusive facet of human conduct but also shock conscience of the society.”
