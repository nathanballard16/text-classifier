When it comes to one couple from the Southern film industry who take us by a surprise with their adorableness are undoubtedly Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar. Whether it's their social media PDA or just being too cute, Mahesh and Namrata are adorable. As per various reports, it was love at first sight for the two of them but they ensured to keep mum about their relationship. Instead of telling his parents, Mahesh confided about his relationship with his sister. With Namrata being four years older, the duo eventually tied the knot in 2005 after a five-year courtship.

Namrata gave up on her Bollywood career and has stood by her bae throughout his career.
