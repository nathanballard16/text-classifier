Retarded Pak woman dies after being shot by BSF

NAROWAL: A 22-year-old Pakistani woman who was shot by the Indian Border Security Force personnel died at a hospital in Amritsar, media reports said on Saturday.

Gulshan Bibi, suffering from a psychological disorder, was the resident of Narowal. She mistakenly crossed the Pakistan-India border and was killed by the Indian armed forces which declared her a terrorist.

Indian media outlets quoted their army as saying she was mentally fit. The BSF took her to the Guru Nanak Civil Hospital where she succumbed to her wounds.

Gulshan Bibi's family has appealed to Prime Minister Imran Khan to have her body returned to Pakistan. Her uncle told a private television channel on Saturday that she had left their house at night three days ago and crossed the border near a check-post. He asked the premier for help in bringing the body back so her funeral rites could take place.
