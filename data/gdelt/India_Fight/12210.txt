India now in list of nations that avenge soldiers’ deaths: Shah

AHMEDABAD: BJP national president Amit Shah said here on Sunday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shown the will to act against terror attacks and avenge the deaths of Indian soldiers. He also attacked the opposition for seeking proof of the results of the IAF air strike on a terror facility in Balakot , Pakistan.“Earlier, there were two countries known to avenge their soldiers’ deaths — the US and Israel. After the two incidents (Uri and Pulwama ), Narendrabhai (PM Modi) has added India’s name on that list. It’s a matter of pride for our nation, its security and the commitment towards the sacrifice made by our jawans,” Shah said at the inauguration of a building constructed by Jain International Trade Organisation (JITO) to be used as a hostel for 150 Jain students.Speaking at the function at the Gujarat University convention centre, Shah said Indian jawans had been attacked and “humiliated” periodically. “In the last five years, two major incidents — Uri and Pulwama — took place. After Uri, our Indian Army carried out a surgical strike. Citizens were saying that a surgical strike after the Pulwama attack was not an option due to the alertness (across the border). But Narendra Modi’s government carried out an air strike on the 13th day and crushed over 250 terrorists without inflicting any casualty on itself,” he asserted.Referring to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s return from Pakistan within 60 hours of his capture, Shah attributed this to the impact of the Modi government and said it was the quickest return of a “yuddh kaidi”, or prisoner of war, across the world.Attacking the opposition for questioning the Indian Air Force, Shah said they should be ashamed of calling themselves Indian citizens. “Those demanding proof are helping Pakistan,” he said, adding that politics should not stoop to such low levels as politicising issues of national security.
