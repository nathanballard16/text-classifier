Celebrating Kannada Cinema As Sandalwood Bags 13 National Awards: In Conversation With Director Rishab Shetty

“Every time there was a successful film, it kind of spoiled the scene for the next few years because people started replicating and trying to repeat. Om became a cult film for instance in 1995, and till date, there are many who haven’t yet gotten over its hangover,” says Shetty.

“Mungaru Maley, Or Duniya or even Kirik Party — one good film is being taken as a formula and then they bore the audiences with that mould. But you need to break the monotony, go beyond it and try anew; which these films that have won awards have done,” he explains.

Language too has been a defining factor as most of these films have explored a different variety of Kannada, have set the stories in regions beyond Bangalore, and have popularised it with ease.

This was not the scene earlier; regional variations, be they of culture or language, were only used to add comic relief and even that would not be done correctly.

“ That was what was missing in Kannada – they stopped exploring cultures. And even when they did, only certain cultural traits would be distorted and portrayed for comic relief. For instance, the way Mangaluru Kannada was portrayed. No one speaks like that in Mangaluru,” says Shetty, who hails from Kundapura on the coast of Karnataka.

Comparing it to Tamil and Malayalam films, which unlike Kannada films, didn’t shy away form exploring sub-cultures, Shetty opines that it is this in-depth and honest portrayal of cultural nuances is what changed the cinematic fabric of Kannada films today.
