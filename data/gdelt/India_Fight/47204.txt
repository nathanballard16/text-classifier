Fugitive crime kingpin Zeesan released on bail in Dubai!

Top fugitive criminal Zeesan Ahmed, wanted by DMP in murder and explosives cases, who was arrested in the UAE recently, had reportedly been freed on bail by a Dubai court on Thursday.

A source said an influential person of the UAE signed his bail bond. But Zeesan is not allowed to leave Dubai.

Earlier, Zeesan alias Zeesan Ahmed alias Ali Akbar Chowdhury was arrested in Dubai. The news of Zeesan’s arrest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) surfaced on October 4, four days after his arrest.

Zeesan alias Monty was named in the home ministry's list of 'top criminals' in 2009 along with a reward for his arrest.

He terrorised businessmen in Dhaka's Motijheel, Malibagh, Badda, Gulshan and Banani between the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was also notorious for extortion and tender-grabbing.

In May, 2003, two officers of the Detective Branch of Police were killed in a drive to arrest him from a hotel in Malibagh. The incident caused a stir across the country.

Later, Zeesan went into hiding and fled to India, from where, it is believed he went to Dubai.
