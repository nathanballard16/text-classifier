Boeing to Bid for Indian Helicopter Deal

Boeing is set to bid for India’s helicopter acquisition programme for 22 combat and 15 heavy-lift helicopters.

As part of the deal, the defence firm plans to offer India the C-17 Globemaster III, which can carry large equipment, supplies and troops directly to small airfields.

Boeing Integrated Defense Systems India head Vivek Lall said that the C-17 fits in well with India’s operational requirements.

Proposals for the combat helicopters are due on 22 September 2009 while deadline for the heavy-lift helicopters is 23 September.
