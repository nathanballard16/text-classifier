Opinion : I am an Indian liberal. Here’s what we are doing wrong.

Of course, the fact that many liberals have buried their heads in the sands of denial does not justify the vitriol that the right wing, and sometimes even the Modi government, directs at us. Many of us have suffered from this vitriol personally — especially women. It could be armies of trolls deployed to spread fake news about us online, or it could be more insidious: There are journalists in India, such as myself, who have been informally blacklisted by the government for criticizing it over the years. The irony is that we are attacked with as much ferocity by commentators on the left when we call out the flaws in their positions.
