Chennai: Drunk kills friend, shares photo of body on WhatsApp

Chennai: A 32-year-old man, who allegedly murdered his friend in a drunken brawl and shared the photograph of the dead body on a WhatsApp group, was arrested by the city police from his hideout in Puducherry on Friday.

The residents of the Army quarters in Nadambakkam on Thursday night messaged the police on Whatsapp about their suspicion that a man could be have been murdered and buried inside the bushy empty land in their locality.

The police reached the spot and in the presence of the Tahsildar, dug out the body of the man. He was later identified as Subesh(37), a resident of Nandambakkam and a history-sheeter with a murder case and many burglary cases against him.

Quoting the residents, the police officer said that although mostly only youngsters would frequent the empty land to smoke marijuana and consume alcohol, on Wednesday night, a few men with shovels were seen entering the bushes. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Subesh, along with five other friends, had gone to drink alcohol inside the bushes and resolve some internal disagreements. "While drinking, his friends Anandan and Karthik attacked Subesh on his head with the beer bottles and murdered him. Anandan happened to take a picture of the dead body and later shared it on a Whatsapp Group," said the police officer. The Nandambakkam police then initiated a search for the accused and nabbed Anandan(32), an electrician from Puducherry, and detained him. "We are actively searching for Karthik and the rest. Anandan will be remanded in Judicial custody on Saturday," the police officer said.
