Hrithik Roshan hurt by media for giving attention to a 'lying' Kangana Ranaut

Hrithik Roshan and Kangana Ranaut's controversy will never cease to exist. In these past few years, Kangana has spoken about the controversies which grabbed many eyeballs, however, Hrithik has kept his mum in the matter at several instances. During the Super 30 promotions, when Hrithik was asked about it, he had stated, "I have come to realize that bullies have to be treated with a certain amount of patience and not engaged with. It's upon the civil society and those who claim to be just and fair to see and observe if there is harassment."

Now, at a recently held Hindustan Times Mint Asia Leadership Summit in Singapore, Hrithik was once again asked about Kangana, to which he replied, "What hurt me was that media gave attention to the audacity with which that certain person was indulging in lying and deceit."

While earlier also the Kaabil actor has spoken on the similar lines about the controversy. He had said, "I have learnt not to get affected by either judgement. Although to be honest, my only grouse is with those supposed enlightened people who are praising and often cheering this behaviour on the name of "new" and "refreshing audacity" without any desire to be rational or truthful. They are the enablers who have allowed this circus to continue for 6 years."

He added, "There is no legal case that I have directly with the lady, and the reason why I cannot have one is because a guy cannot be stalked in India."

Meanwhile, on the work front, Hrithik is gearing up for the release of his upcoming film, War.
