GUWAHATI: The BJP-led Tripura government barred a delegation of North East Students’ Organization (NESO) on Friday from meeting its members, who were injured in a police firing during Tuesday’s bandh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016.NESO will observe Black Day in Tripura across the region on Saturday to protest against Tripura government’s move to fire on peaceful protesters.NESO is an umbrella organisation of students’ bodies of Northeast India. Five persons received bullet injuries during the bandh while several others were injured.It is alleged that security forces attacked the ambulance, which was carrying the injured to the hospital.NESO adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya said since Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb is of foreign origin, he cannot understand the pain of indigenous people.He said, “Tripura government prevented a delegation of the students’ body to visit Khunglung area of Tripura where four youths, who received bullet injuries during a clash with police on January 8 while protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, were admitted. One person was rushed to a hospital in Kolkata. Police told us that they cannot allow us to go to there since Section 144 Cr. PC was in force. We even asked them to accompany us to the hospital but still they did not allow. We had not gone there to create problems but to meet the injured students.”
