A Mid Day report quoted celebrity trainer Namrata Purohit as saying that she worked with Janhvi to help her look “slightly plump“ for Gunjan Saxena biopic and she took 45 days to shed 6 kg. “She is working out six days a week, for two to three hours daily. For the first two days, she does EMS [Electrical Muscle Stimulation] - for 25 minutes, and the remaining four days are dedicated to pilates. She has a back injury because of which her training has to be monitored. Janhvi has a sweet tooth. So, my mother makes these healthy laddoos with jaggery and nuts. Ideally, she is allowed one a day, but she gulps down three of them,” she told the tabloid.

Directed by Sharan Sharma, Kargil Girl is based on the life of India’s first female Indian Air Force combat pilot and first female Shaurya Chakra recipient Gunjan Saxena, who played an important role in the 1999 Kargil War.
