CAB: Protesters damage stage set up for PM Modi's summit with Japanese counterpart

The anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Bill protesters on Wednesday damaged a stage in Assam's Dispur set up for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's summit with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, scheduled for Sunday. The stage was set up on GS Road in Dispur.

The annual summit between PM Modi and Japanese PM Abe will take place between December 15 and 17.

Assam turned into a battleground on Wednesday with massive and violent protests across the state against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in the Rajya Sabha. The government managed to push the contentious legislation through Parliament overruling a vociferous Opposition that alleged it was against the idea of India as a secular nation.

Guwahati, the epicentre of anti-CAB protests, was placed under indefinite curfew while Army was called in at four places and Assam Rifles personnel were deployed in Tripura on Wednesday as the two northeastern states plunged into chaos over the hugely emotive Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, officials said.

Army PRO Lt Col P Khongsai said two Army columns have been deployed in Guwahati city and are carrying out flag marches.

Army has also been deployed in Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Jorhat districts, officials said. Meanwhile, the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Bill protesters attacked the residence of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in Dibrugarh, resulting in the imposition of an indefinite curfew in the district.

Union minister Rameswar Teli's residence was also attacked in the district by the protesters. Dibrugarh Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha said stones were thrown at the house of the chief minister in the Lakhinagar area. Protesters also damaged properties at the house of the Union minister in Duliajan.
