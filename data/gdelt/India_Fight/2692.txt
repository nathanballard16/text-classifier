Separate budget for farmers demanded

With the interim budget slated to be presented by the Union Finance Minister on February 1, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affilated to All India Kisan Sabha on Monday demanded a separate budget for farmers to address various issues of the farming community. The association also sought waiver of all agricultural loans of farmers from nationalised banks and cooperative credit societies.

In a petition submitted to the Collector, the association said that the government was yet to fix base prices for the produces of farmers while the prices of pesticides, manoeuvres, seeds, equipment and wages for workers were fixed.

According to the association, farmers are often forced to sell their produces at low prices which is fixed by traders and intermediaries.

The association wanted such issues to be addressed in the interim budget. It also wanted the government to announce interest-free agricultural loans to revive the farming community.

MLA petitions Collector

DMK MLA from Singanallur, N. Karthik, on Monday submitted a bunch of petitions to the District Collector including the one seeking the district administration to expedite the construction of the road overbridge at SIHS Colony which has been stalled for years. In another petition, Mr. Karhik sought the district administration to take pest control measures at the warehouses of Food Corporation of India (FCI) at Gandhi Ma Nagar and SIHS Colony near Ondipudur. The MLA requested the Collector to take steps to re-lay the 2 km-long FCI Godown Road connecting Sathyamangalam Road which is in bad state.
