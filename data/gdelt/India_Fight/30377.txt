8 killed in expressway accident

Eight members of a Greater Noida family on their way to the Taj Mahal were killed when their car rammed a truck on Yamuna Expressway in Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura district on Sunday, police said.

Five members of the family from Jewar in Gautam Budh Nagar district died on the spot when their car rammed the truck moving ahead of it around 8.30 a.m. in the Baldeo police station area, about 30 km from Mathura city.

Three others succumbed to injuries at a hospital, Superintendent of Police (Rural) Aditya Kumar Shukla said.

According to a police statement, the family was going to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal. Mr. Shukla said the car was completely mangled and they had to use gas cutters to bring out the bodies.

The deceased have been identified as Neeraj (30), Anita (30), Vishnu (23), Taruna (21), Santoshi (19), Shalu (20), Anjali (11) and Gabbar (24), the police officer said.

Truck driver flees

The truck driver fled with his vehicle from the spot after the accident, the officer said.

The 165-km-long Yamuna Expressway, connecting Greater Noida with Agra, has witnessed hundreds of deaths in road accidents over the years, with officials saying that many of them occurred due to overspeeding.

Last Tuesday, three men returning from a wedding in Aligarh to their homes in Ghaziabad died on the expressway after their speeding car crashed into a truck, the police said.
