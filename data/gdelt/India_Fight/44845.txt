Days after the busting of a terror module, followed by the arrests of persons affiliated with Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) and arms seizure at Khalra village in Tarn Tarn, DGP Dinkar Gupta has said that investigation teams are working with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and other national agencies to trace more such sleeper groups.

Gupta, who was in Amritsar to attend an event today, said primary investigations were under way and evidence was being collected to prove the theory that the arms were dropped at Khalra village from a drone.

“We had busted the Maan Singh-Sher Singh terror module in 2017. Since then, 37 or more such sleeper modules have been identified and busted. The target and plan behind the arms drop is still not clear yet but it will be in coming days,” he said.

Gupta said all counter measures had been taken to prevent drone infiltration in future. “It is a big challenge for us and we are working simultaneously to modernise our force to combat drone infiltrations. The BSF and the IAF have also been informed and efforts taken in this direction.”

He also said prison security, too, had been beefed up following the incident. “We have planned to install jammers and upgrade security at the prisons across the state. Issues that need segregated attention are also being looked into.”

With the incidents that hint at the revival of Khalistan movement in Punjab, Gupta said referendum 2020 found no takers in the state. “Referendum 2020 is not a challenge for Punjab Police as it finds no takers or supporters in the state or otherwise.”

As for the blast investigation that occurred on Monday evening in a junkyard in the Islamabad area of Amritsar, in which two people were killed, Gupta said an SIT had been constituted by the Commissioner of Police, Amritsar, Dr Sukhchain Singh Gill.
