On the importance of voting, she said, “It’s a very important day. This day comes once in five years. Please make use of it. I feel India is gaining independence in the real sense of the term today. Because before this, we were servants of the Mughal, the British and the Italian governments. Please exercise your ‘Swaraj (independence)’ and vote.”
