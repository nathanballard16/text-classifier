Bulandshahr violence: Bajrang Dal activist Yogesh Raj arrested

Bajrang Dal activist Yogesh Raj, the prime accused in the killing of Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh in Buladshahr was arrested by the police, a month after violence erupted in the Uttar Pradesh district. Raj, who was on a run since the violence broke out, was arrested late last night from a college in Bulandshahr.

Raj, affiliated with the local Bajrang Dal unit as a Zila sanyojak (district coordinator), confessed to being a part of the mob and indulging in stone pelting. In a video released last month, he had denied being present at the site and said the people are “portraying me as if I am a history-sheeter.”

“Yes, Yogesh Raj has been arrested. He is undergoing medical examination and would be produced in the local court later today for legal proceedings,” Circle Officer (Siyana) Raghvendra Kumar Mishra told PTI Thursday morning.

Subodh Kumar Singh, the station house officer of Siyana, and a local youth, Sumit Kumar, were killed on December 3 in mob violence near Siyana village during protests against alleged cow slaughter.

Raj, with his associates, had lodged an FIR claiming that they saw “seven people slaughtering cows” when they were roaming in the fields. The FIR was lodged against seven people, including minors, under IPC section 295 at Siyana police station.

With Raj’s arrest, the number of those taken into custody in connection with the crime is 31 so far. Last week, the police arrested a key accused, Kalua, who allegedly attacked Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh with an axe. The police also recovered the axe allegedly used in the attack, from his possession. A Delhi taxi driver, Prashant Natt, was also held for allegedly shooting Singh. Police claimed Natt took Singh’s revolver and shot him in the head. Natt (30), who was not named in the FIR registered, was arrested after he was seen in videos of the incident, which was corroborated with testimonies of other accused and technical evidence.
