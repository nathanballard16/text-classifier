Weather News and Analysis

Skymet Weather Team

The Cyclonic storm Maha over Arabian Sea continues to move eastwards with a speed of 10 kmph during past six hours. As of today, i.e. November 7, 2019 at 02:30 its centred over eastcentral & adjoining northeast Arabian Sea near latitude 19.8°N and longitude 68.9°E, about 220 km south-southwest of Porbandar, 190 km west-southwest of Veraval and 230 km west-southwest of Diu. It is very likely to move east-northeastwards, weaken into a Deep Depression over northeast & adjoining eastcentral Arabian Sea during next 12 hours. Continuing to move east-northeastwards, it is very likely to weaken further into a Depression by tomorrow evening, and thereafter a Well Marked Low Pressure Area.

The system is sure a threat to the southern coast of Gujarat but it is now clear that the system is not going to make a landfall over Gujarat. The system will degenerate in the Northeast Arabian Sea, South from Gujarat. Therefore, we do not expect much weather activities over Gujarat. However, moderate showers are expected over Porbandar, Veraval, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Surat, Valsad, Bhavnagar. Any very heavy rains are being ruled out as of now. Although, isolated heavy spells may occur at some parts. Wind speed will be around 40-50 km gusting to 60 kms at times. A few areas might also see winds to the tune of 70 kmph.

Thus, any potential damage has been ruled out over Gujarat now. Although, precautions must be taken while venturing near the sea against any untoward happening. Uprooting of tree branches and minor damage to communication lines is still being anticipated. Sea conditions will remain rough to very rough. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea.
