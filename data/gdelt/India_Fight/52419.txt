Members of Border Guard Bangladesh yesterday arrested 32 people on charge of trespassing into Bangladesh from India yesterday.

Seventeen men, 13 women and two children illegally entered Bangladesh through Daulatpur border in Jashore’s Benapole, said Subedar Mozammel Hossain, commander of 21 Daulatpur BGB camp.

The arrestees claimed to be hailing from Bagerhat and Munshiganj, he added.

According to Subedar Mozammel, a BGB team raided a mango orchard in the border area on information that a large group of people intruded into Bangladesh territory.

BGB found the intruders there, arrested them and later handed them over to Benapole Port Police Station, he added.

This correspondent managed to speak with two of the arrestees.

One of the two, Jorina Begum, 25, said she used to live in Bengaluru and work as a housemaid. Indian police raided her house recently and arrested her for “speaking Bengali”.

Fearing further arrest in India, she intruded into Bangladesh, she said.

Another arrestee Alamgir Khan, 35, said he had been living in Bengaluru along with his family. He along with his wife and sister work as housekeepers in the city.

“Police in India first raided our house, detained us and then handed us over to BSF [Border Security Force] members. In the end, BSF pushed us inside Bangladesh through the border at midnight,” he added.
