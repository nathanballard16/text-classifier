1 dead, two others injured in firing at Howrah barracks

A personnel of Assam Rifles, a central paramilitary force, was killed and two others injured on Thursday morning when a jawan opened fire after an altercation with his colleagues.

The personnel who lost his life was identified as Bholanath Das. The injured, Anil Rajbanshi and Rantu Mani, were admitted to a Kolkata hospital in critical condition. The assailant, Lakshmikant Burman, who fired 18 rounds from his service rifle was arrested. “Burman was arrested. Apparently, he was in a mentally unstable condition...,” said additional director general (law and order), Siddhnath Gupta. The incident took place at Bangalpur Jyotirmoyee Girls High School in Howrah district. The personnel had come to Bengal on poll duty. Polling will be held in the constituencies of Howrah district -- Uluberia and Howrah -- on May 6.

Senior police officials of the district were tight-lipped. Locals said that around 11:20 AM, they heard several gunshots. A police contingent led by an additional superintendent, rushed to spot and cordoned off the school building where the Assam Rifles personnel were set up. Rapid action force personnel were deployed. Howrah district police forwarded a preliminary report to the state secretariat and the chief electoral officer, West Bengal.
