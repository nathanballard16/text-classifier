Sabarimala violence: Over 1800 cases registered, more than 5700 people arrested; Congress blames BJP, CPI(M)

Kerala was mostly peaceful Sunday after four days of widespread violence involving BJP-RSS and ruling CPI(M) workers following the entry of two women under 50 into the Sabarimala temple.

The entry of two women under 50 into the Sabarimala temple last week, the first time since the Supreme Court in September last year lifted the age-linked ban on the entry of women devotees, triggered massive protests in Kerala.

For four days, BJP-RSS and ruling CPI(M) workers clashed with each other as police tried to bring violent protests under control. There were also reports of journalists being attacked by protesters in different parts of the southern state.

However, the state was mostly peaceful Sunday, with 1,869 cases being registered so far and 5,769 people arrested.

The Nair Service Society (NSS), an organisation of the forward Nair community, attacked the state government over the entry of young women into the Sabarimala temple, saying it was making planned move to impose atheism on the people.

However, some state ministers came down heavily on the NSS saying it was voicing the RSS agenda.

The Congress has accused the BJP of instigating violence in Kerala over the Sabarimala issue and blamed the CPI(M) government for failing to maintain law and order in the state.
