Prabhas Wins His Fans' Hearts By Thanking Directors For Moving Their Release Dates For 'Saaho'

For a movie that spends 70 to 80 crores to blow up over 35 cars, bikes and trucks in Abu Dhabi just to shoot an action sequence, you can't expect anything but the best from that movie.

We're not talking about Rohit Shetty's films. We're talking about Saaho, one of the most expensive Bollywood action films ever made, featuring nation's heartthrob Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor.

In case you didn't know, Saaho was earlier expected to be released on Independence Day i.e. August 15.

It's the same day for which a lot of other movies like Mission Mangal and Batla House are lined up as well. Now, the movie's release date has been moved to August 30.

Now, reports suggest that to accommodate the release of Saaho, four other filmmakers have rescheduled the release dates of their films.

So, what do you do, when someone does something good for you? You thank them and express your gratitude. And that's exactly what Prabhas and team Saaho did.

In an Instagram post, Prabhas thanked the actors, directors and producers of the films that shifted their release dates and wished them good luck for their respective projects.

The makers of Saaho too thanked the film fraternity and wrote, "Extremely thankful for producers across all the languages for clearing the way for #Saaho and helping for a bigger release. Action begins in cinemas from 30th Aug!"

Saaho, which was simultaneously shot in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, is now expected to have a solo release across the country.

Saaho also stars Neil Nitin Mukesh, who's first look as Jai, was recently released on social media.

After Saaho, Shraddha Kapoor will be seen in Chhichhore, a fun movie that takes us through the journey of a group of college friends who call themselves 'losers' and how a tragedy reunites them after years.
