Indian Border Force Shoot Alleged Pakistani Intruder

On Friday, Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) foiled an alleged infiltration attempt. They claimed that a Pakistani intruder who was trying to sneak into Indian Territory was shot dead in Manguchak border outpost in Samba Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.

“The Number of intruders who tried to sneak in is yet to be ascertained,” a BSF official said on Friday.

The incident took place after the BSF and Jammu and Kashmir police launched a joint search operation on Thursday to enhance the security setup along the Line of Control (LoC) or de-facto border due to supposed threats posed by Pakistani troops.

On Thursday, the Indian Army accused Pakistan of damaging several houses and injuring civilians in an unprovoked violation of the ceasefire by firing small arms and shelling with mortars along the LoC in Shahpur, Kirni and Qasba sectors in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.
