BJP, AAP clashes over water crisis in the National Capital

The “worsening” water crisis is the major issue the National Capital deals with. Aam Aadmi Party’s alleged failure to deal with the current water availability in Delhi has raised questions upon the party.

Over AAP’s failure of curbing the water crisis, Bharatiya Janata Party leaders during a Delhi Jal Board meeting put up “tough questions” on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who heads the DJB, following which the clashes began erupting between the two parties and the meeting was deferred.

Jai Prakash, BJP’s councillor from Sadar Bazar, said with the arrival of the summer season, the capital city faces the water crisis and the government has no plan to deal with the problem especially in areas like Kirari, Sangam Vihar, Chandni Chowk and localities across the Yamuna River. Earlier having said to provide water to these areas, the party has done nothing so far.

Further adding to the statement he said, rather than passing resolutions at such meetings, the government needs to prepare definite plans to ensure water supplies to villages, JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies.
