RAJKOT: A total of 14,076 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 57.66 lakh were seized in two different operations carried out in Junagadh and Gandhidham of Kutch district in the past 24 hours.

In Vadal village on the outskirts of Junagadh district, a tanker was found abandoned from which police recovered 8,400 IMFL bottles worth Rs 37.80 lakh. “It appears that the bootleggers had got the whiff of the impending police action and they disappeared before we raided the spot,” said Pradeepsinh Jadeja, Junagadh deputy superintendent of police.

Similarly, in Galpadar village of Gandhidham taluka in Kutch district, a truck was found abandoned from which the police seized 5,676 IMFL bottles worth Rs 19.86 lakh.

“No arrests were made as the bootleggers escaped before we raided the spot. However, we have been able to ascertain the identity of the truck driver as Puna Baruka, a resident of Ramvav village of Rapar taluka in Kutch district, following which we have launched a manhunt for him,” said D V Rana, inspector with Gandhidham local crime branch.
