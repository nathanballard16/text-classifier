Maharashtra launches ‘Save Donkey’ drive

The State Animal Husbandry Department has written to all Collectors warning them of the dwindling donkey population and asking them to take preventive measures.

Donkeys are sometimes worked to death. “Donkeys are often over-exploited by their owners, who do very little towards their upkeep. It is one of the biggest reasons for their early deaths,” said an official.

In a meeting, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, who is also an animal rights activist, had raised the issue of illegal slaughter of donkeys.

Also, their skin and blood are used in some countries to treat cancer and for other medicinal purpose. “We have not found any such case in the state, but have asked police officials to be alert,” said the official. Illegal slaughtering of any animal is a crime under the Prevention of Cruelty Act, 1960.

“We have informed the collector as he heads the district-level Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The collectors will take police assistance to ensure that donkeys are saved in the state,” said Dr Prashant Bhad, Deputy Commissioner of the Animal Husbandry Department.
