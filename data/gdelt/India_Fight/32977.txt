New Delhi: The government on Wednesday clarified that there is no plan to scrap the contentious sedition law. In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said that the law needs to be retained to combat the anti-national, terrorist and secessionist elements in the country.

"There is no proposal to scrap the provision under the IPC (Indian Penal Code) dealing with the offence of sedition... there is a need to retain the provision to effectively combat anti-national, secessionist and terrorist elements," Rai said in response to an unstarred question on whether the government is planning to scrap the colonial-era law.

The sedition law, Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code states that 'whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government estab­lished by law in India, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine.'

Critics have opposed the law calling it colonial. A political row erupted when the Congress party, in its election manifesto in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections promised to repeal the sedition law. PM Modi had criticised the Congress' decision as an ' attempt to fulfil demands of Pakistan'.

The law was also criticised when, most recently, in January, the Delhi police filed sedition charges against former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and others for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans during an event at the JNU campus in February 2016.
