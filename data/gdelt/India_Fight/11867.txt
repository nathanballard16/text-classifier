Chennai: In a shocking turn of events, a woman in the capital city of Tamil Nadu was brutally murdered by a man after she refused to tell him the whereabouts of her daughter. The victim has been identified as 41-year-old Revathy who worked as a domestic worker in Chennai's Guindy area.

The incident took place on Friday night when Revathi was returning home after work and was halted by one Vinod, reported The News Minute. Vinod demanded the phone number and location of Revathi's daughter from her. An argument ensued between the two following which Vinod slashed Revathi with a knife and fled on his motorcycle. Revathi was rushed to a hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.

A police investigation was then launched into the matter leading to Vinod's arrest. Officials with the Guindy police told the publication that Vinod had been dating Revathi's daughter for about five years and the two had decided to get married. However, Revathi called off the wedding over Vinod's indulgence in drinking and smoking which is when he began pestering her daughter and Revathi herself.

The accused had even shown up at the daughter's workplace a few days ago which prompted Revathi to move her to a hostel to keep her safe. A police official investigating the matter said that Revathi and her family had reported Vinod to the All Women's Police Station in Guindy in November of last year. However, he was let off with a 'warning'.
