'Tenet': Christopher Nolan and Robert Pattinson touch down Mumbai for a 10-day schedule of the Hollywood film

In May it was reported that Dimple Kapadia is all set to make her Hollywood debut in Christopher Nolan's upcoming directorial Tenet. Talking about the actor landing up a role in Tenet, Dimple's talent manager told Mid Day, "With someone like Nolan, who is secretive about his scripts, the brief provides little information on the role. For the audition, they don't give you a scene from the script. They [Nolan and team] had already seen her footage and had loved her work. When they saw her audition tape, Nolan and the casting director came around, and the rest is history."

Dimple shot a few sequences for the film in Estonia and now Nolan along with Robert Pattinson has touched down Mumbai for its next schedule. The director and the Twilight actor were snapped at the Mumbai airport while exiting and they will be shooting for the film in South Mumbai. Talking about the same, a source stated to Mumbai Mirror, "The main sequences are expected to be filmed shortly. He will leave the city close to the month-end."

It is going to be a 10-day schedule and Nolan and the team are expected to wrap it up by the end of September. Apart from Mumbai, Tenet will also be shot in London and Italy.

Apart from Dimple and Robert, Tenet also stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Kenneth Branagh, Michael Caine, John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki and Clemence Poesy in important roles.

The producers of the film are Nolan and Emma Thomas, whereas Thomas Hayslip is said to serve as executive producer. It is slated to release on July 17, 2019.
