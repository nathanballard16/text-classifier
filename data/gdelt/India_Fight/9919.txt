Opposition parties to meet on Wednesday to firm up common minimum agenda, will also discuss Balakot strike

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties will be meeting here on Wednesday to firm up a common minimum agenda for the Lok Sabha polls to combat the ruling BJP.The Pulwama attack and the subsequent airstrike on Pakistan ’s terror camps by the Indian Air force on Tuesday, will also be at the top of the agenda for the anti-BJP front.The meeting was earlier scheduled to finalise the draft of a common agenda for all the parties who have decided to fight against the BJP together, but Pulwama terror attack and Tuesday’s airstrikes would now be taken into account, as BJP prepares to make the nationalist pitch its main campaigning point to reach out to voters. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, NC leader Farooq Abdullah , Left party leaders Sitaram Yechury (CPM) and D Raja (CPI), SP, BSP, DMK, JDS, AAP, leaders will among the 20-odd parties attending the meeting called by Congress.At an earlier held meeting, Congress president Rahul Gandhi was given the task of finalising a draft of the common minimum agenda, to adopted by the 22 parties who are part of the platform.Whether the document will be finalised on Wednesday is to be seen but it will certainly be taken forward, in the presence of most of the 22 parties, according to a source.While there may not be a proper tie-up between many parties in the group depending on the equations they share with some of them in their respective states, a common agenda of issues like the farmers’ distress, unemployment, social disharmony, would form the crux of the opposition campaign against the Modi regime.Most opposition party leaders also attended the all-party meeting on Tuesday, called by the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to brief them about the airstrikes conducted in the early hours of the day, hence the issue would be taken up by the opposition parties in the context of this official briefing.
