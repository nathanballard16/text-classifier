B-52, aircraft carrier in Mideast over Iran conduct exercise

The U.S. military says a B-52 bomber and an aircraft carrier dispatched to the Mideast over a perceived threat from Iran have conducted a joint exercise together in the Arabian Sea.

The Air Force says the aircraft also "simulated strike operations" in the exercise, which took place on Saturday.
