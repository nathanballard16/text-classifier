Salman Khan salutes the nation as a Marine in Bharat’s fourth poster also featuring Katrina Kaif

Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif's film, Bharat is all set to entertain the audiences on Eid 2019. Over the last few days, Salman has shared three posters of Bharat from different eras. Today, Salman shared the fourth poster in which he can be seen as Marine. Yesterday, the look that Salman shared featured him as a coal miner back in the 1960s. In today's poster, we get to see him clad in a white naval uniform with aviators on. In the hindsight, we can also spot the navy ship.

Katrina Kaif's look in the poster is intense and she can be seen sporting a traditional outfit. With curls adding to her look, Katrina is bound to make fans cheer for her. In the previous poster, we saw her as 'Madam Sir' in formal attire. Salman shared the poster on social media and wrote," Meri Mitti. Mera Desh!#BharatKoSalaam." (My Soil, My country! Salute to India). Bharat has been the talk of the town ever since it went on the floors.

Helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar, Bharat has been shot in different locations all over the world including Malta and in India in Ludhiana, Delhi and Mumbai. Bharat also stars Jackie Shroff, Tabu, Disha Patani and Sunil Grover. It is an adaptation of the South Korean film, An Ode to My Father. The teaser showcases five different looks of Salman, and till now, only four looks have been revealed. It is safe to say that the fifth look would also be out soon. Bharat’s trailer is expected to be release on April 24 and the film is slated to release on June 5, 2019.
