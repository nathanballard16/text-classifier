Google Pixel takes a direct jibe at Apple's iPhone

He further states that from Google's pov, it makes perfect sense to highlight the one thing that the Pixel range is really well known for - camera quality. "Pitting it against the best and most well-known phone camera (one that even advertises with entire billboards featuring a photo taken by the device), makes even more sense. That bold stand would make people take a serious look at the Pixel 3a to at least satisfy the 'Seriously? That good?' claim. Beyond that initial curiosity though, people would get down to comparing the brass-tacks of the phone - battery life, processor speed, smoothness of day-to-day operation and so on. When it comes to those nuances (which matter a lot to many people), there are far more rivals to choose from - OnePlus, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo etc.," Srinivasan explains.
