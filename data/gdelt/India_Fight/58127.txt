Trinamool Congress gives Rs 5 lakh to kin of Mangaluru firing victims

MANGALURU: A two-member delegation of the Trinamool Congress on Saturday met the families of the two men who were killed in police firing during an anti-CAA stir in Mangaluru . Jaleel Bengre and Nauseen Kudroli were killed during the December 19 protests, which had turned violent.West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool supremo Mamata Banerjee announced on Thursday a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the two victims.The delegation, comprising former Union minister Dinesh Trivedi and MP Md Nadimul Haque, arrived at the Mangaluru International Airport and visited the families at their homes, where the cheques were handed over. "Both the families have lost their sons, who are citizens of this country and our brothers. There is no politics in this (handing out the compensation). Mamata Banerjee has always felt compassionate about such incidents," Trivedi told media.The Karnataka government has held back the ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each it had announced, pending investigation. "We would not like to comment on the matter. Compensation can never bring back life. We are here on humanitarian grounds and are trying to comfort the families who have lost their dear ones," he said. "A death is a death and there is no caste or religion attached to it. There is an agitation going on in Hong Kong for over 7 months now, yet there are no deaths due to police action," Trivedi added.
