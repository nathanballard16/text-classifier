Hizb suspected to be behind killing of five labourers in J&K

NEW DELHI: Hizbul Mujahideen has emerged as the prime suspect in Tuesday’s killing of five non-Kashmiri labourers in Kulgam , according to sources in J&K police who blamed the the terrorist organisation for the recent spate of attack on outsiders.The determination about Hizbul’s hand in the targeting of the workers from West Bengal followed J&K police identifying Aijaz Ahmad Malik, a Hizb terrorist, as the killer of Narayan Dutt, a truck driver from Jammu. Dutt was killed on Monday as part of a campaign to target truckers and other outsiders.Malik was killed the same day in an encounter with terrorists near the spot in Bijbehara, Anantnag, where Dutt had been killed. Son of Abdul Ahad Malik and resident of Dardsun Kralpora in Kupwara district, Aijaz had gone missing on September 28 last year and went on to join HuM. He has been an active terrorist ever since.“This establishes the complicity of Hizbul Mujahideen in the terror attacks targeted at non-Kashmiri ‘outsiders’ in J&K. Hizbul is also suspected of killing five labourers — all from West Bengal — in Kulgam on Tuesday evening,” a senior intelligence officer said.While HuM is an ‘indigenous’ terror outfit, with most of its members and recruits being Kashmiris, it has become a vital part of the terror machinery assembled by Pakistan. Its top leadership based in PoK gets directions, funding, resources and training from Pakistan’s ISI. Its cadres work in coordination with Pakistan-based foreign terrorist outfits active in J&K, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed , with their familiarity with the local terrain providing a lethality to the jihadis pushed in from across the border.With Islamabad under pressure from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which recently decided to retain Pakistan in the ‘grey list’ with a warning to deliver on its full action plan by February 2020, it is believed to be relying on so-called ‘indigenous’ Kashmiri terror outfits like HuM to carry out targeted attacks to protest the abrogation of Article 370. Outsiders associated with the apple trade are especially being targeted to discourage Kashmiris from resuming normal daily life and business activities.Sources indicated that ensuring fool-proof security of labourers and ‘outsiders’ in J&K was a arduous task as their numbers were significant and they were also spread out far, often moving from one part of the Valley to another. “To have a blanket arrangement that will protect each one of them is an enormous challenge,” a senior central paramilitary officer said.
