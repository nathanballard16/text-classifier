Also, the pretty lady is now every photographer's delight and that's why she has become the most sought after cover girl of b-town.The stunner is rocking one magazine cover after the other like a boss and we are loving all her stylish looks. But, her latest magazine shoot is making news for another reason, and that is for wearing a dress similar to the one worn by Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor.For her shoot with Hello magazine India, Sara wore a lovely cut-work lehenga in silver and nude with trademark Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla work. The outfit comprised a skirt with mirrorwork, a matchign bralette with choker neck and a sheer dupatta. Sonam wore a similar ensemble in a rose gold hue for one of her scenes in her hit flick, Veere Di Wedding.
