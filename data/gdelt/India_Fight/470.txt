WATCH: Women are not going to Sabarimala to make love with Ayyappa, says BJP MP

At a time when Kerala is witnessing widespread agitations and violent protests led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and other right-wing organisations over the entry of two women of menstruating age to Sabarimala temple, a BJP MP lauded the women saying redundant traditions must go.

In a short chat with THE WEEK's Deputy Chief of Bureau Vijaya Pushkarna, North-West Delhi MP and dalit leader Udit Raj wondered “how an Ayyappa temple can be above the Constitution”.

He trashed the argument about Lord Ayyappa's celibacy, and that women's entry into the Sabarimal temple will 'destroy' it. “Women are not going to Sabarimala to make love with Lord Ayyappa,” he said. "If Ayyappa is God, he is everywhere. Women, too, are everywhere around," Raj argued.

"There were several traditions like Sati and untouchability. But all these traditions have gone; redundant traditions must go,” said the MP.

Raj said that his opinions are in his capacity as the national chairman of the All India Confederation of SC/ST Organizations, and not as a politician. He, however, dodged the question over his party's role in the Sabarimala issue.

The Supreme Court had, on September 28, struck down the custom of banning women aged between 10 and 50 from entering the hill shrine, sparking off protests in the state.
