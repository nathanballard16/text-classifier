DGP Jangid to retire today

DGP S. R. Jangid, a 1985-batch IPS officer, who successfully led an operation to arrest members of the notorious Bavaria gang involved in a series of murders including that of an AIADMK MLA, will retire from service on Wednesday. He is serving as DGP-cum-Chief Vigilance Officer at the State Transport Corporation in Kumbakonam.

His ‘Operation Bavaria’ had inspired the hit Tamil film Dheeran Adhigaram Ondru starring actor Karthi.

Mr. Jangid told The Hindu that ever since he was given a non-police posting as CVO of State Transport Corporation in Nagercoil in 2011, he began writing books.

His works include ‘Art and Culture of India’, ‘Indian Economy’, ‘Ancient India’, ‘Medieval India’ and ‘Modern India’. His latest publication is ‘My Collection of Catchphrases with their Romantic Origins’.

“I have written these to contribute something for posterity. Etymology is my hobby. I was writing whenever I had time,” he added.

Hailing from an agricultural family in Barmer district, Rajasthan, Mr. Jangid was Assistant Professor in a government college before becoming an IPS officer and holding several key posts including as city Police Commissioner in Tirunelveli and Madurai.
