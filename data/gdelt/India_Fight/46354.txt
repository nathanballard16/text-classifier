On September 25, bike-borne criminals robbed a businessman of Rs 20 lakh in Keshav Puram in West Delhi. A day before a property dealer was murdered by a gangster in Dwarka Noida is not different. September saw at least 11 encounters between criminals and police in September in this NCR town. In most cases, criminals got bullet injuries and went behind the bars. On October 3, three gangsters got bullet injuries in an encounter in the phase 2 area.

Two encounters took place in sector 24 on September 17. A criminal with a Rs 1 lakh reward got bullet injury in sector 39 on September 16. In Ghaziabad too, encounters have become a commonplace.
