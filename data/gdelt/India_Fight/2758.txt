Delhi Police Did Not Issue Advisory On Possible Terror Attacks

A message that has gone viral on social media claims that all “officers have been requested to inform their family and loved ones to avoid Chandni Chowk and other crowded areas in Delhi and Bangalore" as two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) groups have reached Delhi and "are planning on carrying out two suicide attacks".

The viral message, "received" from international branch, further claims that national capital's "electrical whole sale market in Chandi Chowk area" is the likely target.

The ‘advisory’ has been shared on Twitter and Facebook by several users.
