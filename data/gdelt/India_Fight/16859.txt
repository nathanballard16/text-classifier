Photos: Mahesh Babu unveils his much-awaited wax statue in Hyderabad; to be placed in Madame Tussauds Singapore

Last year on April 26, Mahesh Babu took to his social media pages and announced that he is set to get immortalised as a wax statue at Madame Tussauds museum in Singapore. Now after almost a year, the wax statue of Telugu superstar has been unveiled at AMB Cinemas in Hyderabad today. This is the first time that a wax statue has been flown to India from Singapore for the launch. Mahesh has become the second Telugu superstar after Prabhas to get a wax statue of himself.

At the launch held in Hyderabad, Mahesh was joined by his wife and former actor Namrata Shirodkar along with their children - son Gautam and daughter Sitara. Talking about the statue, it looks as handsome as Babu and is inspired by his look from one of his hit films, Srimanthudu. Mahesh couldn't contain his excitement after looking at the statue and immediately went and posed with it. The talented actor also clicked selfies with his statue.
