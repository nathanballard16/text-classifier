Reel to real: Captured IAF pilot's father worked on Mani Ratnam's 'Kaatru Veliyidai,' story hits close to home now

An old Youtube video of the father of Indian Air Force's pilot being held as a captive by Pakistan, speaking at the audio launch of filmmaker Mani Ratnam's Kaatru Veliyidai in Chennai, has been doing the rounds on social media platforms. While the entire country is praying for the safe return of the IAF pilot, the video where his father talks about the general apathy of people down south for the Indian soldiers has grabbed everyone's attention.

Kaatru Veliyidai revolved around the capture of IAF pilot Varun Chakrapani (played by Karthi) by the Pakistani Army during the 1999 Kargil War. "There are many experiences in my life, but I never thought in my wildest dreams that I'd be here in a movie audio release. It's a great honour. Thank you for the opportunity and privilege," IAF pilot's father had said.

"Talking and filming about the Air Force and feeling for the Air Force is something which is perhaps missing on our Indian celluloid. When I heard about Kaatru Veliyidai, I wanted to reach out to the team and support them. The Indian Air Force, as well as our entire armed forces, has been fighting a continuous war ever since our independence from 1947. Many do not realize and much so, deep down in the south, Chennai. And, these are the films that will awaken an audience and the people to feel for the military to do whatever they have to do with pride and honour so that our country and nation can flourish. Recognizing our efforts in the film is really an honour for the Indian Air Force and I thank Mani Ratnam on behalf of everyone for it," said the father of IAF pilot.
