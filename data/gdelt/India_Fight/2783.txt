New Delhi: A 39-year-old woman, who visited the Sabarimala shrine earlier this month was not allowed to enter her in-laws' residence on Tuesday. Kanakadurga, 39, who entered the Lord Ayyappa shrine on January 2, has moved to a government home after her in-laws refused to accept her as a result of the anger against her decision to visit the shrine. On January 15, Kanakadurga was admitted to a hospital in Kozhikode, after her mother-in-law allegedly hit her with a wooden plank.

Kanakadurga and Bindu entered the Sabarimala shrine, almost three months after the Supreme Court allowed the entry of women in the age group 10-50. The two had later approached the Supreme court seeking 24X7 security. "Issue writ of mandamus directing authorities to provide full security, 24x7, to the two women who have entered the temple, and to deal with protesters indulging in acts of violence, physical and/or verbal on social media or otherwise against them in accordance with the law," the petition said.

According to reports, Kanakadurga's family was unaware of her plans to visit the Sabarimala shrine. According to The News Minute, her brother Bharath Bhushan had alleged that facilitating her and Bindu's entry into the Sabarimala shrine was a CPI(M) conspiracy and Kerala police.
