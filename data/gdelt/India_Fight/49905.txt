Shashi Tharoor, Harsh Goenka take a dig at Delhi’s poor air quality on Twitter

While many are complaining about this concerning situation, some are dishing out sarcastic posts on social media – including politician Shashi Tharoor and business tycoon Harsh Goenka.

Both Tharoor and Goenka shared a similar image. The only difference is that in the picture shared by Tharoor an extra line is written in Hindi. Take a look yourself what Shashi Tharoor and Harsh Goenka tweeted:

People dropped all sorts of comments on Shashi Tharoor and Harsh Goenka’s posts. While some supported them, others were not-so-convinced.

Seriously the air quality has gone down so drastically that breathing has become difficulty . You actually feel like breathing smoke — Shivani Mittal (@Astro_Healer_Sh) November 1, 2019

“The air quality has started improving. We are expecting further improvement by today [Saturday] evening. A western disturbance is approaching and this would help to flush out more pollutants. The air quality is likely to come down to very poor levels by Sunday,” said a CPCB official.
