Pakistan takes control of Hafiz Saeed's terror outfit Jamaat-ud-Dawa's headquarters in Lahore

Hafiz Saeed's request to remove his name from the UN list of banned terrorists has also been rejected.

Even as the United Nations rejected Jamaat ud Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed's appeal to delist him as a banned terrorist, Pakistan's Punjab government has taken over the Jamaat headquarters along with the banned Falah-e-Insaniat.

The Punjab government has taken over the Jamaat and FIF headquarters in Lahore and Muridke, respectively.

JuD and FIF owned mosques in Islamabad have also been taken over by the Punjab police.

Earlier on Thursday, in a significant development, the United Nations rejected an appeal of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed, the 2008 Mumbai terror attack mastermind, to remove his name from its list of banned terrorists.

Notably, the decision comes at a time when UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee has received a new request to ban Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Pakistan-based JeM has claimed responsibility for the strike.

The UN decision to reject appeal of Saeed, also a co-founder of terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), came after India provided detailed evidence including "highly confidential information" about his activities, sources told PTI, adding that the verdict of the global body was conveyed to his lawyer Haider Rasul Mirza earlier this week.

Saeed, chief of UN-designated terrorist organisation Jammat--ud-Dawa (JuD), was banned on December 10, 2008 by the United Nations Security Council after the horrific Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed.

Saeed had filed an appeal with the UN through Lahore-based law firm Mirza and Mirza in 2017, while he was still under house arrest in Pakistan, for removal of the ban.
