Trial judge to sum up on Monday December 16 - Guyana Chronicle

ON Monday, December 16, 2019, HIGH Court Judge Jo-Ann Barlow is expected to sum up the evidence in the murder of Sunil Singh called ‘Grey,’ who was killed two years ago in the vicinity of the Blue Martini nightclub in Kitty.

Thereafter, the judge will hand over the case to the jury for consideration and verdict.

Currently on remand for the indictment is 31-year-old Shawn Harris called ‘Shawny,’ formerly of Pike Street, Kitty, Georgetown.

The charge alleged that Harris, on February 5, 2017, at Owen Street, Kitty, murdered Singh. Harris is represented by attorney-at-law Maxwell McKay, while prosecutors Shawnette Austin and Sarah Martin are representing the state.

According to reports, a party of police officers on patrol went to the Blue Martini nightclub and closed the club around 02:45hrs on February 5, 2017, after which they left.

However, shortly after, according to Charles Valenzuela, an employee of the nightspot, three men arrived and wanted to enter the club.

At that point in time the young man informed them that the club was closed and that resulted in an argument, during which one of the men stabbed Valenzuela to his left arm.

Singh, who was present at the time, intervened and was trying to make peace, when the suspect dealt him a ‘lash’ to his head.

Singh then reportedly ran north into Railway Street, Kitty, and was pursued by his attacker, who caught up with him and stabbed him several times.

Both Singh and Valenzuela were rushed to the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation, where Singh was pronounced dead on arrival and Valenzuela was treated and sent away.

Harris was released from prison in 2016 after serving a sentence on a drug charge. He was also charged in connection with the Bank of Baroda robbery committed at Mon Repos, East Coast Demerara, on January 22, 2016.
