Earlier last week, an altercation between Delhi police personnel and a Sikh autorickshaw driver led to protests in the city's Mukherjee Nagar locality. Ever since the incident, a lot of social media activity trying to spread hatred and disturb the peace by circulating morphed and edited videos has come to attention.
