Amid tension over Pulwama attack, Pakistan calls back envoy “For Consultations”

NEW DELHI: Amid tension between India and Pakistan over the Pulwama terror attack in which over 40 soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) died, the Pakistan High Commissioner to India has been called back to Islamabad for consultations.

Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said on Twitter stated that “We have called back our High Commissioner in India for consultations. He left New Delhi this morning.”

India’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, was called to New Delhi for consultations the same day. India also withdrew the MFN status following the February 14 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district which claimed over 49 CRPF lives.

According to the sources, India had summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood on Friday and a very strong diplomatic protest was lodged over the Pulwama terror attack.

Government sources said India conveyed that Pakistan must take immediate and verifiable action against the Jaish-e-Mohammad and that it must immediately stop any groups or individuals associated with terrorism operating from its territories.

In the deadliest terror attack on security forces in Kashmir, 49 CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday when their convoy was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for the attack.
