Maharashtra: 71-year-old kills abusive son, sits next to his body for entire night before surrendering

A 71-year-old man killed his abusive son in the evening, sat next to his body the entire night and surrendered to police the next morning.

Damodar Balapure, a resident of Nagpur in Maharashtra, killed his 38-year-old son Sanjay on Wednesday night, a report in Times of India said. Sanjay had allegedly threatened to kill his parents as they failed to give him Rs 25,000 for buying a motorcycle.

After the fight, when Sanjay went to sleep, Damodar stabbed him in the head with a sharp object. He then called his relatives and told them that he was sitting next to his body and asked if he should surrender.

My father-in-law told me he was sitting beside Sanjay’s body. He wanted me to inform the rest of the relatives about Sanjay’s death, Damodar's son-in-law Devendra Sathunkar told the police. My father-in-law wanted to know whether he should surrender before the police. We told him he should, he said.

Sanjay was earlier accused of killing his father-in-law and had been released from jail in April after several years of incarceration in connection with the case. His wife lives at her parent's house in Amravati with their seven-year-old daughter, while their son, 10, was with his grandparents and Sanjay in Nagpur.

The family sources quoted in the news report said that Sanjay worked as a carpenter like his father, but he spent everything he earned on liquor and frequently asked for money from his parents. He would turn violent and threaten to kill his parents. He would also throw away food, leaving his parents and son starving to torture for money.

The cops at Hudkeshwar police station, where he surrendered on Thursday morning, have arrested Damodar for murder. He has been sent to judicial custody till July 22.
