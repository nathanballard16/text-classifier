Patna, June 12: The Nitish Kumar-led Bihar Cabinet has approved a proposal to punish sons and daughters who abandon their elderly parents with a jail term. The proposal can be a game changer if it formally makes it compulsory for wards to look after parents.

The proposal of Bihar social welfare department has provisions for punishments which could go up to imprisonment if wards do not look after their parents properly in their old ages.

The cases against the wards will be registered under the non-bailable section in Bihar after receiving complaints from the elderly parents.
