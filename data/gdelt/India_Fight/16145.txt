Chowkidar means honesty, patriotism, PM Narendra Modi tells guards

NEW DELHI: Continuing with his effort to put Rahul Gandhi on the backfoot over its “chowkidar-chor-hai jibe”, Prime Minister took pot shots at the Congress president accusing the latter of denigrating the community of watchmen.In an audio message to watchmen from all across the country as part of BJP’s “Main Bhi Chowkidar” campaign, Modi said since his rivals lacked guts to name him directly, they are resorting to slogans which have put every watchman under the cloud.The Prime Minister emphasised that the word “chowkidar” was synonymous with honesty and dedication.Modi projecting himself as the country's ' chowkidar ,' had led to Gandhi coming up with the slogan “chowkidar chor hai” after the controversy over the Rafale deal cropped up.BJP’s “Main bhi chowkidar” (I too am watchman) drive on social media is aimed at turning the tables on Congress.Without naming Gandhi, Modi said “naamdaars” (dynasts) have a habit to spread hate against those who believe in work and they will continue to insult them even if somebody becomes a Prime Minister.In a blog, the PM also accused Congress of insulting institutions, including Parliament, judiciary, media and the armed forces, when it was in office and urged people to think wisely before casting their vote.“As you go to vote - remember the past and how one family's desire for power cost the nation so greatly. If they could do it then, they can surely do it now,” he wrote.“Think wisely: From the press to Parliament. From soldiers to free speech. From the Constitution to the courts. institutional insult is the Congress way,” he said.The PM alleged dynastic parties have never been comfortable with a free and vibrant press. Modi said he wants to tell Congress that no amount of intimidation will change the ground realities.The CBI, he alleged, became “Congress Bureau of Investigation” and was used time and again against political rivals.He said a policy decision taken by no less than the Union Cabinet was torn into pieces by someone who was not a member of any ministry and that too, in a press conference, a reference to Rahul Gandhi tearing up a copy of the ordinance (during the UPA regime) which sought to overturn a Supreme Court ruling on immediate disqualification of a lawmaker upon conviction.“The NAC was created as a body parallel to the Prime Minister's Office. And then, Congress talks about institutions?” he asked.Modi alleged Congress has always seen the defence sector as a source of income which is why the armed forces never got the respect from the party Congress that they deserved. After 1947, every Congress government has seen multiple defence scams, he said, adding “every middleman is linked to one family”.
