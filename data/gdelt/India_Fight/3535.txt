New Delhi: Times Now has accessed the diary of a Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorist, which exposes Pakistan’s nefarious designs to brainwash the youngsters. The diary gives a glimpse of the journey of a youngster from a home in Kashmir to a Lashkar training camp.

In the diary, the terrorist, Suhaib Farooq, had written that his ambition was to become a martyr, his favourite tunes were those Azadi slogans and his role model was Hafiz Saeed, the 2008 Mumbai attacks mastermind from Pakistan.

In the diary, Suhaib mentioned that his happiest moment in life was when he was released from jail. “I want to kill informers,” mentioned Suhaib while writing about his ‘most vibrant wish’. However, just like any other youngster, Suhaib had a crush on Harley-Davidson bikes.

This underlines how Pakistan is radicalising, brainwashing and poisoning the minds of the youngsters in the Kashmir Valley.

Three terrorists, including Suhaib, were killed in an encounter with security forces in the Baramulla district last week. The security forces had launched a cordon and search operation in the district's Binner area following a tip-off about the presence of terrorists in the area.

As soon as the terrorists opened fire on the security forces, the search operation turned into a gun battle. Weapons and other incriminating material were also recovered from the spot.
