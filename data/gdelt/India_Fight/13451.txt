Explained: Why US is dragging the issue of Pakistan's misuse of F-16 jets against India

India has given proof to US on Pak's use of F-16 when it violated Indian airspace to target military installations.

Tensions between India and Pakistan flared up after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.

India launched a counter-terror operation in Balakot on February 26. The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated but was pushed back by the Indian Air Force which shot down one Pakistani F-16 jet in the process. India also lost a MiG-21 and its pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured. He was handed over to India on March 1.

While IAF has provided proof of Pakistan's use of F-16, Islamabad has said that no F-16 fighter jets were used in the offensive against India.

#Gravitas | Why is Pakistan trying to prove that the fighter jet shot down by IAF was not an F-16 Fighter. Is Pakistan afraid of the U.S. or #LockheedMartin, the maker of F-16 fighter jets?@Palkisu sums up. pic.twitter.com/bcMlS9FMSg — WION (@WIONews) March 6, 2019

It is clear why Pakistan would not want the US to know that it used an F-16 jet to launch an attack against Indian military installations. However, it is curious to see that Washington is dragging the issue and is yet to seek answers from Islamabad.
