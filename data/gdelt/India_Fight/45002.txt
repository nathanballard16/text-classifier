While imposing the ban, the Centre said it was of the opinion that the JKLF is “in close touch with militant outfits” and is supporting extremism and militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere. It said the JKLF-Malik claims “secession of a part of the Indian territory from the union” and supports terrorist and separatist groups fighting for this purpose.
