The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted searches at four places in connection with a terror funding case in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Sunday.



The NIA team was accompanied by police and paramilitary CRPF that conducted the raids.



According to NIA sources, raids are still going on in connection with the terror funding case in the Kashmir Valley.



NIA teams had conducted searches at businessman's house Gawhar Ahmed Bhat, son of Mohammad Akbar Bhat of Mir Sahib old town Baramulla, Sanaullah Bhat of Krankshivan locality Sopore, Tanveer Ahmad and Asif Lone of Handwara," sources said.



Earlier, the probe body had carried out raids in many parts of Kashmir in a similar case.

So far, many Hurriyat Conference leaders have been arrested by NIA in connection with terror financing and most of them are lodged in Tihar Jail, New Delhi.

There are also some businessmen who are in custody, including top entrepreneur Zahoor Watali.

Last week, the probe agency had carried out searches at the premises of two traders in connection with alleged cross-Line of Control (LoC) trade.

Media reports said the NIA officers, who were assisted by Jammu and Kashmir police, had conducted raids at the house of Ghulam Ahmad Wani in Keller area of Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir.



Ahmed Wani was allegedly involved in cross-LoC trade before his suspension by the authorities on February 14, 2019.

"Another raid was carried out at the Parimpora fruit Mandi in Srinagar," said NIA sources.



The raids are part of the ongoing investigation against suspected terror funding in the state.
