If Pakistan fires a bullet, we will surely bomb them: Amit Shah

Srinagar: Addressing a public rally at Sitamarhi, Bhartiya Janata Party’s president Amit Shah said that “If Pakistan fires a bullet, we will surely bomb them.”

While praising Modi’s government, Mr. Shah said that it was the Modi government that has truly secured the borders of the country and made national security as its foremost priority.

“The Prime Minister has taken effective steps to secure the borders of the country. In the regime of UPA-I and II, enemy forces used to run havoc in the country but no action was taken on that front,” Mr. Shah contended

He further said that in past, 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives in the Pulwama attack sponsored by Pakistan, “due to the decisive nature of PM Modi, our brave Indian Air Force (IAF) troops retaliated and entered enemy territory to debase their terror camps. India is only the third country after Israel and United States of America (USA) to have retaliated to terrorism in this brave manner.”

Mr Shah asserted that until BJP is alive, it will make sure that Kashmir is an integral part of India. He was reacting over the statement given by former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.

Mr. Abdullah said that “Kashmir should have a different Prime Minister. It is very unfair and this shows their design that they want Kashmir to not be part of the nation. Till the date, BJP workers are alive, we will make sure that Kashmir is an integral part of India,” Shah said
