NEW DELHI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A woman Naxalite was killed in a gunfight with government forces on Tuesday in central Indian state of Chattisgarh, police said.

The gunfight broke out inside forests of Dabbakonta in Chintagupha area of Sukma district, about 463 km south of Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh.

"A gunfight broke out this morning in forest area at Dabbakonta village between a joint team of security forces and Naxals," a police official said. "In the stand-off, a woman Naxal cadre was killed."

Reports said some Naxals managed to escape during the gunfight.

Policemen involved in the firefight have not suffered any casualty in the stand-off, officials said.

Last week, four Naxals including three woman cadres were killed in a fierce gunfight inside forests of Dhamtari district.

Currently, Naxalites are active in more than a third of India's 600-odd districts across central and eastern India.

India's former prime minister Manmohan Singh once termed the Naxalite movement as India's "greatest internal security challenge."
