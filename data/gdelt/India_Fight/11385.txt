Indian Air Force Pilot To Be Released By Pakistan At Around 3:30 PM

News 18 has reported that security measures have been tightened at the Wagah border to control the increasing number of people gathering there to welcome Varthaman.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had on 28 September announced in the country’s parliament that Varthaman would be released by Pakistan today (1 March) as a 'gesture of peace'. The Indian Air Force, however, rejected the claim, saying Pakistan was under obligation to send the fighter back to India.

Pakistani authorities will bring the pilot from Rawalpindi to Lahore and handed over first to the International Committee of Red Cross under rules of the Geneva Convention, which in turn will hand him over to India.

Money Control reported that a delegation of the IAF would on Friday receive Wing Commander Varthaman at the Wagah border.

Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has offered to receive Abhinandan Varthaman at the Attari border, India Today reported. According to the report, the Wing Commander would be released at 3.30 pm.
