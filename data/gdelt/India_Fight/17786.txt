Pakistan Won ‘Fifth-Generation War’, Indian Ex-General Claims

According to him, the ISPR had proved that media remains a highly effective tool in hybrid war, including the information conflict, in which Pakistan “showed great professional skills”.

Hasnain claimed that it’s impossible to win a traditional war on a battlefield in modern times, and that it took “even the United States” 18 years to realise the fact.

His remarks came a few days after the Pakistani Foreign Ministry stated that it has thoroughly investigated India’s dossier related to the 14 February Pulwama terror attack and has neither found any evidence of terror camps at the locations mentioned by New Delhi, nor of any person mentioned in the document that could be linked to the attack.

“While 54 detained individuals are being investigated, no details linking them to Pulwama have been found so far. Similarly, the 22 pin locations shared by India have been examined. No such camps exist. Pakistan is willing to allow visits, on request, to these locations”, the nation's Foreign Ministry pointed out.
