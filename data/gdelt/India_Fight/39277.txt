‘Language belongs to a region, not a religion’

Today’s songs are... Allah miya,” exclaimed Shabana Azmi, as she spoke about the lyrics her father Kaifi Azmi penned for Hindi movies. Speaking to CE about the current state of Urdu in India, Azmi said it was sad that the language was pushed into becoming a language of Muslims. “A language belongs to a region, not a religion,” she said, recounting the time her father returned his Padma Shri after a minister’s statement against Urdu becoming the second language in a state. But today, Urdu festivals like Jashn-e-Rekhta are promoting the language, and have gained quite an audience. Kaifi saab wrote about how both the man and woman have to march together.
