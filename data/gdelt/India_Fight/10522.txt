Russia is concerned about rising tensions between India and Pakistan relations and called on both sides to show restraint, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

"Russia calls on India and Pakistan for restraint in connection with the border incident," Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

India-Pakistan tensions persisted today as the Indian Air Force (IAF) chased away intruding Pakistani fighter jets in Jammu and Kashmir's Nowshera sector with India shooting down a Pakistani F-16 which fell on the Pakistani side.

According to Dmitry Peskov, Moscow is following the development of events.

"We are extremely concerned about the news coming in, we are very closely monitoring the situation and, of course, we urge all parties to show restraint," said a Kremlin spokesman.

India shot down one of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16s that had come close to the LoC in Nowshera sector. The aircraft fell three kilometres in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The incident occurred a day after IAF jets bombed the biggest training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) outfit in Balakot.

Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia also released a statement regarding the growing tensions in India and Pakistan.

"We express our serious concern about the aggravation of the situation along the Line of Control between India and Pakistan and the outbreak of tensions between friendly states," the comment said.

"We call on both sides to show restraint and step up efforts to resolve existing problems by political and diplomatic means. We are ready to further assist in strengthening the counter-terrorism potential of New Delhi and Islamabad," it added.
