"This," says gallery owner Phillip Niemeyer, "is an attempt to take a picture of our time and place by photographing the people in it and of it: a portrait of 100 people of every age – from newborn to the most senior – who live in, work in, grew up in, or nowadays frequent the neighborhood of East Austin around East 12th Street." So the gallery is temporarily functioning as a lounge for people of all ages to hang out, talk, and listen – and as a hub for Northern-Southern's photodocumentary project. Because they're inviting the community to events where a photographer will take pictures; they'll also take field trips to photograph those who can't make it out; and all that's collected will be exhibited at the gallery in June. See website for details.
