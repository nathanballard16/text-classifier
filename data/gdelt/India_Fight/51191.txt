However, the fire was completely doused by 12.15pm,” Jadeja added.

There were around 400 types of chemicals stored in the warehouse as it got burnt, locals could feel burning sensation in the eyes. Seeing the intensity of the fire, the fire department had also alerted the emergency ward of SSG Hospital. But no casualties or injuries were caused.
