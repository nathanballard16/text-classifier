35 killed as bus crashes into gorge in Indian Kashmir

Srinagar, Kashmir (dpa) - At least 35 people including a newborn baby were killed when an overcrowded bus plunged into a mountain gorge in India-administered Kashmir on Monday, police said.

The bus skidded off the road as the driver was negotiating a curve and plunged into a 150-metre gorge in Kishtwar district.

"The bus hit rocks as it rolled down the mountain slope and is in a badly-mangled state. While 21 passengers were killed on the scene, 14 more died on the way to hospitals or in hospitals," area police chief Amrit Katoch told dpa.

Rescue teams evacuated 17 more passengers injured in the crash. Three of them were in a critical condition and were airlifted by a helicopter to the city of Jammu for treatment, Katoch added.

Local police said the bus had around 30 seats and was overcrowded.

"We are investigating if it was the driver's negligence or mechanical failure. But there could be many other factors ... The roads in this region are in poor condition," a local police officer said on condition of anonymity.

India has the highest number of traffic fatalities in the world. An average of 135,000 people die on the country's roads each year, according to government data.

Many accidents are reported in mountainous regions like Kashmir and are usually caused by reckless driving, bad roads or the poor condition of vehicles.

On Thursday, 11 students were killed when their bus fell into a mountain gorge on another Himalayan road in Indian Kashmir.

Exactly a week prior to that, 44 people were killed in a similar accident in the neighbouring mountain state of Himachal Pradesh.
