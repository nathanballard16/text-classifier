Bengal BJP pays tributes to slain troopers

Kolkata, March 8 : West Bengal BJP leaders on Friday paid tributes to the two slain security personnel from the state, who were killed in Jammu and Kashmir earlier this year.

BJP National Secretary Rahul Sinha presented mementos to the bereaved family members of CRPF trooper Bablu Santra, killed in Pulwama terror strike on February 14 and BSF Assistant Commandant Vinay Prasad, shot dead in sniper fire from across the border in Kashmir's Samba sector on January 15.

Banamala Santra, the mother of Pulwama martyr from Howrah district, said she was proud of her son, adding no politics should be involved in the programme at the state BJP headquarters.

"I am happy and honoured to be able to come here. I am proud of my son," she said.

Mother and wife of the other slain soldier Prasad were also present.
