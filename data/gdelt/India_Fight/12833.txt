300 mobiles were active, were trees using them? Rajnath Singh urges Cong to go to Pak and 'count bodies'

He took a dig at the opposition for questioning the number of terrorists killed and said the parties were up to, "kitne mare, kitne mare?" (how many died?) "Should our Air Force go and count the bodies after the attack -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...? What is this joke?" he questioned.

"The NTRO, which has an authentic system, said that 300 mobile phones were active (at the Balakot site). Were these mobile phones used by the trees? Now will you (opposition) not believe the NTRO also?" Singh said.

He said politics should not be done only to form government, but it should be done to build the country.

"If my Congress friends feel that the numbers should be informed to them, then I would like to say that it you want to go to Pakistan, then go, count and ask people there that how many were killed by our Air Force jawans," Singh said.

Punjab minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu said, "300 terrorist dead, Yes or No? What was the purpose then? Were you uprooting terrorist or trees? Was it an election gimmick? Deceit possesses our land in guise of fighting a foreign enemy. Stop politicising the Army, it is as sacred as the State," he said, adding "Oonchi Dukaan, Pheeka Pakwan" (big talk, no delivery).



He said, "Skimmed milk masquerades as cream, things are seldom as they seem." He also put out a video of claims made by people in Pakistan about the damage caused by India's air strike.

"Meet such people whose real faces are hidden behind and their false faces are seen," he said, in an apparent dig at the BJP leadership.

Earlier, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had questioned the air strike in Pakistan and demanded proof.
