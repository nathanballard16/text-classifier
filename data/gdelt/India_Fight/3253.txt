AAP realising dreams of forefathers: Arvind Kejriwal

Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal on Friday accused all other political parties of failing the forefathers while asserting only Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has realized the dreams of those who sacrificed their lives for the country. The AAP convenor, while making a veiled attack on the Centre for creating hurdles in Delhi government's work, said that his government has worked like a revolution ever since it came to power in Delhi in 2015.

"If the martyrs knew that this would be the condition of the country after 70 years, they would think before laying down their lives. We know all political parties have failed the country. Today if a poor, or even a middle-class person takes ill, he/she has to spend all his savings," Kejriwal said.

"It is only our government that has realised dreams of our forefathers through our work in Delhi in last four years. Look at the health services we provide. Even the most expensive surgery could be done free at government hospitals," Kejriwal added. The CM used the occasion to launch a veiled attack on PM Modi's government for allegedly creating hurdles in AAP government. "What else is patriotism that setting up Mohalla Clinics for the poor people. By creating hurdles, they (Centre) are committing treason to the country and its people," he said.
