New Delhi fire victims lived and worked in unsafe spaces

NEW DELHI (AP) - Mr Mehboob Alam's phone rang at 5.04am Sunday (Dec 8). It was his 38-year-old nephew, Mohammad Imran, pleading to be saved.

A minute into the call, Imran's voice disappeared. Mr Alam ran toward his nephew in a crowded section of central New Delhi, through the winding labyrinth of dirt lanes, past butcher shops and cart pullers, trailed by other men who had woken up to loud cries for help that echoed from a building on fire.

Imran was in that building.

Overwhelmed by the rising din of sirens and people's screams, Mr Alam bent over to catch his breath and catch a glimpse of the building.

"I knew then and there that Imran wouldn't have made it," he said.

Imran, a father of two, was among the 43 people killed in the factory fire that engulfed the four-storey building.

Most of the victims were Muslim migrant workers from the impoverished border state of Bihar in eastern India, earning as little as 150 rupees (S$2.86) per day making handbags, caps and other garments. When the fire broke out, the workers were asleep between lengthy shifts.

Investigators determined the cause of the fire as an electrical short circuit. Authorities and medics said most of the deaths were due to people inhaling poisonous gases inside the already cramped and dimly lit interiors. The building's owner was detained by police on suspicion of of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Mr Mohammad Naushad, who said he carried at least 10 people out of the flames on his shoulders, was one of the first responders. He said the firemen and other civilian volunteers braved the fire and quickly managed to rescue dozens of survivors.

"But many more could have been saved," Mr Naushad said.

When the fire brigade officers arrived, hundreds of agitated residents were already there, hindering the firemen from reaching the site.
