Complaint filed in Delhi court against Mayawati for hurting religious sentiments through SC affidavit

New Delhi: A plea was filed in the Tis Hazari court here on Wednesday against Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of the Hindu community by comparing herself with Lord Rama.

The petition states that the BSP supremo in her recent affidavit filed before the Supreme Court stated that if the ruling UP government can make tall Idol of Lord Rama in Ayodhya measuring 221 metres by using government fund, then why cannot she make her own Idol.

Metropolitan magistrate Tista Shah has put the matter for consideration on May 1,

Complainant Chhatar Singh Rachhoya stated that these types of sarcastic remark hurt his religious sentiments as Mayawati compared herself with Lord Rama.

“….This type of HALAFTNAMA (affidavit) given by the accused before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India even at the time of election / code of conduct in force therein she compared herself with the adorable Shri Rama, Lord of Hindu religion, it is a clear cut pre-planned conspiracy for disrespecting a religion with a view to take undue advantage for polarization and satisfying some other religion and she wants to create disharmony between communities,” the plea said.

The petition filed under section 156(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 to direct the concerned SHO to register an FIR against her under section 153A and 295A and other appropriate sections of the law.

The BSP supremo in an affidavit before the Supreme Court on April 2, justified statues built in Uttar Pradesh with taxpayers money during her regime.

In February, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had said he was of the tentative view that the BSP chief has to reimburse the taxpayers’ money used in building the statues. But he stopped short of passing an order to hear what Mayawati had to say.

The top court was hearing a petition filed in 2009 against the profusion of statues of Mayawati, her mentor Kanshi Ram and elephants – her party BSP’s symbol – built at parks in Lucknow and Noida with taxpayers’ money when she was the Chief Minister between 2007 and 2012.
