Mamata Claims Her Fight Against PM Modi Is Like 1942 Quit India Movement; Says BJP Will Win Zero Seats In Bengal

West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee has drawn parallels between her political battle to remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power to the Quit India Movement in 1942, reports The New Indian Express.

"Someone has to bell the cat. In 1942, Quit India movement was launched against the British, now we are fighting to oust a fascist Modi from power," Banerjee said while peaking to supporters at a rally in Debra.

The Trinamool supremo also pushed the claim that if Modi came back to power, it would endanger democracy in the country.

"There will be no freedom or democracy in the country if Modi is voted to power again. It is time we show the door to Modi and the BJP. It's time this government is buried during this democratic exercise (elections)," she remarked.

Drawing another comparison from the past, Banerjee asserted that currently an ‘emergency-like situation’ existed in the nation.

She also claimed that minorities were no longer feeling secure in the country as such communities were facing repeated attacks.

Opining that the BJP would not succeed in winning any seats in the current Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, she said that the right wing party would “get a rosgolla (a zero) in Bengal”
