The case relates to ownership of overseas assets worth 1.9 million pounds by Vadra.



On December 7 last year, the ED had searched several of Vadra's properties in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru.



Vadra, who was slated to appear before the ED at its Jamnagar office here on Monday for his sixth round of questioning, has moved a separate plea before the court seeking a stay on his interrogation.



Special Judge Arvind Kumar will hear the plea post lunch.



Vadra, husband of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, is on interim bail till March 2.
