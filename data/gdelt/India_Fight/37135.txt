Unnao rape case: BJP expels accused Kuldeep Sengar

LUCKNOW: A day after CBI registered a case of murder and criminal intimidation of Unnao rape victime against jailed Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar , the BJP expelled the tainted law maker from the party on Thursday.Senger's expulsion from the party was ordered by BJP national working president JP Nadda, two days after the BJP disowned the MLA claiming that he was expelled from the party a year ago.Senior party sources in New Delhi confirmed that party president and home minister Amit Shah had told the state BJP unit to expel the MLA. The development came on a day when the Supreme Court sought transfer of the Unnao case to itself and a day after a CBI probe got under way into the accident suffered by the rape victim, a suspected case of intimidation.BJP sources said that involvement of Sengar in rape of a minor and his alleged conspiracy to orchestrate an accident of the rape victim was sending a wrong message about the party. ``The party had to take a hard step,'' said a senior BJP leader in UP.
