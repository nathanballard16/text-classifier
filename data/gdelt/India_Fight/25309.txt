Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh, son of former Maharashtra Chief Minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh, on Monday replied to Union Minister Piyush Goyal who accused the late politician of being busy with film producers for his actor-son while the deadly 26/11 terrorist attack took place in the city in 2008.

Riteish took the social media and tweeted, "Honourable Minister, It is true that I had visited the Taj/Oberoi but untrue that I was there while the 'Shooting and Bombing' was happening as you claimed. It is true that I had accompanied my father but untrue that he was trying to get me a role in a film."

The actor 'Housefull' famed actor also wrote, "He never ever spoke to a director or a producer to cast me in film & I take pride in that. You have every right to question a CM but it is wrong to accuse someone who is not here to defend himself. A bit late, 7 years ago - He would have replied to you. My best wishes with your campaign Sir. Love & regards, Riteish Vilasrao Deshmukh".

Last week, during an event in Ludhiana, Goyal addressed the business community and said, "You might remember the 26/11 terror attack. The then Congress government was weak and could not do anything. The then chief minister (Vilasrao Deshmukh) had brought a film producer outside Oberoi Hotel while shooting and bombing were going on inside." "The CM was concerned about getting his child a film role," it read.
