Change time of Muharram, not Durga Puja: Yogi Adityanath in Bengal

As tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Trinamool Congress reach an all-time high, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath launched another attack on Mamata Banerjee's party.

Speaking at a rally in Barasat in West Bengal, Yogi Adityanath alleged that the West Bengal government was playing the minority appeasement card.

He said, "In the whole country, Durga Puja and Muharram fell on the same day. In UP, officers asked me, should we change the timing of puja? I said the timing of the puja won't be changed if you want to change the timing, change the timing of Muharram procession."

Reports earlier in the day suggested that the West Bengal Police had not given permission for Yogi Adityanath's rallies in the state.

BJP claimed that Yogi Adityanath's rally in Phool Bagan area of Kolkata was cancelled after the stage was vandalised. The BJP added that the rally decorator was also beaten up.

Sources in the BJP said after the rally stage was damaged, BJP chief Amit Shah instructed Yogi Adityanath to attend all three rallies in Bengal and not back out.
