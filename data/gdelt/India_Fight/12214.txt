“The continuous skirmishes between the two nations have wreaked havoc on the lives of numerous families living on the either sides of divide. Yesterday, number of innocent people including children got killed in cross border shelling on both sides of LoC in Poonch area. People are being forced to relocate to safer areas resulting in large scale migration. It’s time that both nations put an immediate end to such hostilities along LoC and IB areas,” he said.

Farooq while denouncing the option of war said, “Both soldiers and civilians suffer in the times of war. The consequences of war and conflict are beyond killings. I am hopeful that the state of affairs between both the countries is moving towards betterment with each passing day.”

“Besides it is incumbent upon world leaders to impress upon both India and Pakistan to stop hostilities and improve ties,” he added.
