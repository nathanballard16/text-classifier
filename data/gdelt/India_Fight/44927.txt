Bhubaneswar on JeM ‘terror target’

New Delhi:Around 30 cities, including Bhubaneswar, are on the hit list of Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as part of retaliation measures against India’s abrogation of Article 370 provisions of the Constitution providing special status for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

According to sources, the Intelligence Bureau has recovered a threatening letter typed in Hindi by Shamsher Wani, who is stated to be a JeM operative. The content of the letter sets a target of 30 cities to take revenge for abrogating Article 370 for the Jammu and Kashmir. The letter also suggests attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and national security advisor.

Sources further said the letter also claims to launch terror attacks in at least 30 major cities like Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Jaipur, Gandhinagar, Kanpur and Lucknow along with the airports in these cities.

According intelligence inputs available with sources, Bhubaneswar city and airport are among the JeM terror targets.

The intelligence agencies have also issued threat advisories to various security agencies protecting the airports and other institutions across the country.

Earlier, the coast lines of Gujarat, Mumbai and Odisha was put on alert citing the terrorist outfit may target the coastal cities with the help of infiltratators.

However, police DG BK Sharma feigned ignorance about the JeM threat to Bhubaneswar city and airport when asked about the inputs.
