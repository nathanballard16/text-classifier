Pakistan violates ceasefire in Mankote sector of Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch

New Delhi:

Pakistani troops on Saturday resorted to unprovoked firing by violating ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in the Mankote sector of Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district. The gunfight was still underway when the last reports came in and the Indian Army is retaliating strongly and effectively to the heavy mortar shelling, initiated by Pakistan at about 1:30 pm today.

"Jammu and Kashmir: Pakistan violated ceasefire at around 1:30 pm in Mankote sector, Poonch district. Indian Army retaliating," the news agency ANI reported.

However, no casualty has been reported from either side in the cross-border firing till the time.

There has been a spurt in ceasefire violations by Pakistan after India's preemptive air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot on February 26 following the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 42 CRPF personnel were killed.

Four civilians, including three members of a family, were killed and several others injured as Pakistan targeted over 80 villages in more than 100 incidents of ceasefire violations along the LoC in the state since then.

The frequent ceasefire violations have caused panic among the border residents, forcing authorities to close down educational institutions within five km radius from the zero lines in the twin districts of Poonch and Rajouri as a precautionary measure.

However, most schools reopened a few days back after the intensity of the cross-border firing decreased.
