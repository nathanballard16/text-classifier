Three NRIs from Hyderabad, two others killed in tragic road accident in Oman

Three from an NRI family hailing from Hyderabad were killed in a tragic incident in Oman on Friday. The family, based in Dubai, was travelling to Oman for a holiday when their vehicle collided with another vehicle. Three from the family and the two Omani citizens were killed on spot. The accident occurred near Haima in Al-Wusta governorate, on the Dubai-Salala highway, 530 km away from the capital of Muscat.

According to reports, the deceased people have been identified as Ghous Ullah Khan (29), who worked and lived in Dubai, and his wife Ayesha Siddiqua (28) and their eight-month-old child Hamza Khan. Their other daughter, three-year-old Haniya Siddiqua, is critically injured and is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Muscat.

The deceased family belonged to the Salarjung colony in Hyderabad but were originally natives of Warangal. According to the Oman police, the two Omani citizens killed were high-ranking officials of the state. Suwaid Al Shemaisi, who was killed along with his son Saeed Al Semaisi, was the executive director of the Sohar Port, located between Dubai and Muscat.

Responding to pleas from MBT leader Amjadullah Khan in Hyderabad to provide assistance to the family of the deceased, the Indian embassy in Muscat responded saying they were in touch with the family. According to reports, the family had a few relatives living in Dubai who rushed to Muscat after receiving the news of the fatal accident.

“Arrangements are being made to transfer the mortal remains of the deceased to India. The surviving child has been shifted to the Ghoula hospital in Muscat for treatment,” the embassy responded in a statement issued on Saturday.

Haniya, the lone survivor, is said to have multiple head injuries and fractures. The bodies of the deceased are expected to arrive in Hyderabad on Sunday.
