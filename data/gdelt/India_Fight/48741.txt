MUMBAI: A 21-year-old student was arrested on Monday for allegedly murdering his mother’s ‘paramour’.

The accused, Shahbaz Shaikh, suspected that his mother, a 55-year-old, was having an affair with a 37-year-old real estate agent, Pervez Shaikh, said an official from Bandra-Kurla Complex police station.

Around 10.30 pm on Monday, Shahbaz spotted Pervez and his mother at an isolated place. “This annoyed him. In a fit of rage, he clobbered Pervez on the head with a paver block, killing him,” the official said.

Shahbaz was arrested in less than an hour after that.

A police official said that Shahbaz has confessed to the killing.

Pervez had met the woman, who used to sell clothes, five years ago. They got into a partnership in Pervez’s real estate business. Shahbaz’s suspected they were in a relationship as Pervez often visited his house.
