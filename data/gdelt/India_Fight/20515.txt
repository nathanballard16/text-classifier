Earlier, the Supreme Court sent a notice to Congress chief Rahul Gandhi seeking his explanation in a contempt plea regarding the Rafale case. The apex court said that the Congress chief had "wrongly attributed" the SC order on Rafale case to attack PM Modi with a "chowkidar chor hai" jibe at a rally in Amethi. Gandhi has been asked to respond in 7 days.

In the meantime, the word wars between Samajwadi Party's Azam Khan and BJP's Jaya Prada escalated after the former made a crass jibe at the BJP candidate from Rampur by referring to her “khaki underwear” while addressing a rally on Sunday. However, Khan chose to defend his statement saying that his comment had been "distorted" by the media. Although Sushma Swaraj urged SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav to speak up against Khan, the BJP filed an FIR against him. A furious Jaya Prada also lashed out at Khan for "crossing all limits" and vowed to defeat him in the Lok Sabha Election 2019.
