Fire breaks out at garment unit in New Shakti Nagar

Ludhiana: A fire broke out at a garment factory in New Shakti Nagar on Sunday noon. Nobody was injured in the incident.

After receiving a call around 12.05pm, firemen rushed three tenders from central fire station to Okas International. The workers who were inside the unit rushed out as flames engulfed its first floor. The fire did not reach the ground floor of the factory.

Firemen suspect a short circuit triggered the blaze. Even as the factory had fire extinguishers, those proved insufficient.

Sub-fire officer TR Maini said, “While one door of the unit was open, we had to break the locks of the other to shower water from both sides. We had to refill the fire tenders from Sunder Nagar fire station as there was no provision of water in the unit. The unit had not obtained an NOC from the fire department. It took us more than two hours to bring the situation under control.”

Hours before, another such incident was reported from Nanak Nagar where blaze engulfed the first floor of a garment unit — VK Manufacturing — on Saturday night. Here too, the fire-safety arrangements were not up to the mark and the unit had not obtained an NOC from the fire department. The firemen took two hours to douse the flames.
