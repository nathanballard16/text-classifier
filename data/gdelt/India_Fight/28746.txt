INTERNATIONAL

An article on Wednesday about a police raid on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation referred incorrectly to a comment by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, “It never troubles me that our laws are being upheld.” He made the remark on Tuesday when asked about the raid on Annika Smethurst’s home, not on Wednesday in regard to two recent raids targeting journalists.

•

An article on Wednesday about the possible collapse of the Palestinian Authority referred incorrectly to the exclusivity of the interview with Mr. Shtayyeh. It was one of his earliest interviews with a major Western news organization; it was not the first.

NEW YORK

Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about eight people accused of using fake parking placards misstated the age of Adrian Ramprasad. He is 27, not 47.

•

An article on Monday about the arrest of the estranged husband in the disappearance of his wife incorrectly described the couple’s five children. There are three boys and two girls, not four boys and three girls.
