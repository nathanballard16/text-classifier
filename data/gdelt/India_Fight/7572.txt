“If India Attacks, Pakistan Will Retaliate”: Imran Khan amid tension over Pulwama

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan while addressing the media for the first time after the Pulwama attack today said that Pakistan will retaliate if India attacks.

He denied any role of Pakistan in the Pulwama terror attack in which over 40 soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber from Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based terror group.

He stated that “All this attack Pakistan talk is all keeping elections in mind. But if at all these are serious, please make note of one thing clearly that Pakistan will not think of retaliating, it will retaliate.” He added that this issue should be resolved through dialogue

He said that Pakistan is open to any investigation in the attack “It is in our interest that nobody from our soil spreads violence. I want to tell Indian govt that we will take action if evidence is found against anyone from Pakistan,” he added.

Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad was behind the deadliest terror attack on security forces in Kashmir in which 49 CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday when their convoy was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway.
