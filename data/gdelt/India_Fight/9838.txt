India strikes inside Pakistan after deadly Kashmir attack

Balakot police chief Saghir Hussain Shah said he had sent teams to the area where the Indian bombs reportedly hit, which he described as a mostly deserted wooded area. "There are no casualties, there are no damages on the ground," he said. There was no immediate explanation for the differing accounts, but India and Pakistan routinely contradict one another.
