Story India: Daikin workers seriously injured during two-day national strike





In January 2019, approximately 30 workers at the Daikin India factory were reported to have been seriously injured while participating in a two-day national strike. Twelve workers were subseqently arrested on charges of rioting and attempted murder, with an additional 700 unnamed workers being charged with the same offences. The workers alleged that “bouncers” hired by Daikin “pelted [them with] stones” and “fired rubber bullets on them”. They further reported that the violent response was “aimed at dismissing the union.”

The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre invited Daikin India and it's parent company, Daikin Global, to respond to the above allegations. No response was received.
