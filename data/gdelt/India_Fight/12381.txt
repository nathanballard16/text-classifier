Irrfan Khan is completely FINE now and will soon begin Hindi Medium 2 shoot, says Tigmanshu Dhulia

Talented and celebrated actor Irrfan Khan had left us all shocked after he announced that he was diagnosed with cancer last year. However, in a good news, the actor is now back in India and completely fine, confirmed director-producer Tigmanshu Dhulia. The director-producer also confirmed that Irrfan will begin shooting for Hindi Medium 2 soon. The shooting for the sequel was to start last year in August but was pushed due to Irrfan's treatment.

In an interview to Deccan Chronicle, Tigmanshu was quoted saying, “I did meet him after he returned to India. He is perfectly fine now. Irrfan told me that he will begin shooting for Hindi Medium franchise soon.” About collaborating with Irrfan, he added, "We will do a film soon. Actually, we were in the process of writing one for him. Probably, if everything goes well, we shall be making the film soon."

It was reported that whilst seeking treatment in the UK, the actor had returned to India for two days for a puja. In March 2018, Irrfan announced that he had been diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumour. "Learning that I am suffering from NeuroEndocrine Tumour has been tough but the love and strength of people around me have brought me to a place of hope," his statement read.

Hindi Medium starred Irrfan opposite Pakistani actor Saba and was a sleeper hit.
