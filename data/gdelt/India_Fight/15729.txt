Katrina Kaif’s gift to herself is a luxury SUV that costs a bomb; Read to know more

While Bollywood actors often work very hard to reach a high point of success, many of them also know how to spend the hard earned money on themselves from time to time. Some might indulge in a vacation with their loved ones, while others might spend on their home. Speaking of this, Katrina Kaif seems to have gifted herself a brand new luxury SUV to reward her hard work. Katrina already owns an Audi and is often seen travelling in the city in it.

However, as per a report in Mid-day, Katrina gifted herself a new Luxury SUV- a range rover. Not just this, Katrina got the number of the car in the same series as her previous SUV with the number 8822. The Zero actor is known to be one of the most hard-working ladies in the business and always puts her best foot forward for her projects. Amidst all of the hard work, Katrina got herself a well-deserved gift in the form of this new vehicle.

While the car is super swanky and is white in colour, the cost of the Range Rover might leave you shocked. Katrina Kaif’s brand new Range Rover costs in a range of Rs 49 to 65 Lakhs. Now, that surely is an expensive yet well-deserved gift for the Zero actress.
