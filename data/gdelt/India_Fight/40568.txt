Mother-son killed as car crashes into stationary truck

Ludhiana: A 69-year-old woman and her son from Amritsar were killed while three members of their family were seriously injured after their car crashed into a stationary truck near Sahnewal on the Delhi-Ludhiana National Highway on Thursday morning.

Satinder Kaur, a resident of Vijay Nagar, Batala Road, Amritsar, along with her family was returning to Amritsar after dropping her Canada-bound granddaughter to New Delhi airport.

Satinder and her 48-year-old son Darshan Singh, a cattle feed trader, were killed on the spot. Darshan’s wife Simranjit Kaur, 45; son Harmanpreet Singh, 20; and niece Jivisha (12) were injured in the accident and were admitted to SBS Hospital, Sherpur Chowk. The condition of Harmanpreet and Jivisha is stated to be critical.

Sources said Darshan’s daughter Harsimran Kaur had a flight to Canada early Thursday morning. The entire family had gone to drop her at Delhi airport in their Honda car.

Inspector Inderjit Singh, SHO, Sahnewal police station, said Darshan was driving the car while his mother was sitting beside him and three others were on the rear seats. At around 5.30am, when the family reached Sahnewal flyover near a popular dhaba, it crashed into a container truck which was parked on road with a flat tyre. The impact of collision was so strong that the car was severely damaged.

The truck driver escaped from the spot following the accident. While Darshan and his mother Satinder died on the spot, the injured were rushed to hospital by passersby.

Darshan’s brother Hardev Singh said Harsimran was going to Canada on a study visa. “The entire family was excited and happy for her. My daughter Jivisha also insisted to go with them to the Delhi airport.”

The Sahnewal police have registered a case against unidentified driver and are trying to trace him with the help of the registration number of truck.
