Miscreants shot dead bank customer service point operator

Armed miscreants shot dead a bank's customer service point (CSP) operator when he resisted their attempt to loot Rs 5 lakh that he was carrying in Bihar's Gaya district on Monday, police said.

The miscreants shot dead 25-year-old Mohammad Rashid near Alalpur village under the jurisdiction of Bodhgaya police station of the district, Bodhgaya Deputy Superintendent of Police Sindhu Shekhar Singh said.

The incident occurred when Rashid along with his friend Sandeep were on their way to a Bank of Baroda branch located at Kariyadpur after collecting money from Gaya, the DSP said.

The deceased and his friend Sandeep are the residents of Kariyadpur village.

Sandeep told the police that six miscreants riding two bikes overtook them and stopped their bike. The miscreants shot at Rashid as he resisted their bid to snatch the bag containing the money that he was carrying, a police officer said.

Sandeep said that the criminals also fired at him but he somehow managed to escape from the spot, sources said.

Angry villagers blocked the Bodhgaya-Fatehpur road with the body to protest the murder. Police reached the spot and pacified them to lift the blockade.

The body was sent Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital, Gaya for postmortem, the officer added.
