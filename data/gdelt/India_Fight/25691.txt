A soldier and three terrorists were killed today in a gunfight in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir in India, police said.

Two soldiers and a civilian have also been injured in the encounter.

Based on a tip-off, security forces including Rashtriya Rifles (RR), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the state police started a cordon and search operation in Dalipora village.

The terrorists holed up in a house in the Dalipora area fired at the security forces which triggered the gunfight.

Search operation is underway.

"Identity of the slain terrorists was being ascertained. The operation is still going on," police said

Meanwhile, there were also reports of clashes between stone pelting protesters and the security forces near the gunfight site despite authorities announcing curfew-like restrictions in the area.

As a precautionary measure, authorities have suspended mobile Internet services in Pulwama.

Mobile internet speed has also been brought down in Srinagar city to prevent uploading of inflammatory pictures and posts.

Meanwhile, a 23-year-old youth, injured in clashes with the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district earlier this week, died at a hospital early today.
