Prashant Kishor hits back at Chandrababu naidu, dubs allegations as baseless

New Delhi [India], Mar 19 (ANI): Poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Tuesday took a dig at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu after the latter called him a 'Bihari dacoit and accused him of removing lakhs of votes of TDP sympathizers.

“An imminent defeat can rattle even the most seasoned politicians. So I’m not surprised with the baseless utterances of @ncbn. Sirji rather than using derogatory language that shows your prejudice & malice against Bihar, just focus on why people of AP should vote for you again,” Kishor tweeted.

On Monday, Naidu accused Kishor of removing names of lakhs on voter in his state while addressing an event in Ongole city in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh.

"K Chandrashekar Rao is doing criminal politics. He is grabbing the MLAs of Congress and TDP. Bihari dacoit Prasant Kishore has removed lakhs of votes in Andhra Pradesh. He is committing cyber crime," Chief Minister Naidu said.

Earlier, Naidu had criticized YSR Congress Party chief Jaganmohan Reddy along with TRS and BJP for removing the names of voters from the list.

The chief minister had also alleged Prashant Kishor's role in the IT raids and accused him of giving 'criminal advice' to YSR Congress.

Kishor is credited with devising successful political campaigns for Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Gujarat assembly polls in 2012. He also conceptualised advertising campaigns and marketing strategies like Manthan and Chai pe Charcha for Modi in 2014.

Kishor, who hails from Bihar, had also worked with Nitish Kumar during the 2015 Bihar assembly election. He formally joined the JD(U) in 2018.

The 17th Lok Sabha polls and the Assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh will take place on April 11 in a single phase. The results of the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls will be announced on May 23. (ANI)
