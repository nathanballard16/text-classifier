Tout held for duping Canadian woman in Delhi

A 33-year-old member of an active gang of touts in the Connaught Place area was arrested here for cheating a Canadian woman after posing as a government authorised travel agent offering customised tour packages, a police officer said on Wednesday.

"Idrees Shamshad Bhat was arrested on Tuesday from his residence in south Delhi's Jangpura area after a police raid following a tip off," Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Madhur Verma said.

"A native of Srinagar, Bhat had on March 18 cheated a Canadian national, Jonrong Wang, by misleading her by posing as a government authorised agent," Verma said.

"He offered Wang customised tour packages in India. Wang had booked a luxury trip to Rajasthan and was asked to pay huge amount of money in advance. Bhat took all money but later did not deliver the tour package," he added.

"The victim filed a police complaint of cheating against Bhat on March 20," Verma said, adding that two other accomplices of Bhat have been identified who were still at large.

"During interrogation, Bhat said he had been cheating foreign tourists in Delhi since 2007. He along with his accomplices would lure innocent foreign tourists by offering them attractive and customised tour packages and then collect all the money in advance without delivering ont their promise," Verma said.
