Countries Close to Afghanistan Must Fight IS: Trump

KABUL - US President Donald Trump wants India, Iran, Russia and Turkey to fight against terrorists in Afghanistan.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said the job against terrorism was being done only by the US, some 7,000 miles away and the countries closer to Afghanistan were not putting up the fight.

“At a certain point Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey are going to have to fight their battles too. We have wiped out the caliphate 100 per cent.” International media quoted him as saying..

“I did it in record time but at a certain point all of these other countries. where ISIS is (still) around…” Trump said while responding to a question on the reemergence of ISIS in Afghanistan.

All of these countries are going to have to fight the group, as the US could not afford to stay in Afghanistan for another 19 years, according to Trump.

“I don’t think so. So, at a certain point other countries, including Russia, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India will have to battle the Islamic State,” he reiterated.

The comments come a day after Trump indicated the US forces would not completely withdraw from the war-torn country and America would make sure the Taliban do not regain control. (Pajhwok)
