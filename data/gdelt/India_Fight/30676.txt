New Delhi: Days after a Kerala woman Police officer was burnt alive by a fellow cop, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has sought a report from state police in the matter. The 34-year-old cop Soumya Pushpakaran set ablaze by a fellow cop in Mavelikara area of Alappuzha district.

The NCW has expressed shock and dismay over the murder of the police officer and asked Kerala police to file a detailed report to the commission.

The accused, identified as Ajas, has been recuperating in hospital. He received 40 per cent burn injuries during the attack on the woman, a mother of three. The accused is under police custody.

According to a report in PTI, the accused had been forcing the woman to marry him despite she being married and having three children. However, police say that the motive of the attack could be ascertained only after the interrogation of the accused.

The incident occurred on Saturday when the victim police officer was returning home after work. The accused, who is a traffic policeman, first knocked Pushpakaran off from her two-wheeler and then attacked her with a machete. The woman tried to escape the attack by taking refuge at a nearby house, but Ajas followed her and set her ablaze by pouring petrol on her. Pushpakaran reportedly died on the spot.
