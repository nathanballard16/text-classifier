Two shot dead in Ghaziabad for resisting robbery

Two persons were shot dead and one other was critically wounded for resiting a robbery in Ghaziabad's Loni in the early hours of Monday, police said.

The robbers also got away with cash and valuables worth over Rs 3 lakh, they said.

A provision store owner, Dharmavir Sharma, and his neighbour Sonu were killed during the robbery that took place in Pooja Colony under Tronica City police station limits around 3 am, they said.

SP (Rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said six armed robbers reached the provision store where the owner, Sharma, was sleeping outside the shop as his house is under construction and the store shutter was partly opened because of its ramshackle condition.

One of the robbers asked Sharma to fetch him a glass of water. When Sharma entered the house, they also barged inside and overpowered the whole family and robbed them of Rs 70,000 in cash and gold ornaments worth around Rs 3 lakh.

When Sharma and his son resisted them, the robbers shot at the store owner twice. While the robbers were fleeing along with the valuables after killing Sharma, Ashok Verma and his two sons Sonu and Babu caught hold of one of the accused.

The robbers fired at them due which Sharma, Sonu and Babu suffered serious gunshot injuries, police said. The injured were rushed to a nearby hospital where Sharma and Sonu were declared brought dead, they said, adding critically injured Babu is undergoing treatment.

The case is being probed keeping in view the robbers' modus operandi, the SP said.
