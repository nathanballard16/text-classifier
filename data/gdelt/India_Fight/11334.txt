Pakistan To Release Indian Air Force Pilot

The Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman will be released by Pakistan on Friday, reports said.

Wing Commander Abhinandan will be received at the Wagah border on Friday evening, as per reports.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Wing Commander Varthaman will be released as a “gesture of peace”.

It is not clear whether the pilot will be handed over to the International Red Cross or to the Indian authorities by Pakistan.

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG 21 was shot during aerial combat between India and Pakistan on Wednesday morning.

According to India’s NDTV report, India had rejected Imran Khan’s call on Thursday for dialogue, saying there would be “no deal” on the Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s release.

Amid soaring tension, the Indian government demanded the “immediate and safe return” of the pilot and said it “would be well-advised to ensure that no harm comes to him”.

Tensions between the two countries escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed’s training camp near Balakot on Thursday.
