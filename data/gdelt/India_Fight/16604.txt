Country is unsafe in the hands of Congress weak leadership: Piyush Goyal

HYDERABAD: Union minister for railways Piyush Goyal said the country will be unsafe in the hands of weak and immature leadership (referring to Rahul Gandhi) of Congress. He said the Congress party was politically oriented towards votes, not any national interest. Reacting on the chairman of the Overseas Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda 's remarks on the Balakot air strikes, the Union minister said his comments exposed the mindset of the Congress party leaders."Close aide of Congress president Rahul Gandhi and close friend of Rajiv Gandhi Sam Pitroda comments and attitude on the air strikes is totally diplorable. Pitroda insulting the Indian security forces and says terror attacks like 26/11 in Mumbai `somethings happen' and only eight people did it. Congress party should be ashamed on this," he said.Addressing group of intellectuals, party leaders and workers at #MainBhiChowkidar, the Union minister said people have made up their mind that the country is safe in the hands of leaders like Narendra Modi , who has been strong and decisive leader and resolved to defeat the party which play divisive role and anti-national in the Lok Sabha elections.He said the NDA government had never compromised on the national security issues. "Had the then PM taken some stringent measures like giving befitting lesson to Pakistan based terror groups, the situation like Pulwama should not have happened," he said.The Union minister said the country has been registering growth for the past four years from a fragile economy and now emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. In the coming days, the country would become superpower and global power, he said. "Now during the NDA government, the governance is totally corruption free and transparent," Goyal said.Prime Minister Modi is a real chowkidar for the country and people should also become chowkidar in their respective fields.BJP state president K Laxman, MP Bandaru Dattatreya, Malkajgiri and Secunderabad BJP candidates N Ramchander Rao and G Kishan Reddy were present.
