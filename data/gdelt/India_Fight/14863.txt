Pakistan journalist compares Masood Azhar to Dalai Lama, Twitter users ask 'are you serious?'

Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir gave the reason behind China's move to block listing of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

Pakistan journalist Hamid Mir gave a far-fetched reason behind China's move to block listing of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. However, in his attempt to justify the mover, he ended up comparing Azhar to Tibetan spiritual lead Dalai Lama.

China prevented another bid to list Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), as a global terrorist in the UN Security Council committee. This is the fourth time China has blocked such a bid in the committee.

India had pushed the latest bid to blacklist Azhar after JeM attacked a CRPF convoy in Pulwama last month. The February 14 attack that killed at least 40 paramilitary personnel was the deadliest in Kashmir.

The United States, Britain, and France asked the Security Council's Islamic State and al Qaeda sanctions committee to subject JeM founder Masood Azhar to an arms embargo, travel ban and asset freeze. The 15-member committee operates by consensus.

China placed a "technical hold" on the request, according to a note from its U.N. mission to the committee, seen by Reuters. China gave no reason for the hold, which places the request in limbo.

While it is clear that China has blocked the move to please its all-weather friend Pakistan, some people in Pakistan were busy finding other 'justifications' for the move.

One such justification came from Pakistan journalist Hamid Mir who explained China's move to block listing of Masood Azhar as global terrorist as a response to India giving shelter to Dalai Lama.
