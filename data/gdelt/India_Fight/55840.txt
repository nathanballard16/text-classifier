Mumbai’s suitcase murder accused a minor

MUMBAI: In a twist in the body parts-in-suitcase investigation, the prime accused in the murder of guitarist Bennett Rebello (55) has turned out to be a minor . Till the finding — courtesy the accused’s birth certificate and Aadhaar card — the girl’s age was believed to be 19 years. Police said the two documents show she was born on July 21, 2002 and is thus almost 17-and-a-half years old.On Sunday, the Esplanade court magistrate asked the police to produce her before the Juvenile Justice Board. The police are considering the option of going in for bone ossification and other age-determining tests to verify if her stated age is correct. Such tests were performed in the Shakti Mills gangrape case.On December 2, a suitcase containing a few of Rebello’s body parts was found behind Mahim Dargah. Labels from pieces of clothing in it helped the police identify the body. Five days later, the crime branch arrested the girl and her 16-year-old boyfriend for killing the guitarist, whose body was chopped into pieces, kept in three suitcases and dumped in a river. The girl was Rebello’s adopted daughter.
