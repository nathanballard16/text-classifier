Apple orchard talk keeps Delhi cops on toes

At an apple orchard in Bandipore of Kashmir, a Jaish-e-Mohammed commander recently told his supporters that there would be "big attacks in Jammu and Delhi", this newspaper has learnt.



"Our brothers have already reached these places," JeM terrorist Abu Usman told the gathering five to six days back, according to intelligence sources. The information has been shared with multiple agencies, said sources in Delhi police. One Pakistani and two Kashmiri terrorists carrying an AK-47, pistol and grenades were present at the meeting with Usman, who too flaunted a sniper rifle, said agencies.



Ever since the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories, Pakistan has been desperate to push terrorists into India. Intelligence agencies have time and again alerted the local and central governments about such threats.



Meanwhile, Delhi has been on a high alert following a warning from the Intelligence Bureau that Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba and JeM might target the city during the festive season. The agencies have told the city cops that a few terrorists might have sneaked into the national capital, said sources.



The alert prompted a special team of the police to raid nearly 10 locations in Delhi on Wednesday, though the night-long search didn't yield anything suspicious. "The searches and anti-terror measures are being taken as inputs from intelligence agencies are taken very seriously," said a source. A Delhi police officer said, "We had the information that some Jaish-e-Mohammed have entered Delhi. So we involved the special cell."
