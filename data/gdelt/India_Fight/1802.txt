Four Police Officials In MP Deputy Speaker Convoy Die In Truck Accident

Bhopal: At least four people were killed early on Monday when a speeding truck hit the convoy of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Deputy Speaker in Balaghat district, police said.

The accident took place just after midnight when Deputy Speaker Hina Kawre was returning to Lanji from the district headquarters. The victims included a police Sub-Inspector, a Head Constable, a Constable and the vehicle's driver.

The Congress legislator Hina Kawre was chosen deputy Speaker of the state assembly through a voice vote on Thursday despit opposition protests that the election was “undemocratic and unconstitutional.”

Another police official was injured and was in critical condition, the police added. Kawre told the media on Monday morning that her vehicle had a narrow escape from being hit by the truck coming from the opposite direction. (IANS)
