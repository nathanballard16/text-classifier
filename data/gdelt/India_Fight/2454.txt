Scholar’s remarks against Army evokes sharp protests

DHARWAD: Derogatory remarks by scholar Shiva Vishwanathan against the personnel in the Indian defence forces evoked sharp protests from the audience at a session on ‘ Nationalism ’ on the second day of Dharwad Sahitya Sambhrama here on Saturday.Professor Shiva, while elaborating on the need to erase borders and remove compartmentalisation of nations on political considerations said there is a need to encourage free trade and exchange of ideas in the era of globalisation and also for world peace. However, his remarks that the border between India and Pakistan should be removed and free trade be allowed, led to murmurs among the audience.Further, Shiva accused Indian Army personnel of raping Muslim women along the India-Pakistan border and behaving in an atrocious manner.The audience were showing utmost tolerance when, all along his speech, Shiva Vishwanathan was making veiled attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Hindutva and RSS ideology. However, they stood up and strongly protested his remarks on Indian Army personnel.Additional commissioner of public instruction, Major (retired) Siddalingayya Hiremath stood up and said Prof Shiva should not have generalised his allegations against the Indian Army.He was supported by others among the audience including Lt General (retired) S C Sardeshpande, who had led the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka.Writer Neela asked why the speaker was not saying anything about the atrocities on Kashmiri Pandits, attack on Mumbai by Pakistan sponsored terrorists and the Mughal invasion on India.While the audience, after peacefully listening to what Professor Siva was telling, raised objections during the question-answer session, one of the ‘progressive’ writers took objection to Major Hiremath’s observations.K V Akshara, who was moderating the session and linguist Ganesh Devy sought to bring down the situation under control and ended the session abruptly.Earlier, Professor Shiva began his address on ‘Nationalism: Altercations in Contemporary Situation’ by saying he would call himself n ‘anti nationalist’ as that way of presenting himself would make him ‘Indian’. He said patriotism that took shape during the British rule should not be likened or seen in the same light as that of patriotism of the 21st century as beliefs and notions changed with time.“India should identify itself as the cradle of the biggest ancient civilisation rather than hanging on to the most restricted mind set of nationalism. There is a need for developing the practice of asking questions in a democratic manner,” he said.Shiv said nationalism revolved around country’s citizenship and borders. More interactions and debates would throw light on new angles of history and also help in understanding plurality and diversity of the country, he said.
