Mother, two daughters killed when car hit by train in Surat Thani

Police said the accident happened at a rail crossing in front of the Tambon Phun Phin Administrative Organization that is located between Maluan and Thung Pho railway stations.

The car was hit by the Bangkok-Yala train.

Police said Amornrat Suator, 34, was killed behind the wheel and Saranporn Phadthong, 7, and Supatcha Phadthong, 4, died at the Phun Pin Hospital.

Amornrat's sister told police that Amornrat was sending her elder sister for special tuition and she might not have been familiar with the road that has a rail crossing without barriers.

Train passengers told police that the train driver used a horn to signal the car to move off the rails before the crash.

Surat Thani provincial governor Witchuwit Jinto said he instructed officials to improve visibility by cutting trees and tall grass near the rail crossing.

The governor said he would cooperate with the State Railway of Thailand to find measures to prevent more accidents because the same train hit a pickup truck in Surat Thani's Tha Chana district on January 22, killing two people.
