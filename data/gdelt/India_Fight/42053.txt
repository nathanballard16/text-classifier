Kriti too shared her picture with Lord Ganesha:

It didn’t take long for Kartik to realize that Kriti had shared the same picture with Bappa after cropping him out!

So he mockingly commented on her picture, “Why did you cut me out.”

To this, Kriti replied, “Because you cut me out in your post.”

Fans indeed had gala time watching the both pulling each other’s leg.

Joining the fun was none other ace fashion designer Manish Malhotra, as he commented, “I love the chat you’ll see having about cutting each others pic.”

The pictures which the Kartik and Kriti shared were taken last year from the sets of their film Luka Chuppi.
