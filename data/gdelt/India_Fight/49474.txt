J&K: Massive Search Operation Launched After Terrorists Kill Five Non-Kashmiri Labourers In Kulgam District

In a dastardly attack, terrorists killed five non-Kashmiri labourers in Kulgam district of Valley on Tuesday (29 October), while leaving one seriously injured, reports India Today.

All of the killed labourers hailed from Murshidabad of West Bengal, and were employed in the Valley as masons. They were constructing a house in Kulgam's Katarsu region when the attack happened. It should be noted that Katarsu is known to be dominated by operatives of the Pakistan-backed Hizbul Mujahideen.

Following the killing, the security forces have launched a massive search operation. Additional security forces have also been called in for the operation.

It should be noted that following the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370, the terrorists have been particularly targeting truck drivers and labourers who come into the valley from other parts of the country.

Also, the latest attack comes on the same day when a delegation of the European Parliamentarians was on a visit to J&K to assess the ground situation in the Valley.
