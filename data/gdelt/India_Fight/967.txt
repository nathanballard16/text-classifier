International community should pressurize India to stop violating ceasefire agreements:

Dr. Muhammad Khan (IR Expert):

It is very unfortunate that India is continuously and deliberately targeting innocent civilians at Loc. India is a terrorist state and committing human rights violations at working borders. The civilians living at working border are suffering due to Indian’s troop’s aggressions. India has failed to control situation in occupied Kashmir and displays its frustration through such cheap tactics. A UN report has badly exposed Indian atrocities and human rights violations in Held valley. International community should pressurize India to stop violating ceasefire agreements.
