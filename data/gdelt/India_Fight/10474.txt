Modi should take the olive Branch of IK

[/QUOTE]these poor soliders on the LOC border get down on their knees, cut grass for the population on our side and barters it for food/grain. This is a fact. My friend and others used to barter all the times as their land was right next to the LOC. Those on their high horse don't need to believe it but do go there and ask the people actually on both sides. They are the witnesses to this fact.#fuck2030
