Bharat bandh day 1 highlights: Train services disrupted in Kerala; sporadic violence in Bengal, Rajasthan

The nationwide strike by 10 central trade unions evoked a mixed response on Tuesday as five states, including Kerala, Odisha and Assam, witnessed complete bandh while scattered incidents of violence were reported in West Bengal and Rajasthan.

Banking and postal services were affected across the country as a section of employees abstained from work, according to reports from various parts of the country. Commuters in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Mumbai and West Bengal faced problems as the transport services were hit. Buses went off roads and train services were also disrupted. Workers’ body CITU said around 20 crore workers from all sectors of the economy have participated in the strike across the country. The expanse and active participation of workers in the two-day strike which began Tuesday is a clear indication of the extent of their anger and resentment against the policies of the government, PTI reported the union as saying.

The Central trade unions called a two-day Bharat bandh on Tuesday and Wednesday to protest against the policies for workers adopted by the Narendra Modi-led Union government. The unions have the support of almost all major independent federations of central employees, state employees and the employees of banks, insurance, telecom, and other service sectors.
