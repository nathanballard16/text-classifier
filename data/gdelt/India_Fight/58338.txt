Carlos Ghosn, Brexit, Cyprus: Your Tuesday Briefing

A Lebanese newspaper reported that Mr. Ghosn arrived in Lebanon on a private jet from Turkey. In a statement, released this morning, he said he would “no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system.”

“I have not fled justice — I have escaped injustice and political persecution,” he added.

The circumstances under which he left Japan were unclear. He had posted bail of $9 million, had been required to surrender his passport and was under close watch by the authorities.

Background: Mr. Ghosn, the architect of Nissan’s alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, has been accused by Japanese authorities of underreporting his compensation and shifting personal financial losses to Nissan. He has strongly maintained his innocence.

What’s next: Mr. Ghosn is a citizen of Lebanon, where he is legally protected from extradition, as well as of France and Brazil. He said in his statement that he was now able to “communicate freely with the media” and that he looked forward to “starting next week.”
