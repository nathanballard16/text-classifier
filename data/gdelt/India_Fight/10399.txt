Earlier today, the Pakistan Army claimed that it shot down two aircraft of Indian Air Force (IAF) and arrested their respective pilots. The claim was made by Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor. However, Indian media has rejected the claims made by Pakistan alleging that they were peddling fake news.

The meeting has been called in the wake of an air strike by India Air Force on the terror camps of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs in a press briefing confirmed that an IAF pilot was missing.
