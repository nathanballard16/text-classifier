Yeddyurappa’s comment on air strikes leaves BJP red-faced

BJP Karnataka president and former chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has embarrassed the party by stating that Wednesday’s air strike would guarantee his (BJP) party 22 seats from Karnataka.

He faced severe backlash for this statement from the Opposition and his his own party. Minister of State for External Affairs and former Indian army chief Gen VK singh tweeted: “@BSYBJP ji, I beg to differ. We stand as one nation, action taken by our government is to safeguard our nation and ensure safety of our citizens, not to win a few extra seats.”

Yeddyurappa’s remark at a time when the party is alleging the opposition parties of politicising the air strikes and has launched a attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pulwama attack.

Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy said: “The entire nation is united in supporting the central govt & our armed forces to fight terrorism, while #Bjp leader @BSYBJP is busy calculating how many extra LS seats the terror attack & Pak war can bring to his party. It’s shameful to exploit our jawans’ sacrifice for electoral gains.”

On realising his folly, Yeddyurappa tweeted: “I would like to clarify that my yesterday’s statement has been completely misinterpreted. I have the highest regard for our armed forces. I salute the bravery of our men in fighting for the country’s safety.”

He further said “My statement is being reported out of context. I said that ‘situation is favourable for the BJP’, which I am saying for last couple of months.”

Former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah too joined the bandwagon to condemn Yeddyurappa and said: “Shocking & disgusting to understand #BJPsPlot4Vote. It is unfortunate that @BJP4India is calculating electoral gains even before the dust has settled. No patriot shall derive such sadistic gains over soldiers’ death, only a anti-nationalist can. What will the RSS say about this?”
