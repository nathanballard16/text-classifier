Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu will be producing the upcoming war - hero biopic Major, which is based on the real - life story of Sandeep Unnikrishnan, an NSG Commando who was martyred while rescuing the hostages during the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai. Although Mahesh will be producing the film, but Sandeep's character will be played by the South actor Adivi Sesh. This has obviously left many of his fans disappointed.
