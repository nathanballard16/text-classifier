3,749 killed in Maoists violence in 10 states in 9 years: MHA

New Delhi: Over 3,700 people were killed in Naxal violence in 10 states, the highest in Chhattisgarh, in the last nine years, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in its annual report.

In its report for 2018-19, the ministry said the CPI (Maoist) continues to be the most potent among various LWE outfits in the country and responsible for more than 88 per cent of the total violent incidents and resultant deaths.

“Amidst increasing reverses, the CPI (Maoist) has been making efforts to expand to new areas along the inter-state borders without any significant success,” the report said.

As many as 3,749 people lost their lives in 10,660 incidents of violence in 10 states since 2010, the report said.

The highest number of casualties due to the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) took place in Chhattisgarh where 1,370 people were killed in 3,769 violent incidents perpetrated by the Maoists between 2010 and 2018.

Altogether 997 people were killed in 3,358 LWE violence in Jharkhand in last nine years while 387 people lost their lives in 1,526 similar violent incidents in Bihar during the same period.

The 10 Naxal-hit states are Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

“Resolute implementation of the national policy and action plan by the government has resulted in significant improvement in the LWE scenario across the country. Last five years have seen a significant decline in LWE violence as well as the geographical spread of LWE,” the report, made available on Friday, said.

The declining trend in LWE violence continued in 2018 as well. There has been an overall 26.7 per cent reduction in violent incidents — 1,136 incidents in 2013 to 833 incidents in 2018 — and 39.5 per cent reduction in LWE related deaths — 397 deaths in 2013 to 240 deaths in 2018.

The casualties to security forces declined by 10.7 per cent — 75 deaths in 2013 to 67 deaths in 2018 — and the number of LWE cadres eliminated went up by 65.4 per cent — 136 in 2013 to 225 in 2018.
