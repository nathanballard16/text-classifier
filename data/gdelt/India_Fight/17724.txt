8 killed, 30 injured in Noida bus accident

Noida/Lucknow: Eight passengers, including a minor and two women, were killed and 30 injured when a privately-operated bus rammed into a tanker on the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida on Friday morning, officials said.

The bus was en route Delhi from Uttar Pradesh’s Jalaun district when the incident occurred at 5 am under Rabupura police station limits, they said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath condoled the deaths, while top officials of Gautam Buddh Nagar, including District Magistrate B N Singh and police chief Vaibhav Krishna, rushed to meet the victims in hospital.

Police Circle Officer, Jewar, Sharat Chandra Sharma said, “Eight people were killed and 30 injured in the incident. The victims were rushed to the nearby Kailash Hospital in Jewar. The speeding bus rammed into a tanker which was moving relatively slowly.”

“The exact cause of the incident is yet to be confirmed, but prima facie it appears the driver was drowsy,” Sharma told PTI.

Three women and three children were among the injured. (PTI)
