He entered politics during his student days at the age of 13. As a student, he fought against the British rule. He was suspended from Sri Rama Varma High School after he earned the wrath of authorities,.

In 1947, he was expelled from Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, for protesting against the call to hoist Kochi royal flag along with the Indian flag.

Jail term

Mr. Menon served a three-year jail term for various political reasons, including the Edappally police station attack case in 1950.

He went underground for more than two years after the police station attack had left two policemen dead, triggering brutal police action across central Kerala.

The police station was attacked by a group of young Communists in protest against the police action against communists following the ban imposed on its activities in the country.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan were among those who condoled the death of Mr. Menon. People from various walks of life paid homage to the departed leader.
