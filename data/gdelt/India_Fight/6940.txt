Amid tension between India and Pakistan over the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, there are reports that Islamabad is relocating the terrorists from launchpads near the Line of Control fearing another ‘surgical strike.’ According to a Times of India report, Islamabad has been anticipating a strong action from New Delhi.

The forces behind this act of terrorism and those responsible for it, will be definitely be punished,” he said. “If our neighbour which is totally isolated in the world thinks it can destabilise India through its tactics and conspiracies, then it is making a big mistake,” PM Modi said without naming Pakistan.
