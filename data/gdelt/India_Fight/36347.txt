Kargil war changed world's view about India: Modi

"We foiled Pakistan's deception in Kargil... This war changed the perception of the world towards India... We exposed the deceitful plans of Pakistan to re-draw the Line of Control (LoC). The world witnessed that we never initiated any act of violence and instead gave a befitting reply," Modi said.
