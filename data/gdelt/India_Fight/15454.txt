Who will save the country if there are 'Chowkidars' like Modi: Scindia's jibe on PM

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the BJP's 'Main Bhi Chowkidar' poll campaign, Congress general secretary in-charge of western Uttar Pradesh Jyotiraditya Scindia took a jibe at the Prime Minister on Sunday asking who would save the country if 'Chowkidars' are like him.

Addressing the media here, Scindia said, "In Prime Minister Modi's rule a new environment of corruption has been created in the country. Rafale corruption has never been answered. The government is not answering the question lingering around Rafale. He is not answering why the cost of a jet was increased or why the number of jets was reduced. There is a long list of misdeeds and lies of PM Modi-Corruption, destroying the Make in India scheme, giving away the country's treasury to a businessman. If there will be Chowkidars like him then who will save the country?"

He further accused the Prime Minister of taking control of ministries. "PM Modi ji always says that Congress has not done this and that in the last 70 years. I would say, yes, we have never taken control of any other ministries. The defence ministry has itself admitted that the Prime Minister Office has taken control over the Defence ministry and is taking all the decision," he added.

Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav opined that the voices of those who have been forced to take up the profession of a security guard (chowkidaar) due to lack of jobs must be heard.
