Maldives ex-pres calls on Pakistan to combat against terrorism

Former president of Maldives Mohamed Nasheed has stated that Pakistan needs to stand up against terrorism in order to establish peace across the southern Asia.



In a tweet published on Monday, Nasheed said that peace in South Asia can only be achieved if Pakistan takes action against terror groups operating from their territory.



Nasheed's statement comes at a time when the hostility between Pakistan and India has escalated due to an air-attack launched by India into Pakistan territory. Following the attack, two military jets of India were shot down by Pakistan while one Indian pilot was taken captive.



However, as a "white-flag", Pakistan has since released the captured wing Commander of the Indian Air-force.



The Maldives has called upon Pakistan and India to cease the attacks between both countries and revert to peace.
