Rafale deal: Kejriwal says CBI should raid Prime Minister’s Office

AAP’s Sanjay Singh files police complaint against Modi

Reacting to a report in The Hindu, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that the CBI should raid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office in connection with the Rafale aircraft deal.

The Hindu reported on Friday that Ministry of Defence (MoD) officials had raised concerns about the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) “bypassing” the MoD during negotiations for the Rafale deal in 2015.

Referring to the report, Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet: “In the light of today’s expose on Rafale, “independent” CBI should raid PMO, seize all the files related to Rafale and make arrests just like they raided my office and residence and Kolkata police commissioner [sic].”

Meanwhile, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh submitted a complaint at North Avenue police station as well as to the CBI Director against those “directly or indirectly involved in causing huge loss to the exchequer, including the Prime Minister of India”.

Citing The Hindu’s report, Mr. Singh demanded an investigation into the allegations and an FIR.

Mr. Singh, who was one of the petitioners in the Rafale matter in the Supreme Court, said the Centre had not told the apex court the truth in the matter.

“Investigation into the matter is most desirable and is the need of the hour as the persons who have been accused of causing loss to exchequer are the custodians of file and the files concerning the deal for purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets may also get destroyed in order to destroy the evidence against them [sic],” he wrote in his complaint.
