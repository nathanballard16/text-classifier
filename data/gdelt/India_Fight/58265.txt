Modi's Dream to Remove Identity of Kashmiris Will Not be Realised - Pakistani PM Imran Khan

The agenda based on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Hindutava ideology is aimed at not only removing the identity of the Kashmiri people but millions of people residing in India as well, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said during a talk with Kashmiri activist Tony Ashai in the capital Islamabad on Monday.

The nationalist volunteer organisation RSS is the parental organistion of India’s ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

India stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its seven decades old special status, provided under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, in August. Ever since then the union territories have been under a communications blockade.

Imran Khan said Modi’s dream will not be realised, adding that his government and the people of Pakistan will continue to support Kashmiris on all fronts including political, moral, and diplomatic.

Ashai, meanwhile, said that the international community will have to understand the agenda of the Modi government.
