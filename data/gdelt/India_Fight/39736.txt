Jaipur Pink Panthers won an intense battle against Gujarat Fortunegiants by a 22-19 scoreline at the EKA Arena by TransStadia in Ahmedabad yesterday to rise to the top of the Pro Kabaddi Season 7 standings.

Pankaj scored an impressive High 5 for Gujarat Fortunegiants but was unable to stop his team from slumping to their sixth loss on the trot.

In another match, a spectacular super raid by Rohit Baliyan on the buzzer ensured a 34-30 win for U Mumba against Patna Pirates. Patna Pirates forged a strong comeback in the second half, but U Mumba’s raiders did just enough to secure the win.
