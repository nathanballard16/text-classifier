‘Monkey’ baat divides Congress

MB Patil

S Shivashankarappa

It is ‘monkey’ baat which is troubling Congress in. It all started when veteran Congress leader and president of All-IndiaMahasabha Shamanur Shivashankarappa called Home Minister‘manga’ (monkey in Kannada).On Sunday, MB Patil hit back. Patil said thatwas losing his mental balance and hence indulging in cheap rhetoric. “I respected him as a father figure. But his words have exposed his character. He is the most selfish politician I have ever seen. He has not done anything for the society except for his family members,” he said.Furious with Shivashankarappa's comment that Patil had funded the Lingayat rallies through corrupt means, he added, “I was never part of the Lingayat rallies held at Bidar and Belagavi.Where is the proof that I funded these rallies? Shivashankarappa used to run a small business before he took control of the Bapuji group of institutions. We all know how he usurped it through illegal means.”Shivashankarappa dismissed the allegations and tried to clarify that he didn’t refer to Patil as ‘monkey’ and was instead misquoted.Efforts by senior Congress leaders to get the sniping duo to patch up have gone in vain.
