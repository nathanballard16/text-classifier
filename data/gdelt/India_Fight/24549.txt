Dia Mirza’s eco-friendly initiative on the sets of 'Kaafir'

After wrapping up the first schedule of her web series Kaafir in Himachal Pradesh, Dia Mirza has started shooting in Mumbai with her co-star Mohit Raina. An advocate of eco-friendly initiatives, the actress, we hear, presented the entire crew with metal water bottles customised with each of their names. On her part, Dia says, “It is very easy for each of us to make our lives single-use-plastic free, we just have to make the conscious choice to do so. Plastic bottles are the easiest to eliminate, so I hope this will be a start for the entire crew to be more aware.”
