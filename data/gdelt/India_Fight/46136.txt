Indian Army Porter Killed in Exchange of Fire Between India, Pakistan Troops

SRINAGAR - A porter working with Indian army was killed in an exchange of fire between troops of India and Pakistan on Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir, officials said Friday.

The skirmishes took place Thursday evening and the two sides targeted each other's positions with heavy fire and mortar shelling in Kamalkote-Uri sector of frontier Baramulla district, about 102 km west of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"One person identified as Abdul Qayoom, working as porter with Indian army was killed last evening after he was hit by small arms fire here," a police official said. "Though the porter was immediately removed to sub-district hospital in Uri but doctors there declared him brought dead."

According to police, exchange of fire was also witnessed in Nambla sector in the area.

Reports said skirmishes between the two sides also broke out Thursday in frontier district of Rajouri Poonch and Kautha in the region.

According to officials the shelling damaged some structures in the affected areas.

The exploding shells triggered fear among the residents and scared people took refuge at safer locations and inside bunkers.

Media reports said a woman was killed and three others wounded in Neza Pir sector on Pakistani side of LoC due to firing from Indian side.

For the past several days there has been a consistent increase in cease-fire violations along LoC and International Border.

New Delhi and Islamabad accuse each other of resorting to unprovoked firings and violating cease-fire agreements. And both sides maintain their troops gave befitting reply to the other side.
