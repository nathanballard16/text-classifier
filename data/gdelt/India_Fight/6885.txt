Indian Air Force Shows Aerial Power In Mega Pokhran Exercise; Tejas, Upgraded Mig 29, Akash, Astra Missiles In Action

In a firepower demonstration near the Pakistan border, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out a mega exercise in Pokhran which involved almost all variants of its fighter jets and attack helicopters.

This exercise comes two days post the Pulwama attacks in Jammu and Kashmir where 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in a suicide attack in Kashmir's Pulwama by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

In this ‘Vayu Shakti’ exercise, the Air Force flaunted the firepower capability of indigenously-developed platforms like Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, and efficacy of the Akash surface-to-air missile and Astra air-to-air missile, reported India Today.

Furthermore, the IAF also deployed the upgraded MiG-29 fighter jet in an air-to-ground role during this exercise, and the 137 aircraft included the Mirage 2000s, Mig-27, Su-30s, Mig-29, Bison, Mig-21, Hercules and AN-32 aircraft.
