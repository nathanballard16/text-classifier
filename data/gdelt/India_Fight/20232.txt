Deepika Padukone on being asked about motherhood: It will happen when it has to happen

There are some personal questions which Bollywood actors constantly face in their career. When they declare about being in a relationship, they are quizzed about their marriage plans and once they get married, they are bombarded with questions about embracing parenthood. Actors sometimes give a subtle reply and sometimes they take to their social media pages to slam those reports. During a recent interview with express.co.uk, Deepika Padukone was asked about pregnancy and motherhood.

To which the actor replied, "It will happen when it has to happen. Motherhood trumps being married. That’s what I hear from people who have had children. Of course, it will happen at some point but no, I think it is unfair to put women through that, to put a couple through that. I guess the day we stop asking the questions is when we will bring about change."

Well, we can't agree more!

Meanwhile, on the work front, Deepika is currently in Delhi where she is shooting for her upcoming film, Chhapaak, in which she is playing the role of an acid attack survivor named Malti. Her character is based on Laxmi Agarwal, who is an acid attack victim and a social activist now.

Chhapaak is being helmed by Meghna Gulzar and the film went on floors a few weeks back. The film also marks Deepika's debut as a film producer. Also starring Vikrant Massey as the male lead, Chhapaak is slated to release on January 10, 2020.
