CHENNAI: The Madras high court has passed an interim order directing that the death warrant issued by a sessions court to Manoharan, an accused in the Coimbatore siblings murder, be kept in abeyance until further orders.

The Supreme Court had in August upheld the death sentence for Manoharan for the 2010 rape of a 10-year-old girl and murder of the girl and her brother, 7, in Coimbatore. The mastermind of the kidnap and murder was killed in a police encounter.

The apex court, which held that the case fell under the rarest of rare categories, also dismissed the review petition on November 7. The accused moved the high court seeking to quash the death warrant issued by the Coimbatore sessions court.

A division bench of Justice M M Sundresh and Justice R M T Teeka Raman took note of the submissions by counsel for the accused that a mercy petition to the Governor was being prepared.
