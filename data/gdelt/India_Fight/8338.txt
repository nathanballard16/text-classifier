Tata Tea Chakra Gold takes Jaago Re (Meluku) campaign to Andhra Pradesh women

MUMBAI: For the first time, a Jaago Re (Meluku) campaign developed specifically for the women of Andhra Pradesh has been launched by Tata Tea’s premium brand in the region, Chakra Gold. The new TVC, created by MullenLowe Lintas, endeavours to awaken the strength of Andhra Pradesh's women towards self-empowerment while battling debilitating patriarchy and discriminatory societal norms.

Commenting on this campaign, TATA Global Beverages marketing head Puneet Das said, “TATA Tea Chakra Gold, known for its long lasting taste, is one of the most premium brands in the Tata Tea portfolio. For our latest campaign, we wanted to address the hopes and aspirations of the women in AP & Telangana. We had in-depth conversations with them where they expressed their deep desire to be free from oppressive societal ‘restrictions’ imposed on them. Hence, the aim was to bring alive these emotions of the women in this region.”

He added, “Our new TVC campaign shows TATA Tea Chakra Gold as a preferred choice for women who always leave a lasting mark on everything they do. This is in line with TATA Tea Jaago Re campaigns that have always been ahead of the curve when it comes to addressing deep rooted societal issues and ‘awakening’ consumers to such issues. In its first regional appearance in the southern part of India, the TVC aspires to make a strong statement in true Meluku style, and we hope it will resonate with our audience and inspire them towards self-empowerment.”

MullenLowe Lintas group CCO and chairman Amer Jaleel said, “Tata Tea Chakra Gold has always championed the South Indian woman in its advertising over the years. The shift is now to champion her strong views and actions, by which she awakens a societal and cultural change. That is why, for the first time, we have introduced the stirring emotions of Jaago Re to the Telugu-speaking audience.”
