Jodhpur: The legendary MiG-27 fighters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) retired on Friday after a final sortie at the Jodhpur Air Force station. The formidable ground-attack fighter of the IAF was given a water cannon salute as it bid adieu to the force it has been associated with through historic events such as the Kargil conflict and Operation Parakram.

The swing-wing aircraft has been the backbone of the IAF for the past four decades. The upgraded version has been serving the IAF since 2006. The other MiG variants such as MiG-23 BN and MiG-23 MF and the pure MiG 27 have already been decommissioned from the IAF.

"MiG27, the Swing wing fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force will have its winding down ceremony & final flight at Air Force Station Jodhpur Rajasthan tomorrow. It will be presided over by Air Marshal SK Ghotia, AOC-in-C SWAC," MoD spokesperson from Jaipur said in a tweet.

The fleet earned its glory during the 1999 Kargil conflict and successfully destroyed the enemy positions during the air operations. The fleet was also a part of Op Parakram and has been a regular participant at international wargames. The IAF's 29 squadron is the only unit to fly MiG-27s at the present moment.
