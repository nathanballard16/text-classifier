The cash quotient

The Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector literally forms the backbone of the Indian economy. Some 65 million MSMEs account for 120 million jobs. Two big policy moves by the Narendra Modi government have left the sector struggling. Demonetisation, which took out nearly 86 per cent of India's currency, dealt a liquidity blow to the MSMEs and hit their business. It was followed within months by the Goods & Services Tax (GST) that required MSMEs to rejig their structure and put them under immense compliance burden. Shake-ups in the banking and non-banking financial companies space starved MSMEs of capital even as they battled infrastructure issues. All of this has taken a heavy toll on a sector that is the second largest job creator in the country. What's added to their woes are tighter Non-Performing Asset (NPA) norms by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which classify an account with the slightest delay in repayment of interest as a 'special mention account', making it tougher for MSMEs to get access to credit. MSMEs have been demanding that the RBI give them the same loan restructuring options that big business has enjoyed. Prime Minister Modi has announced measures to help ease up flow of credit, including approval of loans up to Rs 1 crore online, but the liquidity crunch is much deeper. There has also been a massive spillover effect of companies that have gone for bankruptcy, disrupting the entire chain of supply companies.

The 100-day plan

WHY

The pain caused by demonetisation and GST persists and has come in addition to the hurdles MSMEs have been coping with in terms of ease-of-doing business

Several big businesses have filed for bankruptcy and that has debilitated the entire supply chain by hitting smaller companies that feed the big businesses

The financial sector is under heavy strain, which has dried up finance for MSMEs
