India violates UNSC resolutions, International Law: Qureshi tells Canadian counterpart

The minister shared that UNSC, at the request of Pakistan, had deliberations on the issue.

(Web Desk) – Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has apprised his Canadian Counterpart Ms Chrystia Freeland about the sufferings of people in occupied Kashmir under Modi-led Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) government.

Qureshi held a telephonic conversation with Freeland and briefed her about the unilateral and illegal moves of India, including suspension of mobile and internet services, imposition of curfew, human rights violations and blockade of the entire occupied Kashmir.

These actions, he said are in grave violation of international law and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and designed to change the demographic structure of the disputed territory.

The foreign minister expressed apprehension about the possibility of false flag operation by India and violations of the ceasefire agreement on the LoC which could further undermine peace and security of the region.

The minister shared that UNSC, at the request of Pakistan, had deliberations on the issue.

The Canadian foreign minister stated that Canada was following the situation closely. Referring to her earlier statement, she said Canada was concerned about the risk of escalation, infringements on civil rights and reports of detentions.
