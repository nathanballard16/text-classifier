Woman vs Bahubali: Unnao case must be a wakeup call

In a delayed but welcome mitigation, the Supreme Court has shifted trial in the Unnao rape and three related cases from Lucknow to Delhi. In 2012 the capital was racked by the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, which remains seared in its memory. But at least afterwards the law proceeded apace and the accused were sentenced in less than a year. What is much worse about the Unnao case is how the entire law and order machinery appears to have been systematically subverted for over two years, because of the political influence of the accused.

The survivor was a minor in June 2017 when she says she was raped by then BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his associates. It wasn’t until she tried to commit suicide outside UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s residence in April 2018 that Sengar was arrested. Around then, her father was also arrested after being brutally beaten; he died in custody. Subsequently CBI filed multiple chargesheets but not a single trial got initiated. In the latest blow, this Sunday a suspicious road accident killed two of her aunts, while seriously injuring the survivor as well as her lawyer.

This horror story underlines that the passage of stringent anti-rape laws is no substitute for an upright and independent police as well as efficient courts. Such a police can only be achieved via reforms that give it autonomy. This must be a priority, to end travesties of justice like Unnao.
