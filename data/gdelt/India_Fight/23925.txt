He was the only child of his parents.Darshan told the police that the conman - wearing a CRPF uniform with the name tag of MK Meenu and a star on its lapel -had posed as Kulwinder's colleague and visited their residence in Ropar district on Thursday. The conman spent three hours with them and promised to get a gas filling agency allocated to them on behalf of the CRPF. He showed them some documents, which he said were required to claim the gas agency from the Union government. The accused eventually managed to convince the couple to pay him Rs 20 lakh in lieu of the gas agency."The accused asked us to accompany him to an SBI branch where he told us to withdraw Rs 1.5 lakh," he said. Police haven't been able to identify the conman despite having CCTV footage in their possession. SSP Swapan Sharma said the district police is probing the case.
