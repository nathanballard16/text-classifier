What does it take in today's era to provide unbiased and ideology-free news, answers Sujit Nair of HW News

A- We do not have an ideology and yet the only ideology we follow is distributing news where information precedes opinion. If I were to support any particular ideology other than this, I would have started a political outfit instead of a news channel. This differentiates us and in this highly cluttered market, we have an engagement rate of 80% for our editorial videos on our English YouTube channel. This is new, refreshing, and possible due to our belief of how a news channel should be. We’re opinionated as well, but we never let it cloud our news. Here, we haven't used any rocket science but stuck to simple yet effective information backed opinions. What we have created here is something that does not impose any belief on the viewer but rather informs them and let them take their own decisions. With a collective effort, what we have created is what has helped us to outshine and stand out. Also I firmly believe that ideologies are meant for political parties. When news portals start promoting ideologies they change into political portals. The moment we get biased, we'll be digging our own graves.
