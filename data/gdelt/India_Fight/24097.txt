Local BJP leader killed as Kashmir goes to polls

Separatist militants in Kashmir shot dead a local leader of India’s ruling party as bloodshed continued to mar the general election campaign.

Gunmen opened fire on Gul Mohammad Mir, 65, an official of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), at his home in southern Kashmir on Saturday night. Local police denounced the shooting as a “terror crime”. Narendra Modi, the prime minister, wrote on Twitter yesterday that there was “no place for such violence in our country”.

Tensions are running high in Jammu and Kashmir. India’s only Muslim-majority state goes to the polls today in the fifth of seven phases in the general election. The BJP is deeply unpopular in much of the state, particularly in southern Kashmir where an insurgency against Indian rule is strongest.
