According to intelligence inputs received by defence forces, over 250 terrorists are waiting at terror launchpads in Pak occupied Kashmir near the LoC waiting to cross over to India to launch attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. These terrorists are waiting for opportune times to cross over into India with the backing of the Pakistani army. At some locations Pakistani army commandos are also present, meaning Pakistan could be trying to launch Border Action Teams to target Indian posts.
