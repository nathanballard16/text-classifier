Lucknow: At a time when police and youth are being attacked by cow vigilantes, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to impose a 'cow cess' on certain items under the excise department. The state cabinet on Tuesday cleared the proposal to levy a two per cent 'cow welfare cess' on the excise department, news agency IANS reported citing a government official.

The fund will be utilised for the welfare of cows and construction of cow shelters in the state. In the meeting that took place on Tuesday, a proposal was cleared for constructing cow sheds in districts, gram panchayats, municipalities, municipal corporations and other local bodies- IANS reported. The sheds will be constructed under the MNREGA and the government has sanctioned Rs 100 crore to the local bodies. To be called 'cow welfare cess', the tax will facilitate construction of shelters for about 1000 stray animals in every district.

The UP government's proposed cow cess comes on the backdrop of recent incidents involving attacks on police by cow vigilantes. At least three incidents have taken place over the past about a month, wherein Subodh Kumar, a police officer was killed by a mob which gathered to complain about police inaction against cow slaughter.

On Tuesday, police officials, who went to rescue cows locked inside a government school, were pelted upon with stones by local residents. The school teacher had complained that cow vigilantes had locked the cows inside the government school and the teachers were forced to conduct classes outside the school premises. While the oposition parties have targetted the government for its 'misplaced priorities', the move to construct cow shelters, many say, will be beneficial for farmers whose crops are destroyed by stray cattle.
