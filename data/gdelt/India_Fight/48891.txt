Kamlesh Tewari’s assassins travelled 1,500km, spent 120 hours in Uttar Pradesh

Duo sought cleric’s aid with maps to enter Nepal via Kheri

LUCKNOW: The two alleged killers of Hindu Samaj Party founder Kamlesh Tewari , who was shot and stabbed to death in broad day light in Lucknow recently, spent 120 hours in Uttar Pradesh — travelling 1,500km across six districts in six days.Their travel included rail, bus and thumbing a ride over taxi and private vehicle, said intelligence sources.This was before they were nabbed by Gujarat Police on Rajasthan border on Tuesday.Gujarat-based medical representative Moinuddin Pathan and food delivery boy Ashfaq had arrived by overnight by Udyog Karmi Express from Surat to Kanpur and took a taxi to Lucknow before eliminating Tewari on October 18.After allegedly eliminating Tewari at his Khursheedbagh residence in Lucknow, the duo took a combination of bus to reach Bareilly where Ashfaq received first aid from a cleric Syed Kaifi Ali at a shrine, clocking a 400-km distance on their nonstop trip.The two though failed to convince Ali for a night shelter but sought assistance with maps to enter Nepal via one of the bordering UP districts and finalised Lakhimpur Kheri as one of the weekend halt, said UP police sources.UP Police had deployed both STF and ATS to hunt the duo down but the two continued to give the cops a slip. Pathan and Ashfaq travelled 210 km again on a combination of bus and taxi until they reached Kheri. The two spent two nights in Palia town in Lakhimpur Kheri but also failed to cross the border. Sources in UP Police said poor network connectivity of large forest cover in Kheri was one of the reasons that hampered their hunt.Four days after the murder, the UP Police released the first clue of their sighting at a Saharanpur railway station as the two traversed another 130 km on a road trip till they entered Ambala in Haryana and then pushed off for Ajmer onward journey till Sabarkantha district in Gujarat. DGP OP Singh on Wednesday congratulated Gujarat Police for “excellent interagency coordination” while DCM Keshav Maurya expressed gratitude to Gujarat Police for their assistance.
