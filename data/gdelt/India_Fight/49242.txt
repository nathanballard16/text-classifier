Three Nepali workers murdered in India

BAITADI: Three Nepali migrant workers have been killed in Pithoragadh of India.

Although they were reportedly murdered on October 25, information about this was received here only on Sunday.

According to Dhan Bahadur Bohara, Deputy Chief of the Baitadi District Coordination Committee, the victims have been identified as Hare Bohara (36) and Beera Bohara (27) both of Dahatali in Purchaudi Municipality-5 and Kashi Bohara (36) of Bhatana Tadikhet of Purchaudi-4, both in Baitadi district.

According to Bohora, the authorities in Nepal have received the news of the trio being killed using sharped weapon.

Hare and Beera are brothers. They had been working as daily wage labourers at Silaulmad in Pithoragadh of India for one-and-half years.

Deputy chief Bohara said that authorities suspect Kirra Bohara — wife of murdered Hare Bohara — involvement in the murders as she is absconding.

The bodies of the victims have been kept at the Pithoragadh District Hospital.

Beera had gone to meet his elder brother and sister-in-law in Pithoragadh some months back and had stayed there to work.

It is not yet known who killed the three workers.
