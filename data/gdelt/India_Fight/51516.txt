A 17-YEAR-OLD boy set himself ablaze at his school on Friday after his father, a police constable, allegedly refused to allow him to take his bike to school. A student of Class XI at school in Kalamboli, he has suffered 90 per cent burns.

An officer from Kalamboli police said that in the morning, the teenager had a fight with his father after the latter did not allow him to take his bike to school, as he did not have a driving license.

“Following this, the boy took an empty bottle from his house and filled it with petrol from his father’s bike. He then went to the school bathroom on the second floor and set himself on fire,” the officer added.

The boy was initially rushed to the MGM hospital. Later, he was shifted to the Airoli Burns Centre. “When the doctors asked him why he did such a thing, he said that he was upset as his father had not allowed him to take his bike to school,” said the officer.
