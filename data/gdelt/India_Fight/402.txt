Mumbai: A 21-year-old man has been arrested by city police for allegedly slitting the throat of his friend, a 25-year-old man after the victim refused to give him money to buy drugs. Officials with the Pantnagar police said that the shocking incident took place in Ghatkopar on Tuesday.

Identified as Pantnagar resident Suresh Pande, the accused allegedly attacked the victim after the latter refused to give him Rs 150 which he wanted to buy drugs at around 9.30 pm on Tuesday. Both Pande and the victim, one Sandip Ghadge, are residents of Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar East.

Police officials familiar with the matter said that when the victim refused to lend him the money, Pande began abusing and assaulting him. Pande then took out a knife he was carrying and attacked Ghadge in a fit of rage. The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital where he is currently being treated for injuries incurred during the attack.

Following the incident, police registered a case of 'attempt to murder' against Pande and traced him to Ghatkopar West from where he was arrested. A similar incident was reported from the same area where a man named Irfan Khan was attacked outside the Pantnagar police station on Wednesday over a petty dispute. Reports suggest that this attack also occurred over monetary disputes between the victim and the accused, one Kalpesh Sawant.
