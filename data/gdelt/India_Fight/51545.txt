MOH Still Struggling with Procurement of Anti-retroviral Medication

Nov 15, 2019

The procurement of anti-retroviral medication for persons living with HIV/AIDS continues to be an issue for the Ministry of Health. For months the Ministry has been battling with a shortage of the medication and persons affected have been at risk. Despite receiving a shipment of drugs from Costa Rica, the ministry is still trying to find an alternative supplier, since purchasing the badly needed meds from India is proving to be difficult. The Minister of Health, Pablo Marin, says that government is doing all within its means to source and acquire the medication from another market.

“We are trying our best, if you know; I did sign for Costa Rica to lend us some of their products which we did get. We have to give them back but right now the production of it is limited. We are trying all sources, we have gone with PAHO, we have gone to the Mexican side to see if we can get it. We are trying our best because we know it’s something that we need and we have tried our best and like we mentioned before, the anti-retroviral that we have is for everybody and it’s free and we try for our people to live longer. So we are working on that. My DHS [Director of Health Services] is doing everything possible and if we need to sign another or loan for the anti-retroviral then we will do that.”

“Is it a possibility that perhaps these medications can be sourced from another market, as opposed to solely from India?”

“Remember, what we buy is through PAHO because PAHO has the contacts and they do all the diligence in providing us the right medication. But yes, we are still looking around for where we can buy it.”
