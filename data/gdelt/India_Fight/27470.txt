As per the tweet by a user, Md Asif Khan, whose profile suggests he works as Assistant Director in the TV and film industry, a man asked the Muslim hawker his name. “When the hawker responded ‘Mohd Qasim’, the perpetrator asked him: ‘What he was doing here, you should be in Pakistan and fired at him’,” read the tweet. Md Asif Khan, the self-avowed socialist, also attached a video with his post, stating: “This is Modi's Hindu Rashtra 2.0”.

In the video, Mohd Qasim can be seen telling the person, who probably made the video, that he was shot by someone called Rajeev.

Albeit the veracity of the video is not yet ascertained, Owaisi chose to make a comment on the tweet.

“Qasim almost lost his life for literally just saying his name. But sure, I am ‘fear mongering’ Where does Rajiv’s brazenness come from? From the top. BJP’s leadership has constantly demonised us & associated us with Pakistan We’re not human in their eyes, we’re target practice,” tweeted Owaisi.
