I-T raids based only on info; no bias: Government

NEW DELHI: The policy on income tax raids is to act on information as it is received as this ensures neutrality while the decision on when the Election Commission is to be formally informed depends on whether cash seized can be related to elections, the government is understood to have conveyed to the poll watchdog.In its interaction with the EC, the revenue department is understood to have responded to concerns over “neutrality” of the I-T department’s actions by pointing out that there was no balancing of operations in terms of political parties and that they were determined by the intelligence received.Sources said the I-T department was not the only agency tracking unaccounted cash. This task was being carried out by state police and the EC itself and they could act on instances of wrongdoing that came to light. The revenue department itself was not informed of raids being planned as this was not required.The raids on associates of Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath have resulted in documents indicating money being gathered under the heads of various state government departments, said sources.A high level of secrecy is maintained before any I-T search and survey operation is initiated. For instance, a raiding party may include any of 2,000 officers of the department for a search operation to be carried out in more than 12 cities and none of them may know the target even 10 minutes before the action begins.If a raiding party has to travel, say 50 km to reach its target, the group of officers can only open a sealed envelope, containing the warrant of search with mention of the target after reaching close to the destination which is orally conveyed to them before handing over the envelope the same morning.Each major state and city has a directorate general of I-T investigation headed by a director general officer. The second-in-command, the principal director, is authorised to issue a warrant for search with the administrative approval of the DG. The additional director of I-T investigation, who heads one of the units in the directorate general of investigation of a particular city, is responsible for developing a case based on intelligence inputs received from different sources.So, in practice, only two highest ranking officers of I-T investigation are actually aware of any I-T searches, besides the ADI who develops the case, before a search begins.In recent searches in Madhya Pradesh involving Nath’s aides, the intelligence was received by the Delhi unit of I-T investigation of large cash transfers by some politicians and their associates.To keep the search operation completely secret, the Delhi unit flew its team to Bhopal and Indore to carry out searches, not even engaging the local investigation unit. The extraordinary measures were taken because just last month, Karnataka CM H D Kumaraswamy had disclosed an impending raid on his close associates, a day before it actually happened.
