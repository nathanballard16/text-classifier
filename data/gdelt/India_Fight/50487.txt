Priyanka Chopra Jonas relishes on ‘daulat ki chaat’ in Delhi as Rajkummar Rao captures her; See Pics

Whenever Bollywood stars shoot in different cities in the country, they get a chance to explore the local food and dishes. Speaking of this, Priyanka Chopra Jonas is currently in New Delhi where she is shooting for a project with Rajkummar Rao. While Priyanka had tweeted against the air pollution in the city, she is also making sure she has the time of her life as she works in the city. Today, an example of it was seen as Priyanka shared some photos of her unique dessert on social media.

Priyanka took to Instagram to share a photo in which she can be seen getting amused by a dessert she is all set to relish. In the photo, we can see the famous Delhi dessert, ‘daulat ki chaat’ but with a twist. The twist in the dessert is what left Priyanka amused. In the photos of the dessert, we can see currency notes on the sides. Daulat in english means wealth and hence, the restaurant literally also served up a dessert to Priyanka that had money in it. Seeing it, Priyanka couldn’t resist and shared the unique sweet with her fans.

Rajkummar Rao also clicked the photos of the dessert and Priyanka’s amused expression on seeing the same. PeeCee captioned the photo as, “Cash in my dessert. Now that’s a first #daulatkichaat #onlyinindia #delhistories #setlife @RajkummarRao.”

The Sky Is Pink was directed by Shonali Bose.
