New Delhi, February 15

Congress president Rahul Gandhi today said the Opposition stands with the government and the security forces in whatever decision they take to counter terrorism.

Addressing reporters a day after the dastardly attack on a CRPF convoy in Kashmir, Gandhi said the terrorists have attacked the soul of India and the Congress stands with the government.

“The entire Opposition stands with the security forces and the government. This kind of violence against our most valuable people our soldiers is disgusting,” he said flanked by former PM Manmohan Singh, and former ministers AK Antony and Ghulam Nabi Azad. Gandhi said nothing, no amount of terror, hatred and anger could undermine the love on which this country has been built.

Singh also said: “Today is a day of mourning. Our country has lost 40 jawans and our foremost duty is to convey to the grieving families that we stand with them in condemning this act of terror. We will not compromise with acts of terror and we will stand together in whatever needs to be done to counter terrorism.”

Gandhi said the Congress wouldn’t have any conversations as yet apart from the fact that it stands united with the soldiers and the government. His press conference today marked a departure from the party’s official spokesperson’s line on the Pulwama attack last evening. Congress media head Randeep Surjewala yesterday attacked the BJP for its poor security record, attacked the PM for terrorist attacks since he assumed power. He was not present in the morning’s press conference.
