Congress to stage nation-wide protest today

Congress will stage a protest against a leader of Hindu Mahasabha, who had recreated Gandhi’s assassination by shooting at Gandhi’s effigy recently, on Monday in Bengaluru, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President Dinesh Gundu Rao said.

“The protest will be held across the country.”

He was speaking to mediapersons here, on Sunday.

“In the name of protecting the religion, there is an increase in violence in the country. BJP is supporting communal forces in the country. The Centre should initiate strict action against Hindu Mahasabha,” he said.

Dinesh said that the seat sharing discussion between Congress and JD(S) had not yet commenced. The Congress High Command and JD(S) Supremo will take a final call on the seats to be shared between the two parties.

“All we want is candidates from the Congress and JD(S) win maximum seats to defeat communal BJP.”

He, further, said that there is good coordination between chief minister and Congress leaders. “Minor differences of opinion may be present in the grassroot-level workers. All the 80 Congress MLAs will take part in the Budget session in Karnataka.”

On BJP’s Operation Kamala, he said, “Where does the BJP get money to offer to our MLAs? How many crores have they spent to lodge the BJP MLAs from Karnataka in a seven star resort?” He accused MP Nalin Kumar Kateel of involving in horse-trading and corrupt activities.

To a query on MLA J N Ganesh, he said that Ganesh was absconding. Deputy Chief Minister Dr G Parameshwar is heading a special committee to probe the incident involving two legislators —Ganesh and Anand Singh.”

AICC General Secretary and in charge of Karnataka K C Venugopal and others were present.
