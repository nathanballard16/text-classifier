NEW DELHI, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least five members of a family were killed and one girl injured critically Sunday after a trawler truck crushed a car in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, police said.

The accident took place at Mandwada in Barwani district, about 322 km southwest of Bhopal, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh.

"In a tragic road accident today a fast-moving trawler truck collided head-on with a car carrying members of a family, killing five people on the spot and injuring one girl," a police official said. "The trawler truck totally crushed the car under it."

The injured girl was immediately removed to a hospital, where she has been admitted inside the intensive care unit.

Reports said the family was heading to attend a marriage ceremony.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the trawler truck was being rashly driven.

Deadly road accidents are common in India often caused by overloading, bad condition of roads and reckless driving.
