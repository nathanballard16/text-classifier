Over four years ago, Rani Mukerji gave a fiesty performance as the policewoman Shivani Shivaji Roy, who takes on the kingpin of a child-trafficking racket in Mardaani. Now, the actress is all set for an encore as she dons the khaki once again for the sequel, Mardaani 2. This time around, Shivani is the Superintendent of Police locked in a vicious battle with a 21-year-old merciless villain.

While the anticipation is high for the movie, the news of which was broken by After Hrs, we have heard that Rani begins shooting this film on March 18.

Interestingly, this movie comes as a stark contrast to her last outing, Hichki (2018), in which she essayed a teacher with Tourette syndrome.

The new drama thriller, which also marks the directorial debut of Gopi Puthran, will go on floors with a short spell in Mumbai. “Rani is raring to go and it will be thrilling to see her back in action as Shivani Shivaji Roy. What adds to the curiosity is that this time, the villain is a 21-year old who knows no empathy. Their edge-of-the-seat showdown will have the audiences glued to their seats,” reveals a source associated with the movie.
