Bootlegged liquor kills more than 100 in India

NEW DELHI – More than 100 people have died in northeastern India after drinking bootleg liquor, the second mass poisoning from illegal alcohol to hit the country this month.

The deaths occurred in the state of Assam when workers on tea plantations consumed tainted liquor sold by unlicensed vendors, officials said. Dozens are still being treated in local hospitals.

Bootleg liquor is cheap, powerful and widely available in India, making it a popular option for those who cannot afford the alcohol sold at state-licensed outlets.

In Assam, the poisonings began on Thursday afternoon. Four women – workers at a nearby tea plantation – were admitted to a hospital in Golaghat district in serious condition after drinking bootleg liquor, said Pushpraj Singh, the local superintendent of police. He said that police were working to trace the origin of the tainted liquor.

At least 59 people died in Golaghat district, according to Dhiren Hazarika, a local administrator, and 43 more people died in the neighboring district of Jorhat, suggesting that the illegal alcohol came from a nearby source.

People who drank the deadly liquor arrived at hospitals complaining of abdominal pain, blurry vision and severe headaches, said Ratan Bordoloi, a local health department official. In the wake of the tragedy, state authorities arrested suspected bootleggers, raided distilleries and suspended local bureaucrats.
