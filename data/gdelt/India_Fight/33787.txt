Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been showering love on each other via social media pages.

Moreover, they even celebrated Ranveer's birthday which was held on July 6. DP also wished him in the most adorable way and fans couldn't stop gushing over them.

A while back, Deepika took to her Instagram page and shared a photo of holding Ranveer's hand in an intertwined way. She wrote a beautiful note which gave a glimpse of their amazing relationship. The actor captioned her post stating, "There’s something so real about holding hands, some kind of complex simplicity, saying so much by doing so little...X".

Earlier, while talking to Bombay Times, Deepika spoke about working with Ranveer post-marriage by saying, "When you are in the business of movies, you are playing a character. Of course, all of this is yet to play out, but at the end of the day, you are essaying a role, and at that point, you are not thinking whether your co-actor is your husband, brother or someone you know closely. All you try to do is, be honest in that moment. The personal equation doesn’t spill over into the workspace. I can’t think of anyone else who could do justice to the role (of Kapil Dev), but if there was someone else playing him in the film, and not Ranveer, I would still do my part. This isn’t coming from a personal equation, but from my passion and enthusiasm for the film."
