MUMBAI: Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan who was undergoing medical treatment for neuroendocrine tumour in London has now returned to India.

The critically-acclaimed actor flew to London in March last year and revealed that he’s suffering from tumour. Ever since then, the actor has been away from the limelight. Irrfan’s arrival in the country was already speculated and some even claim that the actor will soon begin shooting for the sequel of Hindi Medium.

A source close to the actor confirmed the 51-year-old star is back in India. The source said, “Irrfan is back in Mumbai. But people are publishing all sorts of stories without any confirmation. They are not true. I will get an update on his health and when will he be resuming work when I meet the actor soon,”

The source further revealed that the global start will star in Hindi Medium 2 but not sure when the shooting will start. On the work front, other than Hindi Medium sequel, Irrfan will also be seen in a biopic on Udham Singh, which will be directed by Shoojit Sircar.
