Nirbhaya case: DCW chief urges President to reject mercy plea of one of convicts

Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal on Thursday urged President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy petition filed by one of the convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya murder case.

Maliwal's hunger strike to demand capital punishment for rapists within six months of their conviction entered the third day on Thursday.

Vinay Sharma, one of the convicts facing the gallows in the 2012 gangrape and murder case of a 23-year-old paramedic student, had filed a mercy petition before the president.
