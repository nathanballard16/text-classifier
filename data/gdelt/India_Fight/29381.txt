In a surprise move, the Jammu and Kashmir government on Saturday removed J&K Bank Chairman Parvez Ahmed. The Anti-Corruption Bureau carried out a raid at the lender’s corporate office in connection with alleged fraudulent appointments.

The government appointed the bank’s executive president R K Chibber, as an interim chairman of the lender, and defended the decision to sack Ahmed, saying it was part of long term measures for improving functioning of the bank in accordance with the RBI guidelines.

“As a first step, the Government has decided to change its nominee Director on the Board of J&K Bank, Parvez Ahmed, who is also the Chairman and Managing Director. Consequent to his replacement as a government appointed Director, the Board has taken on record cessation of Directorship of Parvez Ahmed as Chairman and Managing Director,” the spokesman had said.

Within minutes of the government order, sleuths of Anti-Corruption Bureau -- previously known as State Vigilance Organisation -- raided the corporate headquarters of the bank situated at M A Road in Srinagar.

Jammu & Kashmir government holds 59 per cent stake in J&K Bank.
