Sources said Pakistan Air Force (PAF) commanders were still worried about possible attacks more than two months after an Indian Air Force (IAF) counter-terror strike on Pakistan’s Balakot region. The sources told India’s Economic Times newspaper the PAF F-16s had been flown from their home bases in Punjab province an redeployed across satellite airbases to avoid major losses in possible strikes from India.

India vs Pakistan: Why do India and Pakistan clash?

They said the PAF “has been at forward locations all along the Line of Control and the International Border after the Balakot strikes and its failure to counter India”.

The Pakistan Army has also maintained a heavy deployment of tanks and armoured regiments along Sialkot region close to Jammu region and Indian forces are keeping a close watch on their activities there.

India has also made precautionary deployments against these armoured formations on its side of the borders including its own advanced armoured forces.

The latest move comes amid simmering tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi which boiled over on February 14 when at least 40 Indian security personnel were killed in a terrorist attack in Pulwama, India.
