Man gets life term for murder

Nimapara: A local court here Tuesday sentenced a 45-year-old man to life imprisonment on charges of murder.

Additional district and sessions judge Chintamani Panda Monday convicted Jagabandhu Behera, a resident of Nagpur village under Balakati outpost limits in Khurda district, after holding him guilty under Sections 302 (Punishment for murder) and 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

According to sources, Behera had abducted the daughter of Surendra Rout of the village May 2, 2010. And after an unsuccessful search, Rout approached Balakati outpost. Accordingly, police registered a missing case (3/10).

“Behera had taken Rout’s daughter to Surat (Gujarat). Later on, he beheaded the woman and dumped her torso near Konark beach June 26, 2010,” a source said quoting the case diary.

On information, Konark police recovered the torso and sent it for post-mortem before registering a case (29/11) in this regard. Later, Behera was taken into custody.

The court awarded the jail term after analysing the cases registered with Konark police, Balakati police outpost and the ST case (9/255/2016) registered with the court, prosecution lawyer Brahmananda Pradhan said.
