India, Saudi Arabia agree on need to turn up heat on terror supporters: PM Modi

India and Saudi Arabia agreed on the need to increase "all possible pressure" on countries offering support for terrorism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday in a joint statement with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

An enraged India is mourning the loss of more than 40 Army and CRPF soldiers martyred in a terrorist attack and a subsequent encounter in Kashmir in the past week.

Dozens of CRPF personnel were killed in a suicide attack carried out in Pulwama district on February 14 by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Later, four Army soldiers and a policeman were martyred in an encounter in which the mastermind of last week's attack and two other terrorists were also killed.

Pakistan has denied responsibility for the bombing in Pulwama and threatened retaliation in the event of an attack by India, which has vowed to exact revenge.

On Wednesday, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by his side, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed to the attack in Pulwama to lay stress on the danger posed by terrorism.

Mohammed bin Salman, on his part, said extremism and terrorism were common concerns for India and Saudi Arabia.

He offered Saudi Arabia's cooperation on all fronts, and said his country would work with everyone to ensure a brighter future for upcoming generations.

Mohammed bin Salman's visit to India follows a trip to Pakistan, where Saudi investment agreements worth $20 billion were announced.

The Congress took aim at the Modi government on Wednesday, pointing to these investments and the warm welcome accorded to Crown Prince Salman in India. It asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi if breaking protocol to personally welcome the Saudi leader was his way of remembering the Pulwama martyrs.
