A gleaming Kangana Ranaut meets PM Narendra Modi in Delhi; View Pics

At an event in Delhi, a gleaming Kangana Ranaut met our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There are not many things different in these two flaming nationalists as when it comes to talking about their personalities, both are firebrands in their respective jobs. From nepotism to gender pay disparity, Kangana has never shied away from calling a spade a spade, even if that meant a controversy. On the other hand, we need not mention about Modiji after his fearless attitude and drive after the Pulwama attacks in Kashmir. Under his brave guidance, our air force pilots destroyed terrorists camps in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and also managed to bring home the Braveheart Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captivated by the Pakistani forces across the border.



At the same event, Kangana was asked if she ever feels left out when she's not included in the ‘Best Actress lists put out by Bollywood, to which she said, I don't feel left out. I feel I stand out. When you talk about actresses, here's a three-time National Award-winning actress. The Mr Johar's of the world try to present a list of people whose acting abilities are questionable and with a blank face. It's brain-feeding of another magnitude."





After the release of her last film Manikarnika, bold and brazen Kangana Ranaut also voiced her opinion against the whole of Bollywood when they chose to stand aloof from Kangana’s film and not many came out in support of it. She said, “How will it benefit me? I’ve already won 3-4 national awards. At the age of 31, I am a filmmaker. Khud ko he promote kar le bohot badi baat hai (it would be a big deal if they can promote themselves). Is Rani of Jhansi my aunt? She’s as much mine as she’s yours. Then why are these people scared? They are worried just because I spoke on nepotism? They have formed a gang, ‘Why did she speak on nepotism?”
