KABUL: Terrorism is a cancer in the region and its elimination requires collective efforts, President Ashraf Ghani said this in reaction to a deadly terrorist attack in India that killed 37, wounding five others.

President Ghani strongly condemned the terrorist attack that targeted CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir.

“The government of Afghanistan expresses its sympathy and deep condolences to the Indian government and people, and the families of the soldiers who fell victim to the incident,” President Ghani said.

He furthered, “Terrorism is a cancer in the region, and it requires collective efforts to root it out.”

Thursday’s attack on a convoy of Indian soldiers killed 37 and wounded five, government spokesperson Bharat Bhushan said Friday. It was deadliest attack on security forces since the beginning of the insurgency in the late 1980s.

The Indian government has blamed Pakistan-based terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammed for the attack.

“We demand that Pakistan stop supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries,” India’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

On Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a warning to terrorist groups, saying that the “the blood of the people is boiling.”

“I want to tell the terrorist organizations and their supporters that have made a huge mistake. They will have to pay a very heavy cost for this. I give assurance to the nation that the forces behind the attack, the culprits behind this attack — they will definitely be punished for their actions,” he said at an event in New Delhi.
