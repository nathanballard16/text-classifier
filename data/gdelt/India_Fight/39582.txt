The IMD forecast said that heavy rainfall is likely over the districts of North Bengal on Friday and Saturday.

"Due to passing of Monsoon Trough at mean sea level through Sriniketan and thence east-northeastwards to Nagaland across Bangladesh & south Assam and strong incursion of moisture heavy rainfall is likely over the districts of North Bengal during next 48 hours(16 & 17th August 2019)," it said.
