New Delhi, Oct 31: With heavy rains lashing parts of Kerala due to the presence of cyclonic storm Maha over Arabian Sea, a holiday has been declared for educational institutions including professional colleges in Kochi and Paravur taluks in Ernakulam district, Kodungallur and Chavakad taluks of Thrissur district will remain closed on Thursday.

A deep depression in the Arabian Sea intensified into a 'very severe cyclonic storm' on Wednesday. Called 'Maha' (pronounced as M'maha), it is likely to weaken into a 'cyclonic storm' in the next 12 hours.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm would move over Lakshadweep Islands before emerging into the eastcentral Arabian Sea. Lakshadweep will receive extremely heavy rainfall today.

Over the next two days, Lakshadweep and parts of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are likely to receive rains due to a cyclone in the Arabia Sea. Cyclone Maha, which is likely to pass Lakshadweep today, is moving towards eastcentral Arabian Sea.
