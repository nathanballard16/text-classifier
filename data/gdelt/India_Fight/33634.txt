Tribals from Navamalai demand concrete houses to escape from wild elephants

Coimbatore: Residents of a tribal hamlet at Navamalai near Pollachi petitioned collector K Rajamani on Monday, requesting him to provide concrete houses to protect themselves from wild elephants.

Two people, including a minor girl, were killed by wild elephants two months ago, the residents said.

Over 50 families are residing in Navamalai tribal settlement, which is located inside the reserve forest. Most of the residents were working as farm labourers and staying in huts on agricultural fields belonging to private parties.

On May 24, 2019, seven-year-old Ranjani, a class II student, who was returning to her home along with her mother, was killed by a lone tusker. The girl’s mother Chitra managed to escape.

The next day, farm worker Mahali, 65, was trampled to death by a wild elephant.

Following the deaths, the forest department brought two kumki elephants to the area. But they were later sent back.

Now, wild elephants are again frequenting the area, Chitra told reporters. “The menace has increased. The elephants raid agricultural fields and damage the huts. Sometimes, they eat rice kept in our houses and damage coconut trees. We are living in a state of fear in Navamalai.”

Chitra requested authorities to provide patta land for the tribals staying in huts. “We want land in Navamalai and concrete houses to safeguard us.”
