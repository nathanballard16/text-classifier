Salman & Alia will be seen shooting on the streets of Orlando and the beaches of Miami. Considering the massive fan base that both the actors have, SLB wants to ensure that both the actors are safe and have planned for Hollywood level security for them.

“Alia and Salman are huge stars. They are recognisable around the world and Miami has a huge Indian diaspora as well. So it is important to have a proper security arrangement for them to shoot in Miami. Even when Hollywood films are shot here in Miami, there is huge security. Bhansali’s team wanted the security to match with Hollywood standards,” informs a source close to the development of the film.
