Around 8-10 fire tenders along with hydrolic platforms were pressed into service to douse the fire. No casualties or injuries were reported.

“The CM has formed a three-member team for an inquiry. The committee comprises ADG (Intelligence), Joint Managing Director of the UPSIDC and Lucknow Chief Fire Officer (CFO). The committee will investigate all aspects of the incident, determine the cause of the fire and also fix responsibility for the incident. The report has to be submitted within 48 hours,” said Awanish Awasthi, Additional Chief Secretary, information.

Lucknow CFO Vijay Kumar Singh said the department was informed about the fire around 7:45 am and fire tenders soon reached the spot. The fire was doused after over two-and-a-half hours.
