IAF hits JeM’s biggest training camp: Here’s what Raja Singh says

New Delhi/Hyderabad: Twelve days after the Pulwama attack, the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Tuesday carried out strikes at terror camps at multiple places in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, destroying control rooms of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and some other infrastructure.

The terror camps in Chakothi and Muzaffarabad, both in PoK and in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa region were struck by 12 Mirage 2000 jets with 1000 kgs of explosives at around 3:30 am, IAF sources said.

The sources said Pakistan scrambled F-16 fighters to retaliate but turned back owing to the size of the Indian formation.

This is the first time that India has taken a pro-active action using the air force across the LoC as even during the three-month-long Kargil conflict of 1999, the IAF planes did not cross the LoC even while hitting the positions occupied by Pakistani forces on the Indian side.

Expressing his view on strikes at terror camps, BJP MLA Raja Singh said that Indian Air Force took the revenge of Pulwama Attack. He said that by dropping a 1000 kg bomb in Pakistan, India created history. “200-300 terrorists killed in the strikes”, he added.
