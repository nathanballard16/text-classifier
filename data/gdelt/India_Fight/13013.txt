Sara Ali Khan's birthday wish for Janhvi Kapoor will make you wish for their on-screen collaboration

Sara Ali Khan wishes Janhvi Kapoor on her birthday

Ever since the first teaser of Sara Ali Khan's debut film Kedarnath dropped last year, people started pitting her against Janhvi Kapoor. It started the ball rolling for multiple social media posts and articles about who is better - Sara or Janhvi? While the two have always maintained that they are in cordial terms with each other and there is no animosity or competition between them, the comparisons refuse to die down.

And now, today as Janhvi Kapoor turns 22, Sara Ali Khan was one of the first persons to send across her birthday wishes to her "contemporary". She took to her Instagram account and uploaded a picture of her Janhvi on the Instagram stories and wrote, "Happiest birthday @janhvikapoor Have an amazing day and a wonderful year ahead."

Meanwhile, the birthday girl is currently in Lucknow shooting for her next film based on the life of Gunjan Saxena, one of the first women combat aviators, who fought the Kargil war in 1999. Janhvi revealed that she visited Kashi and attended Ganga aarti ahead of her birthday. Speaking about it, she told Mumbai Mirror, "We drove to Varanasi after the day’s work so I could see the Ganga aarti and go to the Kashi Vishwanath temple. I wanted to visit Tirupati (in Andhra Pradesh) again, mom (Sridevi) used to climb up to the temple every year for her birthday when she was working. I went there earlier this year and wanted to go again on my birthday, but arrangements couldn’t be made on time. I might go next week."

Further talking about her birthday plans, Janhvi stated, "There’s no better place for me in the world than a film set. My only wish is that I get the chance to do good work and make my parents (Boney Kapoor and Sridevi) proud."
