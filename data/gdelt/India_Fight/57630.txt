AMU: Two ‘Fact-Finding’ Reports By Activists Had Blamed Police For Breaking Open University Gate; CCTV Footage Contradicts

On the evening of 24 December, the official handle of the Uttar Pradesh police put out a video accompanied by the text – “A reaffirmation of our earlier stand that the AMU gate was not broken down by any security agency”.

The post tagged several news publications including The Times of India and Hindustan Times.

The 10-minute video shows CCTV footage of students breaking the Bab-e-Syed gate at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and pelting the police force with stones on 15 December. The time recorded in the footage is around 8.30 pm.
