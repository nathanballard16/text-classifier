1 of 3 detained soldiers shot my son: Aurangzeb's father

SRINAGAR: Mohammad Hanief Salani, father of slain rifleman Aurangzeb , on Thursday claimed that his son was killed by one of the three detained Kashmiri soldiers, while he was held captive by six Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists.Three Kashmiri soldiers have been detained by the Army for planning Aurangzeb’s abduction in close contact with Hizb terrorists, when he was on way to his home in Salani hamlet of Mendhar in Poonch district for Eid celebrations last year on June 14.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Salani, a former Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAKLI) army man said that his claim was based on information divulged to him by Army sources.Salani joined BJP in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week at a rally in Jammu.Talking to TOI, Salani alleged that one of the three detained soldiers was the main culprit in the murder of his son. “All three arrested soldiers of 4-JAKLI were in touch with Hizb terrorists and were passing information to them,” he claimed.One of the three riflemen had gone on leave nearly a week earlier on the pretext of Eid celebrations, after Aurangzeb decided to come home for Eid, Salani said. “The soldier had even invited Aurangzeb to his home for tea when he was traveling in a private vehicle to the bus stand for home on the fateful day,” he added.“Two of the three arrested soldiers, who were at the RR camp on duty, informed their colleague about the movement and the vehicle number of Aurangzeb. The soldier was tracking down Aurangzeb by calling him through a different mobile phone. He had switched off his personal mobile,” Salani claimed.The soldier, according to Salani, was part of the Hizb cell and wore a mask when they dragged out Aurangzeb from the vehicle near Kalampora area in Pulwama district on June 14 morning. “The mobile of my son and his other belongings were snatched by his colleague. He opened fire on my son in the presence of terrorists,” he alleged.The bullet-riddled body of Aurangzeb was found at Gussu village, about 10 km from Kalampora, in Pulwama district, from where he was abducted. Aurangzeb, a decorated soldier, was part of the Army team that had gunned down the wanted Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Sameer Tiger.
