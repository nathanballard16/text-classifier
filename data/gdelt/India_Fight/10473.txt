Better sense should prevail says Imran Khan on escalated dispute

Two Indian MIGs crossed the LoC and they were shot down, said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in live TV address. He also added that if the situation escalates, it will no longer be in my control or in Narendra Modi's.

Khan also called for talks with India and hoped "better sense" would prevail to de-escalate the dispute with its nuclear-armed neighbour following air strikes by both sides. "We should sit down and talk," he said in a brief televised broadcast.

A Pakistani Air Force F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Indian air defence forces in Rajouri sector of Jammu region on Wednesday morning, officials said. The aircraft was brought down in Jhangar area of Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri sector, officials in the Army said.

Airport services to resume for now

In the meantime, aviation watchdog DGCA Wednesday said operations at the nine airports, which were shut earlier in the day, have resumed "as of now".

Earlier on Wednesday, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM), saying flight operations at the airports in Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Pathankot, Amritsar, Shimla, Kangra, Kullu Manali and Pithoragarh will remain shut from February 27 to May 27.

The move to suspend operations the airports had come amid escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan after the IAF carried out strikes on terror bases in Pakistan.
