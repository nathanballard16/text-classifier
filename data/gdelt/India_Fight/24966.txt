Gill questions rivals’ ‘silence’

Ludhiana: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Ludhiana candidate Tejpal Singh on Saturday launched an attack on the Congress, SAD-BJP and PDA candidates claiming that all three have been silent over the issue of “blatant loot of public space and misuse of public money”.

AAP candidate Tejpal Gill and spokesperson Ahbaab Singh Grewal while addressing a press conference here on Saturday, alleged that a prime piece of land in Sarabha Nagar worth several crores has been ‘illegally’ appropriated to construct three different private schools.

Gill alleged that these construction and sub-leases have been done by someone in an illegal manner, who had close proximity with a stat minister. Gill questioned as to why no other candidates were raising this issue. Regarding Smart City project, Gill said that the public money was misused and wasted and none of the candidates were concerned about development in the city.
