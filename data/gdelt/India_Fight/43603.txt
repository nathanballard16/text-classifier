Hyderabad St. Francis College Strict Dress Code Irks Students

Hyderabad: Student of St. Francis College for Women at Begumpet have planned a protest on Monday against the college dress code rule which was introduced last month in which required girls to wear kurtis below the knee and sleeves below the elbow.



The move followed when few students on Friday were not allowed to enter the college and stopped at the gate as they were wearing kurtis above their knees. Students were warned of a week's suspension for disobedience to the rule. Even students who were accompanied by their parents were also not allowed inside the college premises for violation of dress code.



Students and alumni of the college blazed on social media. “We can't watch their internalised patriarchy ruin our college years by dictating our lifestyles. We cannot be humiliated every day as it is toxic,” posted a student.



“Things have gotten worse as we are being humiliated by the security guards for wearing kurtis that end less than an inch above the knee.”

Women security guards have maintained a vigil against the violation of the dress code which makes the student feel humiliated. “Things have gotten worse as we are being humiliated by the security guards for wearing kurtis that end less than an inch above the knee. We are made to stand outside the college, missing classes and tests,” students said to the daily.



“This college talks about women’s empowerment but it is merely lip service,” said another student. “When we questioned the code, they said a short dress invites men. This is ridiculous. We get good matches only if we wear proper attire.”
