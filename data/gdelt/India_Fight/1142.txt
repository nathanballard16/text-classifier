The Crown is appealing the sentence on the grounds that it did not take into account the gravity of the offence and degree of Delorme’s responsibility.

Delorme also received two eight-year sentences for robbery.

Ricky Cenabre and Karanpal Bhangu, both immigrants, were working alone on the night shift when they were robbed, beaten and shot about 20 minutes apart.

Bhangu, who was 35, had moved from India four months before he was killed. Cenabre, who was 41, had come to Canada five years earlier from the Philippines.

Delorme’s co-accused, Colton Steinhauer, is schedule to go to trial in the spring.

A teenager was convicted in November on two counts of manslaughter for his role in the killings.

Police arrested the youth along with two men following a car chase.
