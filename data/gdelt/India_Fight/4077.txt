Two Indian pilots killed in fighter jet crash

BENGALURU – An Indian Air Force Mirage-2000 trainer fighter jet crashed in southern Indian state of Karnataka today killing both pilots.

The Indian Air Force has confirmed that two senior pilots, identified as Squadron Leader Sameer Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddarth Negi, were killed after they ejected from the aircraft during its take-off run at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru Friday morning.

The incident took place at 10.30 am. The aircraft burst into flames immediately after the crash.

The Mirage 2000 is equipped with 'zero-zero' (zero speed, zero altitude) ejection seats which enable the pilots to bail out even if the aircraft is on the ground and is not moving. It is unclear at what stage of the take-off run the fighter was in when the pilots decided to eject.

Later, by about 11.30am, investigating teams from both IAF and HAL landed at the spot and began vetting the crash site.

After inspecting for about an hour the flight data recorder (FDR)—black box—was recovered, sealed and flown away. At least two choppers were pressed into service soon after the incident, and the wreckage remained at the spot well after lunch, the Times of India reported.

The state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) makes and upgrades aircraft for training and combat operations of the IAF as the country's sole defence behemoth. It also maintains and operates the military airport in Bengaluru.

The IAF operates 50 French-made Mirage 2000 fighters (after Friday's crash) which are in the process of being upgraded. The fighters started entering service in 1985.
