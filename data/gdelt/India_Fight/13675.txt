Amit Shah slams Rahul Gandhi for asking proof for air strike in Pakistani

According to sources BJP president Amit Shah said that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi should feel ashamed of asking for proof of India's air strike on a terror camp in Pakistan. Meanwhile the BJP Leader said people will give Gandhi a reply for (saying) it during the ensuing Lok Sabha polls.









Meanwhile when addressing the party's booth-level workers at Bamora near Sagar town in Madhya Pradesh, Shah said an IAF official at a press conference asserted that the IAF had hit terror targets. Furthermore even after this conclusive statement, Gandhi is insulting thousands of martyrs of India by asking for evidence of the air strike. Reportedly the IAF conducted air strike last month on a camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan, in retaliation to the terror outfit's attack at Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. Shah lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his "work and untiring attitude."





Moreover he said “The country has got a Prime Minister who works for 18 out of 24 hours a day and is very dedicated towards the nation, where Modi government has done in 55 months of rule, the Congress was unable to do in 55 years with Gandhi family's four generations ruling the country”.
