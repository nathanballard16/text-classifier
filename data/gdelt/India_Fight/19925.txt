Film Festival brings the world to Rochester

Around this time of year, many of us start thinking of traveling to destinations far and wide.

Before we take off, though, it’s time for the world to come to us in the guise of the Rochester International Film Festival, which opens April 12 and runs through April 20 at the Marcus cinema.

"We have films this year from every continent in the world, except Antarctica," said Alan Hoffman of the Rochester International Film Group, which organizes the festival.

Last year, the festival expanded to two weekends, and now screens film in two auditoriums at peak times.

Regular attendees know the routine for opening night: live music, food and drink at 6 p.m., with the festival launching at 7 p.m. The opening film is "The Last Suit," from Argentina, followed by "Ruben Brandt, Collector" from Hungary.

A new wrinkle this year, said Hoffman, is that all seats are reserved, in keeping with the Marcus policy for all auditoriums at the complex.

The festival will screen 29 films, with two of them being shown three times, and three of them being shown twice. The lineup includes Oscar nominees, a Cannes Jury Prize winner, and films that have been shown at major festivals, including Sundance, Berlin and South by Southwest.
