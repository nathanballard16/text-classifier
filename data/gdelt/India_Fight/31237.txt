Three-year-old girl run over by school bus in Bengaluru

Bengaluru, Jun 22: A three-year-old girl standing outside her residence was knocked down by a private school bus in Doddamannugudde village, near Ramanagara, on Friday evening.

Ramanagara Rural police said Jeevita R, the only daughter of farmer Rajanna, came under the rear wheel of the bus at 4.30pm and died instantly.

According to police, the bus had come to drop students. Jeevita was standing at the edge of the road in front of her residence, when the bus attached to Strawberry International School arrived. The driver did not notice the girl standing on the left and knocked her down. The rear wheel ran over the child’s head. The driver fled the spot leaving the vehicle behind.

“We learnt about the incident from a few students in the bus. But all of them had left with their parents by the time we reached the spot,” a police officer said.

Police have registered a case of criminal negligence against the driver and have seized the vehicle. “We have contacted the school management and asked them to provide details of the driver; efforts are on to trace him,” an investigating officer said.

This is the second accident involving a school bus this week. Seven-year-old Chintan Ramesh Magadum, a class 1 student at Swargarani School and PU College in Rajarajeshwarinagar, was killed after his own school bus ran over on him. Kengeri traffic police arrested Suresh, the bus driver.
