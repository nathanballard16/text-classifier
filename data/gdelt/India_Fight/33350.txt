NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- At least four Naxals were killed Saturday in a fierce gunfight with government forces in central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, police said.

The gunfight broke out inside forests of Dhamtari district, about 70 km south of Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh.

"This morning a gunfight broke out between Naxals and police in the forest area between Khallari and Mechka villages," a police official posted in Dhamtari said. "During the stand-off four Naxals were killed in the anti-Naxal operation and seven rifles were recovered from the spot."

According to police officials, police teams cordoned off the forest area on specific intelligence information suggesting presence of Naxals in the area.

Policemen involved in the firefight have not suffered any casualty in the stand-off, officials said.

Reports said the gunfight lasted for around five hours.

Currently Naxalites are active in more than a third of India's districts across central and eastern part.
