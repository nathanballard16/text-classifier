Six men convicted in rape case of Muslim girl that shocked India

New Delhi: An Indian court has sentenced three men to life in prison for the abduction, rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in a case that sparked a nationwide furor and inflamed tensions between Hindus and Muslims. Three others were convicted of destroying evidence and punished with a five-year jail term and a fine.

Calling the crime a "barbaric act," state prosecutor JK Chopra said authorities had asked for the death penalty for three of those convicted. A defence lawyer said the Monday verdict would be appealed.

India has struggled with a series of horrifying cases of rape and murder involving children in recent years, and authorities are taking increasingly harsh measures against the culprits.

In the wake of the eight-year-old Asifa Bano's killing last year, India passed legislation making the rape of girls under the age of 12 punishable by death.
