Indian population in Australia increases 30 per cent in less than two years; now the third largest migrant group in Australia

The Indian population in Australia has exponentially grown in the last two years according to the latest figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

The ABS’s preliminary estimates suggest there are 592,000 Indians living in Australia as of June 2018. This is a 30 per cent jump compared to Census 2016 figures which recorded 455,389 Indians living in Australia.

India with 592,000 people moved into third place dropping the New Zealand born (568,000) down to the fourth place.

India now accounts for 2.4% of the Australian population and the median age of an Indian migrant is revealed to be 34 years, same as those born in Australia.

India has been Australia’s biggest source of migrants since 2016.

While 33,310 places of 162,417 permanent places in 2017-18 were granted to Indian citizens, 38,854 visas of 183,608 places went to Indian citizens in 2016-17.

The number of Indian students studying in Australia too ascended to a seven-year high in 2018. According to November 2017 figures, close to 70,000 students were studying in Australian universities and colleges.

Over 7 million migrants were living in Australia as of June 2018, with people born in England continuing to be the largest group of overseas-born residents.

ABS Assistant Director of Migration Statistics Neil Scott said new figures showed that in 2018 just over 29 per cent of Australia's resident population was born overseas.



"Australia's multicultural society is made up of migrants born in every country around the world. Although almost 18 million Australians were born here, our society is continuing to become more culturally diverse over time", Mr Scott said.

China ranked second on this list with 651000 people born in China residing in Australia today.

These figures include temporary visa holders like international students and those on temporary work visas.
