1/3

The BJP is backing its regional satrap Yeddyurappa to bring home the votes in Karnataka, which with 28 seats, is a key battleground state. It’s also the only Southern state where the BJP has a major presence, with a stronghold in the coastal Karnataka.

The BJP won 17 out of the 28 seats in 2014 with JD(S) winning 2 and Congress getting 9. In the Karnataka 2018 Assembly Elections, the BJP managed 104 seats out of 224 but the Congress (80) handed over the CM’s post to JD(S) (34) to keep BJP out of power. Despite last-minute efforts and resort politics, Congress and JD(S) managed to hold their folk together which meant that despite being the single-largest party, the party failed to get power.

Meanwhile, in the bypolls the Cong-JD(S) alliance managed to get two out of the three seats with BJP only retaining Shivamogga.
