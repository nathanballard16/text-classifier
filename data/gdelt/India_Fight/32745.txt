“Sufi saints who talked of Hindu-Muslim unity were murdered and thrown out of Kashmir”

Srinagar: Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday claimed that Sufi saints who talked of Hindu-Muslim unity were murdered and thrown out of Kashmir.

The BJP president made the remarks after moving a resolution in the Rajya Sabha for extending President’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir for a period of six months with effect from July 3 along with the amendment bill of the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Act, 2004.

Shah said,”Sufi tradition had been part of Kashmir? where are they know?

Kashmiri pandits, they were thrown out of the state, were they not part of Kashmiriyat?” He said.

“When Sufis were attacked, Sufi saints were murdered, those who used to talk of Hindu-Muslim unity, they were also thrown out of Kashmir.” Shah claimed.

Shah also tabled the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill that will provide quota in educational institutions and government jobs to those living within 10km of the international border (IB) along the Line of Control (LoC). The House is currently also discussing the statutory resolution for extension of President’s Rule by another six months.

Shah said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government had zero-tolerance towards militancy. “All parties know Kashmir is ours and Kashmir will remain ours,” he said and assured that no one can take Kashmir away from India.
