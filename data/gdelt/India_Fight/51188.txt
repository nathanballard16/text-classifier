Nine months after theft of seized bike, cops file FIR

Ganpat Jagish Barma found his seized bike missing from Dindoli police station

Surat: An unidentified person has been booked for stealing a motorcycle worth Rs40,000 from the custody of Dindoli police station here on Monday.

Ironically, the offence was registered nine months after the theft of the motorcycle that was seized by police for violation of traffic rules. When its owner approached the police station to take its possession after paying the fine in February 2019, it was nowhere to be found.

The offence was registered by Ramesh Amarsinh, assistant sub-inspector (ASI), currently posted in police control room. He was posted at Dindoli police station in the beginning months of this year.

H S Rawat, police sub-inspector, posted at Navagam police chowki of Dindoli police station, had stopped Ganpat Jagish Barma riding motorcycle near Bhim Nagar underpass on the night of December 31, 2018, the FIR says. Barma was not wearing helmet and didn’t posses driving licence either.

The motorcycle was without registration number plate and hence was seized by police. Barma was issued an RTO memo and asked to get the motorcycle released from the police station after paying the fine.

The motorcycle was kept with other seized vehicles in an open area alongside the police station. Barma came to the police station on February 6, 2019 after depositing the fine of Rs2,500 in RTO and completing other formalities to take back the motorcycle. Barma found the motorcycle missing from the police custody and informed actual owner of the motorcycle and his friend Dipchand Chauhan about it. Chauhan submitted a complaint of theft to the police immediately.

“Police don’t have space to keep seized vehicles. This is why it was kept in an open area along with other vehicles but got stolen. I am inquiring why there was a delay in the registration of the offence,” city police commissioner R B Brahmbatt told TOI.
