“All eight personnel were pulled out of the avalanche debris. Seven individuals were critically injured in the incident,” the official said.

Despite best efforts, four soldiers and two civilian porters succumbed to extreme hypothermia, the official said.

The Siachen Glacier at the height of around 20,000 ft in the Karakoram range is known as the highest militarised zone in the world, where the soldiers have to battle frostbite and high winds.

Avalanches and landslides are common at the glacier during the winters and temperatures can drop to as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius.
