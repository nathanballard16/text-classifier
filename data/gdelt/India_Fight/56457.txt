Opinion : India’s protests could be a tipping point against authoritarianism

But unlike the response to previous majoritarian attacks on the rights of Muslim citizens, this time the Modi government has faced unprecedented backlash. Majid Ahmed, a student from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences who held up the Indian tricolor flag at the protests, told me that the country had moved beyond the language of silence: “They lynched us; we remained silent. They attacked our institutions; we remained silent. They built detention centers for Muslims; we remained silent. They called us migrants, referred to us as termites, and we continued to remain numb. But now we cannot take a new wound. The citizenship bill is the biggest challenge to India since the Partition of the country, and we are the freedom fighters.”
