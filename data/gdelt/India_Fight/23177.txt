Srinagar, May 01: The Jammu and Kashmir police say that the Hizbul Mujahideen could have been behind the killing of RSS leader Chanderkant Sharma.

Investigations have found that four persons were involved in the plot to kill Sharma and his PSO Rajinder Kumar. While the police is on the trail of three persons, the fourth is yet to be identified.

He appears to be an outsider, the police said. Even after showing pictures of the man, eye-witnesses were unable to identify him. Police sources say that the Hizbul Mujahideen operatives had purchased the car a day before the attack for around Rs 80,000. They however abandoned the car after the incident. The attack was carried out to fan communal tensions in the state, the officer also added.
