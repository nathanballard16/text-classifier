Bharatiya Janata Party worker Nemichand Tanvar was allegedly shot dead by Congress leader Arun Sharma in Madhya Pradesh's Indore on Sunday. The incident was reported sometime before the polling for the Indore Lok Sabha seat came to an end, police said.

Commenting on the incident, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ruchivardhan Mishra said the 60-year-old BJP leader was shot dead outside his house, possibly with a country-made gun from close range around 5.30 pm.

Sharma's two sons were also present there at the time of the incident, police said.

Tanvar was taken to a nearby hospital, but doctors could not save him, the woman police officer said, adding that the matter was under investigation and a search has been launched to trace the accused.

Meanwhile, in a statement, state BJP president Rakesh Singh said that the murder was a fallout of a political rivalry. Tanvar is a victim of it and he was an active party worker, Singh said.

He also alleged that the main accused in the case, Arun Sharma, is close to state Health Minister Tulsiram Silavat.

He said that Tanvar and his sons were threatened on Sunday afternoon for working in favour of the BJP during the Lok Sabha polls. They were told that they will face dire consequences for their act.

Singh said the accused should be arrested soon and strong legal action must be initiated against him.

Efforts to contact Silavat on the issue proved futile.
