Ludhiana, June 29

In a new twist to Thursday’s violence in Central Jail, Ludhiana, Meera Rani, mother of deceased inmate Ajit Singh (21), on Saturday alleged that her son had been shot by a jail officer in front of her.

“I was at the jail to meet my son. The moment he emerged to meet me, violence erupted in the prison. Policemen started firing, and one of the senior officers shot at my son in front of my eyes. He was then dragged to some other place, and I was also rushed away from the spot,” the mother, wailing inconsolably, alleged.

She, along with Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains, met DCP Ashwani Kapur and demanded the registration of a murder case against jail officials responsible for the firing that resulted in two men being hit.

“The police have hurriedly registered an ‘attempt to murder’ case against 22 inmates. If that could be done while a judicial inquiry is on, why can’t they book the prison officials responsible? Our application has been marked to ADCP-IV Ajinder Singh for inquiry. The police are siding with the jail staff. If an FIR is not registered in two days, we will approach the high court,” the MLA said while speaking to The Tribune.

The mother said they would not cremate the body till a murder case was registered. The DCP said action would be taken on the basis of the ADCP’s inquiry report.
