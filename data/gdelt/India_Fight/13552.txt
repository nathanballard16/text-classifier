SOP being followed to protect airspace around airports: CISF

Assessing the threat perception in the wake of Pulwama terror attack, Rajesh Ranjan DG, CISF said, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is already in place to ensure the safety of airspace around the airport from any intrusive drone devices until the time alternative technology is brought in place.

"The technology which is to be deployed is being studied. Till the time alternative technologies are deployed we have an SOP in place to ensure that the airspace around the airport remains protected from any intrusive drone devices," said Rajesh Ranjan, DG CISF.

"We are operationally prepared for tackling any eventuality. Whenever we get any input from sister agencies about any vulnerability or any particular threat perception we immediately take measures to ensure that those threat perceptions inputs are addressed well and in time," said DG.

"We do a constant assessment of the SOP's in place to ensure that we are ahead of the anti-social and anti- element," he said.

India lost over 40 CRPF personnel in the ghastly February 14 terror attack, following which it launched a pre-emptive, anti-terror strike against a major JeM terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot, where many top JeM commanders and terrorists were killed, according to Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.

Ranjan also said that CISF works in close coordination and synergy with other paramilitary forces and Army to ensure the security of its units.

"At some of the units in Jammu and Kashmir we are barely 1-3 Km from the LoC and we have great synergy with the Army units and other Central Armed Police Forces units working in the area which is why we have been able to hold our positions very strongly," he said.
