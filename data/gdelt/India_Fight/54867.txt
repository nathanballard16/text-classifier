Safety check: Traders ignorant of fire risks, safety procedures

Varanasi: Despite having most of its wholesale markets and power-loom weaving units in congested narrow lanes, the city traders admit ignorance of fire related risks and safety measures.After Sunday’s tragic fire incident in Delhi that claimed over 40 lives, TOI tried to take stock of city’s preparedness in case of any fire accident, on Monday. The firefighters here term Varanasi as one of the most challenging cities for firefighting exercise in case of any untoward incident.As per the fire brigade records, the city has witnessed over 306 fire incidents in past 12 months, however, no casualty was reported in any of these cases. Fire officer Yogendra Chaurasia, recalling an incident of fire in two shops in Narial Bazar area of Chowk in February, said it is difficult to control the situation and rescue stranded people in case of fire in narrow streets.He said that in 2017 fire incident in a plastic pipe wholesale shop-cum-godown in Jalpa area, they had to struggle continuously for over 18 hours to douse the flames while thick fumes left the locals suffering.District general secretary of Chemist and Druggist Welfare Association Sandeep Chaturvedi said in case Delhi-like fire occurs in any of these markets, the number of casualties can’t be guessed as taking fire tenders is not possible in the narrow lanes where these mandis exist. In view of the same, traders’ associations like Sri Varanasi Vyapar Mandal has been demanding the government to explore possibility of establishing wholesale markets and warehousing in city outskirts or along ring-road for over three decades. Unfortunately, the demand failed to attract interest of any public representative, he added.Varanasi Vyapar Mandal president Ajit Singh Bagga said that even weavers operating on powerlooms dwell in congested areas. While the trader fraternity is ignorant of fire safety, the government should make them strictly adhere to the rules and regulations for fire safety by taking them in confidence, said Bagga. A weavers’ leader Mafooz Alam also made it very clear that none of the powerloom operators follow fire safety measures.Chaurasia said that it was shocking to see that traders in congested markets keep their stocks dumped even at stairs and escape routes. Maximum cases of fire are caused due to short circuit but the traders still lack the alertness for replacement of old wiring and switching off the power while closing shops, he said mentioning the outcomes of investigation of department in fire cases that took place in city areas.
