The top court also ordered the transfer of all cases related to Unnao rape incident from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi. However, on a plea filed by the CBI, the Supreme Court on Friday stayed the transfer of cases from Lucknow court to Delhi for 15 days till CBI completes its probe.

The Uttar Pradesh Police filed a case of murder against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and nine others in connection with the accident.

Probe in the case was transferred to the CBI on July 30.

Sengar, a legislator from Bangermau in Unnao district, is accused of allegedly raping the victim at his residence in Unnao on June 4, 2017, where she had gone to seek a job.
