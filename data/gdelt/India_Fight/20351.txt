Alia Bhatt has been hogging a lot of limelight for bagging big Bollywood projects lately.

After Kalank, Alia also has Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Inshallah and SS Rajamouli’s RRR in line for which she still has to start shooting for. However, meanwhile if Alia Bhatt is offered a good Hollywood project, the diva wouldn't give a second thought before taking it. Just like Bollywood queens Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone, Alia also wants to venture into foreign projects and if she gets one in the near future, she would be following the footsteps of her co Bollywood actresses.

In her recent statement to PTI, the Gully Boy actress said, "I do hope to go there (Hollywood) someday and soon. That is like entering a whole new industry and that is not easy at all. I will have to do it with some more time on my hand”.

On working with SS Rajamouli for a Telugu film, Alia added, "He was on my bucket list of directors. Not only because of Baahubali, of course, that was a very big factor but also because of his imagination. Right from Magadheera to Eega, these concepts are simply mind-blowing. He is truly an artist and understands his audience, the people he is making the film for. His emotions and story are so powerful, likewise with RRR, he has a very powerful story to tell."

Meanwhile, Alia Bhatt is busy promoting Kalank along with her co-stars Varun Dhawan, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapoor and others. The period drama is directed by Abhishek Varman and is all set to release on April 17th.
