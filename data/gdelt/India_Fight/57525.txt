Punjab CM slams action to stop Rahul, Priyanka

Chandigarh, Dec 24 : Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday condemned the Uttar Pradesh government's action in stopping Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from crossing into Meerut to meet families of the victims of the anti-CAA protests.

Terming it an uncalled for action, the Punjab Chief Minister slammed the UP government for the spate of curbs it has imposed on the opposition and citizens protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

In fact, he said, Rahul and Priyanka were travelling to Meerut not to protest but to share the grief of the kin of those killed in the recent police clashes with protesters.

Reports indicate that the Congress leaders had even offered to go in groups of three, instead of collectively, but were prevented from entering Meerut.

The Chief Minister earlier tweeted: "Strongly condemn the UP govt's decision to stop @RahulGandhi & @priyankagandhi from travelling into Meerut to meet the families of the victims of the #CAAProtests. What India needs at this moment is a healing touch and not such curbs against opposition parties.".

Protest is the democratic right of every citizen of India but the Uttar Pradesh government has been acting in a draconian manner to crack the whip on protesting citizens as if they were terrorists or gangsters, said Amarinder, citing instances of protesters being killed, maimed or arrested in police action.
