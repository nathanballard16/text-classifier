With China's help, Pakistan busy erasing digital trail of Pulwama attack: Intel sources

Amid mounting global pressure to act against the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack, Pakistan has begun erasing the digital footprint with the help of Chinese cyber experts.

In the worst terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men were killed when a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into a paramilitary convoy. Masood Azhar-led Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) had claimed responsibility for the attack.

Even as India launched airstrikes to target a JeM training camp in Pakistan's Balakot, New Delhi has called Islamabad to dismantle terror groups operating on its territory. A dossier was handed over to Pakistan with "specific details of JeM complicity in Pulwama terror attack and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan."

The Ministry of External Affairs conveyed that India expects Pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from territories under its control. Global pressure has also been mounting on Pakistan to act against the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack.

However, intelligence sources gathered evidence that Pakistan has begun erasing the digital footprint with the help of Chinese cyber experts.
