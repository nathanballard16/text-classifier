New Delhi: The world observes International Tiger Day on Monday, July 29, with an aim to conserve the endangered species, that is a tiger. Around 100 years ago, there were nearly a hundred thousand tigers in Asia, but now they are reduced to a small number that lives in the wild. A huge number of tigers died in the last century alone due to hunting, poaching, man-animal conflict and because their habitats have thinned due to human encroachment in the forest areas.

Tiger is India's national animal. But lack of an intensive animal protection regimen means the hapless animals have to bear the brunt of the vices and follies of the most useless and most dangerous animal of them all - MAN! Of late there have been a number of incidents where the big cats were either beaten to death or were shot dead by poachers or villagers. While it cannot be denied that human life is precious and that tigers or any species of animals attacking human settlements are not a happy scenario, it is also true that the problem begs a better solution than lynching tigers to death. Remember, the jungle (and therefore the ecosystem) is as healthy as the variety of wild animals in it.
