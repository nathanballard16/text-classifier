Students across India protest new citizenship law after clashes on campuses

The most violent protests during the past few day took place in the northeastern state of Assam, where mobs torched buildings and train stations, angry the law would help thousands of immigrants from Bangladesh become lawful citizens.

At least two people were killed in the violent clashes with police.

Under the law passed by parliament last week, religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians in neighbouring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who have settled in India prior to 2015 will have a path to Indian citizenship on grounds they faced persecution in those countries.



Critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens India's secular foundations.

Protests were held in Mumbai's Indian Institute of Technology and Tata Institute of Social Sciences overnight and on Monday and more were planned at Bombay University and in the southern city of Bengaluru later in the day.

Students said they also stood in solidarity with fellow student in Delhi who clashed with police in Delhi on Sunday.

"The country is burning, the government has made a mockery of the constitution," said D Raja, a general secretary of the Communist Party of India.
