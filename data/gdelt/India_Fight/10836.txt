India and Pakistan are on a razor’s edge. On Wednesday, both countries shot down each other’s fighter jet in Jammu and Kashmir. An Indian Air Force pilot has been captured by Pakistan. Airspace over western parts of India and also in Pakistan was closed for civilian flights, indicating further escalation.

The Line of Control (LoC) is on high alert and there is constant firing from across both sides. The IAF bases are in a state of readiness.

Islamabad targeted three places close to the LoC and adjacent to India’s forward “military bases”. Sources indicated that India did not hit any military target, only the Balakot terror camp and that the Pakistan strike is escalatory in nature.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been briefed on the preparedness of the forces with the three service chiefs laying out the options. In J&K, Indian fighters chased the PAF out, but lost a plane. Also, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by Pakistan.

Though there has been no loss on the ground, the fact that Pakistan chose targets close to military establishments and then held a press conference to say it wanted to “show its capability” has riled the Indian establishment.

The MEA said: “The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the IAF responded instantly. A Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG-21 Bison. The Pakistani aircraft was seen falling from the sky on the Pakistan side.” It did not specify which plane.

Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, DG, Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan, said: “We had the option to fire at them (India), but did not target their supply depots. We wanted to show we can do everything, but don’t want to at the cost of peace.”
