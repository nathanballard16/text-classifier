One more big cat dies in Gir region

Ahmedabad: A lion was found dead in a farmland in Junagadh district of Gujarat on Monday, with initial observation indicating infighting as the cause, a forest department official said.

The carcass of the big cat, aged 4-5 years, was found in the agricultural land of a farmer, Kalu Rathod, said Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife Circle, Junagadh, D T Vasavada. The farmland is located under Jasadhar range of Gir East division of forest in Junagadh district, he said.

The farm owner informed the Forest Department after which officials rushed to the spot, Vasavada said. “As per primary observation by staff, the reason of death seems to be infighting,” he said.

Over 200 lions have died in the Gir forest region in Gujarat in the last two years, the Gujarat government told the legislative assembly on Friday last week.

To a query by Congress MLA Bhagabhai Barad, Forest Minister Ganpat Vasava, in a written reply, said 110 lions and 94 cubs had died in 2017 and 2018.
