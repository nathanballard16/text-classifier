India's Modi announces anti-satellite missile test

India successfully test-fired an anti-satellite weapon Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, in what was an unexpected announcement of military advancement, that was broadcast live just weeks before a general election.

The prime minister told viewers that India was now a 'space superpower', joining an exclusive club of nations capable of destroying satellites in orbit. The announcement is likely to raise already-strained tensions, in the region.

Earlier this month India and Pakistan's airforces clashed after the Indian government launched airstrikes against terrorist training sites in the disputed region of Kashmir. Pakistan retaliated the following day by shooting down an Indian airforce plane - capturing the pilot.

Both nuclear-armed countries have taken positive steps in the last two weeks to de-escalate the situation, but mistrust and tensions continue to run high.
