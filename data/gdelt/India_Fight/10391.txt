Indian chopper crashes in Budgam, two pilots killed - Breaking News

An Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper crashed in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam this morning killing two pilots, Indian media reported.

The crash had taken place in the backdrop of heavy shelling and firing from across the border on a day IAF fighter jets crossed the Line of Control and destroyed a vast terror camp within Pakistan in a pre-dawn strike on Tuesday.

According to NDTV, there were reports of Pakistani fighter jets violating Indian air space in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch and Rajouri sectors.

A Pakistani F-16 aircraft crashed on its territory, in the Lam Valley area along the Line of Control.

Visuals showed the wrecked fuselage of the IAF chopper in flames and a large number of villagers standing around it.

The helicopter, a Russian made Mi-17, crashed in an open field near Garend Kalaan village in Budgam at 10.05 am.

The Mi-17 chopper broke into two and caught fire immediately, the officials said.

The area has been on high alert amid warnings of retaliation after the air strikes by India yesterday.
