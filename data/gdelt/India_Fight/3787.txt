Katrina Kaif denies being approached for a film with Mahesh Babu - details inside

Here are all the details

We owe a lot to Tollywood for giving us superstar Mahesh Babu who is undoubtedly one of the finest performers we've ever seen. Whether it's Okkadu or Pokiri, Tollywood's Prince has carved a niche for himself to become a superstar that he is. The dapper star has been busy shooting for his next release, Maharishi. But apart from Maharishi, it's his next project that has left the audience.

Various reports have been doing the rounds that Mahesh will be sharing screen space with Bollywood hottie, Katrina Kaif. Crashing our hopes, Katrina spoke to DNA and finally put an end to all those rumours by saying, "I haven’t signed anything after Bharat. As for your question, no, I haven’t even been approached for the film."

While we eagerly hope for a collaboration between Mahesh and Kat to materialise, the hottie has been busy shooting for her next, Ali Abbas Zafar's Bharat opposite Salman Khan. Kat has also walked out of Varun Dhawan starrer, ABCD's third installment. Speaking about it, she added, "It wasn’t possible for me to do that movie, given the timeline for Bharat. We are pushing for an Eid release, so we had to finish shooting this one. That’s very critical for the film. The dates became a problem and I had to opt out of that one. "

On the other hand, Mahesh has been busy shooting for his next release, Maharishi along with Pooja Hegde that is slotted to release on April 25. Stay tuned for all the updates.
