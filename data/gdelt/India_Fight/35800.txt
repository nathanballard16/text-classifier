Akshay Kumar on working in Hollywood films: I'm very happy doing films in Bollywood

The Khiladi of Bollywood, Akshay Kumar is currently busy gearing up for his next release Mission Mangal. The science fiction drama is directed by Jagan Shakti and jointly produced by Akshay Kumar, R. Balki, Aruna Bhatia, and Anil Naidu. The film is scheduled to release in India on 15 August 2019 and also stars Vidya Balan, Taapsee Pannu, Nithya Menen, Kirti Kulhari, Sharman Joshi, H. G. Dattatreya and Sonakshi Sinha. It is loosely based on the story of scientists at Indian Space Research Organisation who contributed to the Mars Orbiter Mission.

In a recent interview, the action king was asked why he has never signed a Hollywood film. The actor shared, “I wouldn’t say I’ve not been offered Hollywood films, but whatever came wasn’t big enough or that great. And I’m very happy doing films in Bollywood.” He continued to add, “If something very good and effective comes that lets me show my talent in a better way, I would love to do it.”

Akshay Kumar was last seen on the big screen in Kesari, based on the true story of one of the bravest battles that India ever fought – the Battle of Saragarhi. 2019 is going to be quite a busy year for him with an interesting line up of upcoming films such as Sooryavanshi, Housefull 4, Good News and Laxmmi Bomb.
