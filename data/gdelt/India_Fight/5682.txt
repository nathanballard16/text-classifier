Thais arrest Chinese man for murder of elderly woman

A young Chinese man was arrested in Surat Thani after an elderly woman was murdered and valuables stolen from a Bangkok condominium early yesterday, the Bangkok Post reports.

The 29-year-old suspect, Wu Zhuoming was arrested by immigration police at a pier in Surat Thani as he was about to board a boat to Koh Samui in the tourist province.

He was initially charged with murder, and was to be handed over to police in Bangkok.

Araya Sapsawan, a 70-year-old Thai-Chinese woman, was found dead in her condominium on Soi Phahol Yothin 52, in Bangkok’s Sai Mai district, in the early hours of yesterday, Thai media reported. Relatives told police that the woman's 3 baht-weight gold necklace and a gold ring were missing. They said a Chinese man contacted her two days ago to return money he had stolen while renting a room from her two years ago.

The man had stolen her ATM card and withdrawn 400,000 baht in cash, said Pol Col Amnart Intharasuan, chief of Bang Khen police station.

Footage from closed-circuit television cameras captured the Chinese suspect leaving the victim’s room. The man was seen carrying a rope.
