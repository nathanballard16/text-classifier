Here’s how your favourite celebrities are wearing tank tops right now

It’s not often we pause to study the origins of the pieces that populate our closet, especially basics that routinely come to our rescue. The tank top is one such staple, that one piece you can always count on to top off a look with zero effort. But did you know that your current tank tops are actually an evolved variant of the swimsuit? When women’s swimming was first introduced at the Olympic Games in 1912, participants wore tops not unlike modern-day tank tops with shorts, and this eventually came to be known as the tank suit. But in the ’30s and ’40s, tank tops got a bad rep as they were often worn by the quintessential bad boys in popular Hollywood movies of the time. For example, Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. By the ’70s, however, tank tops had integrated themselves into the mainstream wardrobe, and continue to enjoy that position till date.

The reason for the piece’s enduring popularity? Versatility, of course. The tank top, be it in neutral hues or pop colours, gives you an almost blank canvas to build your look upon. Take the trending neon lime top and khaki pants combination, spotted on a handful of stars including Kiara Advani, for instance. An easy casual look, it can take you through a day of errands in utmost comfort, and you only need to pair it with a khaki blouse and some jewellery for a sartorial upgrade.
