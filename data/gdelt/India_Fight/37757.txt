Will exercise all possible options to counter 'illegal' steps: Pakistan on Article 370

Condemning the government's move on Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, a statement from Pakistan's foreign office said that it will exercise all possible options to counter the 'illegal' steps.

Pakistan said that it strongly condemned and rejected the announcements made today by the Indian Government regarding Jammu and Kashmir.

Calling Jammu and Kashmir as "an internationally recognized disputed territory", Pakistan stated, "No unilateral step by the Government of India can change this disputed status, as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Nor will this ever be acceptable to the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Pakistan."

"Pakistan reaffirms its abiding commitment to the Kashmir cause and its political, diplomatic and moral support to the people of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir for realization of their inalienable right to self-determination," the statement added.

Earlier in the day, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that India's decision to revoke Article 35A, has resurrected Kashmir problem.

Shah Mehmood Qureshi said, "The move to abolish Article 35A has left India's so-called democratic face open to the world. The Kashmir leadership does not agree with India's decision. India has resurrected the Kashmir problem with its decison."

On Monday, the government moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to repeal Article 370 of the Constitution which accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

Union minister Amit Shah also moved a bill proposing bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir division and Ladakh.
