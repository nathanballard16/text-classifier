Aurangzeb was part of the team that undertook the Sameer Tiger encounter. The dreaded Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist was taken down in an encounter April 2018. The abducted soldier along with a Major and his team were on the radar of the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist.

The threat perception to this team of the Rashtriya Rifles was high. The jawan was a PSO to Major Rohit Shukla who it may be recalled was challenged by Sameer Tiger ahead of the encounter.
