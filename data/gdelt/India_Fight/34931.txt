'Hang Kulbhushan at Wagah border': Veena Malik loses it after ICJ stays Jadhav's execution

In a tweet in which she managed to misspell both his first name and surname, Malik wrote: “There should be no mercy for the killer and terrorist Kulbushan (sic) Jhadav (sic). As you sow so shall you reap, so hang him at wagah to set example for the others spy and Indian terrorists.”

Pak actor Veena Malik, who shot to fame during her infamous stint in Bigg Boss, had her unique hot take on the Kulbhushan Jadhav verdict.

Malik, who in the past has crossed daggers with Sania Mirza and tried to blame her for Pak’s defeat against India and made highly uncharitable comments about the missing AN-32 plane, appeared to jump on the Kulbhushan Jadhav bandwagon even as the ICJ chastised Pakistan on a global forum.

Commenting on the ICJ verdict, even as a forlorn Islamabad promised to abide by the law, Malik demanded that Jadhav be hanged at Wagah border!

In a tweet in which she managed to misspell both his first name and surname, Malik wrote: “There should be no mercy for the killer and terrorist Kulbushan (sic) Jhadav (sic). As you sow so shall you reap, so hang him at wagah to set example for the others spy and Indian terrorists.”

Earlier, Malik had made a horrendous comment when an Indian Air Force plane had gone missing with 11 airmen on board.

She had written: “IAF An-32 hasn't crashed. Weather is too CLOUDY and Radars can't detect it - Military Scientist, PM Shree #NarendraModi @IAF_MCC @narendramodi," she wrote and also added a smiley face emoji to her already inconsiderate tweet.
