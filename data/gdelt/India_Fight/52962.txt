Anupam Kher's Hotel Mumbai releases today, garners praises as being relevant

November 29 : Anupam Kher, Dev Patel and Armie Hammer starrer Hotel Mumbai releases today. Helmed by Australian director Anthony Maras, the film created a buzz since its shooting started. It traces the terror attack on Taj Mahal Palace in Colaba, one of Mumbai’s prominent hotels, on November 26, 2008.

More than a decade later, the film showcases the “extraordinary courage of ordinary people” and revisits the wounds of the people of Mumbai. Anthony Maras went one step ahead and used the actual footage of accused Ajmal Kasab's police confession in the film. An emotional Anupam Kher took to his Instagram handle and shared a poster of the film and wrote, “Our film Hotel Mumbai releases today in India!! It is the most important film of our times. Do watch it. Extraordinary courage of ordinary people.” Neena Gupta, a good friend of Anupam Kher, wished him and the film good luck. “Good luck my dear,” she wrote on the comment section.

Earlier, director Ram Gopal Varma made an attempt in 2013 to capture the tragic night at Taj Mahal. Unfortunately, The Attacks Of 26/11, couldn’t make any impact as his film looked like documentary. On the other hand, Anthony Maras' Hotel Mumbai treated the fateful night and its related incidents as a suspense drama. Without much ado, Hotel Mumbai takes us into the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai, where the heinous terrorist massacres took place, and gets into the actual incidents that took place on that fateful night. Anthony Maras let the film talk rather than using any loud background score or any dramatic camera tricks.

Anupam Kher portrays the role of chef Hemant Oberoi, who played a key role in rescuing people on that fateful night. Even before the film releases, Kher has been praised for his performance. Critics described his performance as “gripping” and “remarkable”.
