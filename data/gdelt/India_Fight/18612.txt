If there is one star in Bollywood who is riding very high on a streak of back to back successful films, then it is none other than Ranveer Singh. The star of Gully Boy is also an ardent Hip Hop lover and a big fan of Hollywood star Will Smith. Naturally, when Will got in touch with Ranveer Singh for his show Bucket List, he couldn’t say no to the man behind hit song ‘Gettin Jiggy with It’. Will Smith wanted to shoot an episode for his reality show, ‘Bucket List’ on how things work in Bollywood and he asked Ranveer Singh and Karan Johar for tips.



In the video, we can see Will flying from the States to India and landing in Mumbai, which is considered as the city of dreams. He first meets Ranveer Singh and they both talk about how movies and songs are shot in Bollywood movies. Ranveer then informs Will that when songs are shot in Bollywood films, it is more like a carnival. Post this, Ranveer takes Will to see a video of his song Tattad Tattad from his film Goliyon Ki Rasleela- Ram Leela. On seeing the video of the song, Will feels the energy of Bollywood and does a few steps with Ranveer.



In the second part of the video, Will meets Karan Johar and Ranveer Singh to take tips from them on how to gear up for his big Bollywood dream. Karan Johar tells him that Student of the Year 2 is being shot and he can be a part of a song. Karan and Ranveer school Will on Bollywood dancing and they all seem to be having a gala time. Post the meeting, Will is nervous but eventually makes it to the sets of Student of the Year 2 and dances it out with the news students Ananya Pandey, Tara Sutaria and Tiger Shroff on a reprised version of Radha. With this, Will’s journey in Bollywood comes to an end on a happy note.
