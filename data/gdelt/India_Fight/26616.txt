Woman found dead in Meharban was strangulated: Police

Ludhiana: The post-mortem of a woman who was found dead in Meharban has ascertained strangulation as the cause of death.

Two minor injuries have also been found on the chest and arm of the woman. To check if she was sexually assaulted before murder, doctors have sent swabs of her vagina to Kharar-based Forensic Science Laboratory.

Even after four days of the body being found, the woman is yet to be identified.

The woman’s body was found from the fields near Kaneja village of Meharban on May 17. Farm workers saw the body and raised the alarm, following which villagers reached the spot and informed the police. Though the woman was wearing clothes, police have not ruled out the possibility of sexual assault before murder.

Assistant commissioner of police (east) Devinder Chaudhary said the post-mortem report had ascertained strangulation as the cause of death. According to doctors, there were no visible marks of sexual assault on the body, but the swab samples would help keep the investigation watertight.

Chaudhary said they had circulated pictures of the woman at all nearby villages and police stations.

He said they had scanned footage of CCTVs installed near the spot where the body was found, but could not get any clues.
