Lawyers coordination committee Chairman Advocate Mahavir Sharma said, "We refused to talk as from the side of the police only Joint CP Rajesh Khurana was present in the meeting." Two special cops, DCP and Joint CP were supposed to attend the meeting.

An argument over the parking issue led to clashes between the lawyers and the Delhi Police in Tis Hazari court complex on November 2. People from both sides received injuries during the violent confrontation.

The issue has since then snowballed, with the protest by the lawyers seeking the arrest of police personnel involved in the clashes entering the fourth day on Thursday. Aggrieved by the incident, the Delhi Police had on Tuesday staged an unprecedented protest at police headquarters seeking the arrest of the lawyers.
