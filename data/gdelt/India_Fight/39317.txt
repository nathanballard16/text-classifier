CPI leader criticises Centre, Jammu and Kashmir Governor

The manner in which the Central government pursued its agenda might cause repercussions, said R.Mutharasan, State secretary, Communist Party of India, on Tuesday.

Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, he condemned the government for taking the route of Presidential notification to scrap the Article 370 which conferred special status for Jammu and Kashmir. It bypassed Parliamentary and Legislative procedure.

Actions of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satya Pal Malik, was against well laid norms of the cConstitution. Those holding such positions were not expected to toe the path of politicians.

The Governor responded to the criticism of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in a manner like any other politician would do. Though he invited Rahul Gandhi to see in person the situation prevailing in the bifurcated State, he ensured that D.Raja of the CPI and Sitaram Yechury of the CPM were prevented from visiting the State though a letter about their plan to call on an ailing former MLA at Jammu had been forwarded to the Governor. Even the son of the soil, Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress, was not allowed to enter Jammu.

Such authoritarian activities including the one that had been unleashed on students of the Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, recently for having a discussion among themselves on the issue of scrapping of Article 370 in the CUTN campus, were unwarranted.

Curbing the movement of political leaders and crippling freedom of speech would cause repercussions, he warned.
