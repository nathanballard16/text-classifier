The young girl, who belonged to a Muslim nomadic tribe, was brutally murdered in January 2018. The eight-year-old was drugged, raped and tortured for days on end, having been targeted because the men wished to terrorise the tribe - known as Gujjars - into leaving. The six men are due to be sentenced later today, and face a minimum sentence of life imprisonment and a maxium sentence of the death penalty.

The victim went missing in January 2018 and her battered body was found in a forest near Kathua city almost three weeks after she disappeared.

Police investigators say the child was confined to a local temple, where she was heavily sedated and gang-raped by at least three men over the course of four days.

The police report described the girl as an: “Innocent budding flower, a child of only eight years of age, who being a small kid became a soft target.”

Investigators said the attack was planned, in an effort to create fear among the Muslim tribe and force them to leave the village.
