‘A Little Princess’

Break out your box of tissues. A Little Princess, first released in 1995, is now available to stream on Hulu. When Sara Crewe’s (Liesel Matthews) father goes off to fight in World War I, he sends Sara to a prestigious boarding school in New York, a far cry from their home in India. But when news circulates that her father has been killed in action, Sara is left orphaned and penniless. To make matters worse, the school’s headmistress confiscates the young girl’s possessions and forces her into a life of servitude. But no matter, she gets by with the help of close friends and her fanciful imagination. So, basically, it’s Annie in reverse. A Little Princess is a heartwarming story that just so happens to be Oscar-nominated and critically-acclaimed as well (hello 97% on Rotten Tomatoes). Grab a blanket, a hot cup of something, and give this one a try.
