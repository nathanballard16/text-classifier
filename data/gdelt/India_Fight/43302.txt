A Pakistan Army soldier embraced martyrdom as Indian forces violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) on Thursday.



“Indian troops resorted to unprovoked fire in Hajipir Sector. Sepoy Ghulam Rasool, a resident of Bahawalnagar embraced shahadat,” the Inter-Services Public Relations, the military's media wing said in a statement.



Ceasefire violations have surged since August 5 when New Delhi revoked the special status of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed states.



The Foreign Office has summoned Indian officials several times to condemn the unprovoked firing.



On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi warned that the situation in IOK risked sparking an “accidental war”, and urged UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to visit the troubled region.
