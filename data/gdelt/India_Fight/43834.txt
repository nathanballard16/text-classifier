After SRK, Aamir Khan ropes in Yogi Babu

If reliable sources in tinsel town are to be believed, Yogi Babu, the star comedian of Tamil cinema who earlier did a small comic role in Shah Rukh Khan's Chennai Express, has been approached by yet another Bollywood biggie in Aamir Khan. The makers of Lal Singh Chaddha, an official remake of Tom Hank's Forrest Gump, where Aamir will be seen playing the lead are considering Yogi Babu for a crucial role.

Yogi’s character is only in the realm of speculation now about whether he is being considered to play Bubba, who dies fighting in the Vietnam War alongside Forrest Gump. His is one of the vital characters in the film that has a lot of humour and emotional elements. In a recent interview, Yogi revealed that he has indeed been approached for Aamir's flick and that he is working out his dates.

One may recall our earlier report that Vijay Sethupathi has also been roped in for Lal Singh Chaddha after Aamir visited him on the sets of his film Sanga Tamizhan at Pollachi.

VSP had also confirmed that he would be working in an Aamir Khan film later.
