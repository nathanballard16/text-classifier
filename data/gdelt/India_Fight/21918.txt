Missing Rs 6.65 crore: Not part of raiding team, claim 2 Punjab ASIs

PATIALA: Mohali additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal on Tuesday allowed arguments over the bail application moved by two absconding assistant sub-inspectors of the Punjab Police , who had reportedly disappeared with Rs 6.65 crores seized from the Jalandhar residence of Father Anthony Madaseery.The court has reserved its order for Wednesday.The ASIs -- Joginder Singh and Rajpreet Singh - had moved the bail application last Friday, saying there was no official record confirming their role in the team that raided the priest's house at Pratappura village in Jalandhar on March 29. Their counsel B S Bhullar said the duo was in Patiala as they were neither part of the raiding team nor had they been transferred to Khanna. He also challenged why the FIR was registered against three persons only - the two ASI and police informer Surinder Singh - and not against 30 unidentified policemen who, according to the complaint filed by Father Anthony, had raided his residence on March 29. He argued that there was no CCTV footage available to establish that the two ASIs were a part of the raiding team.Bhullar also contended that since the two ASIs had presented themselves before the SIT constituted to investigate the allegations levelled by Father Anthony, they should be granted bail.However, the prosecution argued that police investigators had credible inputs pointing to the involvement of the two ASIs and the fact that they had now gone underground should be taken into consideration while pronouncing the order on their bail application.According to the FIR registered by Mohali police on the recommendation of the SIT, which is based on the complaint filed by Father Anthony, a team of Khanna police had raided the Pratappura house, from where they had seized Rs 16.54 crores. While Khanna SSP Dhruv Dhahiya held a press conference, stating that Rs 9.66 crores of unaccounted money was seized from Father Anthony near Doraha, the priest had given a complaint to the Jalandhar Police commissioner the next day, claiming that the cops took away Rs 16.54 crores and had tendered Rs 9.65 crores only to the income tax authorities.Following these allegations, a SIT was constituted which later recommended registered of an FIR against the two ASIs and Surinder Singh, who was subsequently arrested.
