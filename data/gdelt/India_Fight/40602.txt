Indian Air Force probe finds friendly fire caused February 27 Budgam chopper crash, 5 officers in dock

An Indian Air Force inquiry has found five officers guilty for the crash of a helicopter in friendly fire over Srinagar in February 27 when India and Pakistan were engaged in a short aerial battle.

The helicopter was shot down by an Indian missile when Indian air defences were on high alert following the February 26 Balakot airstrike that targetted a terrorist camp in Pakistan. The helicopter crashed near Budgam, killing all six Indian Air Force personnel on board.

"Five officers have been found blameworthy by the court of inquiry and the report has been sent to the Air Headquarters for further action," government sources said.

The officers found guilty of negligence and not following procedures include one Group Captain, two Wing Commanders and two Flight Lieutenants, sources said.

Air Marshal Hari Kumar was the Western Air Command chief at the time of the incident.

The helicopter was shot down around the same time when Indian and Pakistani fighter jets got into a rare aerial battle over Jammu and Kashmir. The aerial battle was a result of Pakistani jets launching a counter-attack in response to the Balakot air strikes.

Indian air defences were on their highest state of alert as a result of the Pakistani air intrusion. It was right then that the Mi-17 V-5 chopper of the 154 Helicopter Unit took off. It crashed within 10 minutes after taking off after being hit by an Indian air defence missile.
