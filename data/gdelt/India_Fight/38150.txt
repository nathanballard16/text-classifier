Pati Patni Aur Woh: Kartik Aaryan & Aparshakti crack up in a BTS pic & we wonder what the joke is

Kartik Aaryan has been making headlines, both for his films and love life. Talking about his films, the Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety actor is currently shooting in Lucknow for the remake of B R Chopra’s film Pati Patni Aur Woh co-starring Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday and as for his love life, the actor is in news for his alleged love affair with Sara Ali Khan. As much as we don’t want to believe this piece of news but thanks to social media, we are often treated to Sara and Kartik’s videos wherein the two are seen holding hands, hugging each other, and dropping one another at the airport.



That said, today, Aparshakti Khurrana, who also stars in Pati Patni Aur Woh, took to social media to share a picture from the sets of the film and in the photo, we can only see Kartik’s back as he is wearing an all-black attire while Aparshakti, Mudassir Aziz and others share a laugh. In the film, Kartik Aaryan will be seen playing the role of Chintu Tyagi and Bhumi will be essaying the role of his wife and Ananya will be Kartik’s secretary. In the film, Kartik will be seen sporting a moustache and as soon as Kartik’s first look was unveiled, netizens were quick to draw a comparison of Chintu Tyagi and Shah Rukh Khan’s look in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi.



Besides Pati Patni Aur Woh, soon, Kartik will start shouting for the sequel to Karan Johar’s Dostana titled Dostana 3 opposite Janhvi Kapoor and the shooting of the film, reportedly, will kick-start in October.
