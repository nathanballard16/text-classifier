Prime Minister Narendra Modi, without naming Pakistan, today said those who had lost wars were now using terrorism as a tool in an attempt to meet their goals. He blamed Pakistan for having repeatedly played dirty tricks over Kashmir since Independence.

“In 1999, during the Kargil war, they were repelled yet again like they were in 1948, 1965 and 1971,” the PM said. He was speaking at an event here to mark 20 years of the Kargil victory. “The Kargil victory represented India’s resolve, restraint, capability, discipline and dignity.The neighbour had thought they could alter the alignment of the Line of Control, but they never assessed that we would give a strong reply,” he said.

India and Pakistan had fought the war in May-July 1999 along the 168-km Himalayan ridgeline that forms the Mushkoh-Drass-Kargil-Batalik-Turtuk axis of the LoC. PM Modi said the world faced asymmetric warfare. “Terrorism poses a big threat to the world”, he said adding that global powers needed to stand in unity, if terrorism was to be eliminated.

In securing India’s interests, “we will not work under any influence or pressure”, be it the nuclear triad or conduct of anti-satellite test,” he stressed. “From under the sea to space, India will use its full power to protect itself”. He said the modernisation of the armed forces was as per this line of thought. “The armed forces need jointness (need to operate together)”. Governments, he observed, did not fight wars, the entire nation did.

The PM paid homage to the Kargil braveheart “who shed blood for the country, and their mothers.”
