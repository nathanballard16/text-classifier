Pakistan shoots down two Indian jets

AKIPRESS.COM - Pakistan says it has shot down two India Air Force jets in its airspace in Kashmir and arrested one pilot on the ground, BBC reports.



Military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said one of the planes had fallen in Pakistan-controlled territory while the other fell in Indian territory.

On Tuesday India launched strikes against militants in Pakistan.

Those raids were in retaliation for a militant attack on Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Tensions have been high since the 14 February suicide attack on an Indian paramilitary police convoy, which killed at least 40 soldiers.
