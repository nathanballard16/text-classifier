As per the Prosecution, the case dates back to May 29, 2017, when the body of the ricksahw puller, victim Sukh Ram was found with his throat slit, in the verandah of the NRI branch of State Bank of India at Sector 17, Chandigarh.

The police had then arrested 20-year-old unemployed youngster, Suraj Giri Goswami. The accused Goswami was under the influence of alcohol and had attacked the rickshaw puller with a butcher knife. As per the police, the motive behind the murder was Sukh Ram catching Goswami while he was trying to steal money from him. A fight broke out between the two and Goswami attacked the rickshaw puller with a butcher knife.

During the trial, the defence counsel argued that Goswami had been falsely implicated in the case and had no involvement in the murder of Ram.

The court, however, after hearing the arguments and facts of the case, held the accused guilty and sentenced him to jail for life.
