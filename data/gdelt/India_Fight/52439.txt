We detained them and asked them to tell the truth. Following sustained grilling, they broke down and confessed to having committed the murder.”Both the accused--one woman’s father and the other woman’s uncle--have been arrested in this regard. Search operations are underway in Ganga as Sartaj’s body is yet to be recovered. Police were gathering evidence against the two accused, said a police officer.
