India carried out a strike on a terror camp across the Line of Control, according to reports. The strike was carried out at around 3:30 this morning, according to reports. 12 Mirage 2000 jets took part in the operation that dropped 1,000 kg bombs on a terror camp across the Line of Control, completely destroying it, news agency ANI reported, quoting Air Force sources.

The reported strike come nearly two weeks after the terror attack in Pulwama in which over 40 soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) laid down their lives. Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack. On September 29, 2016, the army had carried out surgical strikes on seven terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in retaliation to an attack on its base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri earlier that month.
