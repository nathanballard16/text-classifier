Suriya: I am a huge fan of Selvaraghavan and his craft!

At the trailer and audio launch of his upcoming film ‘NGK’, Suriya said: “I still remember the first time I met Selvaraghavan, we saw the visuals of Kadhal Kondein at an edit room located opposite Madras Talkies. I expressed my wish to act with him, which eventually happened 16 years with NGK”.





“I would say that Selvaraghavan’s work is ahead of time. NGK is his take on politics and the way he extracts performance from his actors is unique. Even after being so many years in the industry, I unlearned myself to learn something new in NGK. If request Selva to approach me whenever he writes a new script”, added Suriya who called the director as Steven Selvaberg and thus compared him with Steven Spielberg.





Suriya also lauded Yuvan Shankar Raja for his timeless songs and background score. “I feel glad to have acted with the magical combo of Selvaraghavan and Yuvan Shankar Raja”. Suriya said that Sai Pallavi is a dedicated actress and always try to improvise her performance despite director is fine with what she delivered.





The Singam actor said that there are many long shots in the film so the performance of actors must be flawless to hold the scenes. On the delay in releasing NGK, Suriya said: “I had my own health issues, Selva was ill for a few months and there was industry strike so the film took its own time”.
