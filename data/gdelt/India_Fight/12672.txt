Bareilly: The fear of monkeys has gripped residents of Sambhal district in Uttar Pradesh where the primates have caused the deaths of two locals in less than 24 hours. The most recent instance has come to light from Kaithal village of Chandausi subdivision where a 60-year-old woman died after being chased by a pack of monkeys on Saturday.

Going by reports, the deceased has been identified as one Laungshree. She was cooking food in a corner of her open terrace when several monkeys attacked her and snatched the 'chapattis' on Saturday afternoon, her kin told Times of India. She tried to shoo away the primates but lost her balance and fell off the terrace, they added. The elderly woman was rushed to the nearest hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.

A similar incident was reported from the neighbouring Maulagarh village where a 20-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries on Friday after being attacked by monkeys. The boy, Rakesh, was standing on the terrace of his house when two monkeys attacked him. He lost his balance and fell off the terrace, the deceased's kin told the national daily.

Locals have registered several complaints in this regard in recent weeks. Responding to their pleas, Chandausi sub-divisional magistrate Mahesh Chandra Dikshit told media personnel that the district administration intends to write to the forest department asking them to make arrangements to capture the monkeys and bring this menace under control.
