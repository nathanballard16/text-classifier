'Biased, prejudiced': US report on global religious freedom ahead of Pompeo's India visit triggers angry reaction

BJP said the report shows clear bias against the Narendra Modi government and the saffron party as the MEA questioned a foreign government's 'locus standi'.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday strongly rejected the US State Department's 2018 International Religious Freedom Report which alleged that mob attacks by violent extremist Hindu groups against minority communities, particularly Muslims, continued in India in 2018, amid rumours that victims had traded or killed cows for beef.

The Ministry of External Affairs also condemned the report that raised questions about the government's inability to curb violent attacks on the country's minority Muslims.

The BJP said that the report shows clear bias against the Narendra Modi government and the saffron party, asserting that its leaders had strongly deplored violence against minorities and weaker sections of society.

The report, released on June 21, alleged that some senior leaders of the BJP "made inflammatory speeches against minority communities".

"Mob attacks by violent extremist Hindu groups against minority communities, especially Muslims, continued throughout the year amid rumors that victims had traded or killed cows for beef," it added.

The report covers government policies violating religious belief and practices of groups, religious denominations and individuals, and US policies to promote religious freedom around the world.
