Five Home Guard officials have been arrested by Gautam Buddh Nagar Police in connection with the attendance scam. Three accused officials — Montu Kumar (32), Shailendra Kumar (30) and Satyaveer Yadav (38) — are non-salaried Platoon Commandants, while Satish Chandra (35) is Assistant District Commandant and Ram Narayan Chaurasia (40) is Divisional Commandant, Aligarh. Chaurasia is the mastermind of the alleged scam that he initiated since his appointment as District Home Guard Commandant in Gautam Buddh Nagar in 2017 till he got promoted and transferred in 2019, police said.

The arrests were made a day after two to three-year-old muster rolls (attendance logs) were found burnt — in an apparent attempt to destroy evidence — inside the Gautam Buddh Nagar district Home Guard commandant’s office in Greater Noida. The police suspect that the arrested officials were behind the arson.

The scam came to light when a platoon commander had approached Gautam Buddh Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna in July claiming that some Home Guard officials allegedly withdrew salary on behalf of scores of force’s personnel by cooking up attendance figures.

The SSP said the irregularities appeared to have existed before 2017 also but it became prominent in the last two years.

“The arrested accused have told us that the scam has been going on for several years, and it appears that more than Rs 4 crore has been withdrawn in such a manner. The scam involved faking approval of police officials of the station concerned. If a Home Guard was absent, his name would also be entered and salary in his name would be withdrawn. The exact extent of the scam will be evaluated after further investigation,” said Krishna.

A forensic team from Gujarat inspected the Home Guard office in Surajpur after the burning of muster rolls. A special investigation team (SIT) led by Krishna and the SP (City) has been constituted to investigate the incident.

An FIR was lodged against Home Guard officials for fraud and forgery over the fraudulent withdrawal of salaries of the force’s personnel on November 13.

The FIR was lodged under IPC sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (fraud), 467, 468 and 471 (all three related to forgery of documents).

Part of the auxiliary force, Home Guards are not permanent employees and are recruited on a casual basis. They do not have any fixed monthly salary and are paid based on the number of days of duty. Around 700 Home Guards are presently deployed in Gautam Buddh Nagar, the police said.
