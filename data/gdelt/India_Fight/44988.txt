How To Mediate With A Neighbour That Uses Terrorism As Large Scale Industry: EAM S Jaishankar

"Before August 5 (Abrogation of Article 370), Kashmir was in a mess, difficulties in Kashmir did not start on August 5, it is supposed to be a way of dealing with those difficulties," EAM added.

India on Wednesday reiterated its stand on mediation with Pakistan and urged Islamabad to take corrective steps to tackle the menace of terrorism perpetrating in its borders. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) programme in New York on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, "You have terrorism in different parts of world but there is no part of world where a country uses it consciously and deliberately as a large scale industry against its neighbor." When asked about whether India wants to have a dialogue with Pakistan on issues of dispute, Jaishankar said, "Issue is not whether to talk or not, everybody wants to talk to their neighbor. Issue is how do I talk to a country that is conducting terrorism & follows a policy of implausible deniability." Further speaking upon the hotbed issue of Kashmir and abrogation of Article 370 in the state, Jaishankar said the level of intimidation had reached a height where senior police officers were lynched on streets of Srinagar, journalists who wrote against separatism were assassinated, military personnel returning home for Eid were kidnapped and killed.
