Kolkata: BJP leader and Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Babul Supriyo on Tuesday alleged that Rohingyas were involved in the killing of BJP workers of Sandeshkhali in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district.

The BJP leader further lashed out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of instigating violence in the state.

He further said that the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government would not last till 2021.

"(The) Chief Minister herself is provoking violence in the state and employing party workers and police for it. Also, it is a shocking revelation that the accused has links with Rohingyas. This government has no moral right to be in power," he told news agency ANI.

“The head of Bengali community is down with shame not only in India but across the world just because of the present scenario in West Bengal," said Supriyo.

On Saturday, a major clash had erupted between Trinamool Congress and BJP workers in Sandeshkhali over the forcible removal of Bharatiya Janata Party's flags in the area. Three people were killed in the violence.

The West Bengal BJP leadership is seeking a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the incident.

Earlier on Tuesday, BJP leader Mukul Roy had written a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, urging him to take immediate and appropriate action to save the lives of West Bengal people as "anarchy and chaos" prevails in the state because of violence.

On June 9, the Trinamool Congress had written a letter to the Home Minister over violence in the state.
