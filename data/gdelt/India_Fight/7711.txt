Security forces are working on new safeguards for the movement of convoys in Kashmir in wake of the recent attack on a CRPF convoy that killed 40 jawans as the threat of vehicle-borne suicide bombers has become a reality.

Officials said, new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that can tackle the new modus operandi adopted by terrorists, will soon be put in place.

While new measures to detect Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are being discussed, ways to segregate military movement from civil traffic are also being reviewed.

"We are discussing the option of stopping traffic for short intervals during the movement of convoys. More barricading will also be done to ensure vehicles cannot get close to the convoys," said a CRPF official.

Ahead of the February 14 attack, intelligence inputs about the possibility of a car suicide bomber had alarmed security forces, prompting high level meetings to combat the threat but no viable solutions could be reached at, security officials told India Today TV.

"Based on some inputs, ways to combat car bombs were discussed in the forces, including CRPF," said a source.

Adil Ahmad Dar, a youth from Pulwama in South Kashmir rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a bus carrying troops of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), killing 40 men on February 14.

The suicide bomber was a fresh recruit of the Jaish-e-Mohammed who was chosen to use the rare and new modus operandi to execute a fidayeen attack.

While stopping of civilian traffic during movement of convoys remains the only option now, sources said this will be tried initially as an experiment to assess whether it can be smoothly implemented without impacting daily lives of civilians.
