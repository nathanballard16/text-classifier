Amit Shah Shifts To Ex-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bungalow

The house-warming ceremony of Amit Shah's new home took place on August 15.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday moved into former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's bungalow at Krishna Menon Marg in central Delhi. He was earlier staying at a bungalow in Akbar Road.

The Home Minister was allotted Vajpayee's bungalow after the BJP came back into power for a second successive term.

The Krishna Menon Marg bungalow, home to the former prime minister and iconic BJP leader for 14 years, had been vacant since his death last year.

When Mr Vajpayee moved into the bungalow in 2004, after the BJP lost the election to the Congress-led UPA, he reportedly had its number changed from 8 to 6A.
