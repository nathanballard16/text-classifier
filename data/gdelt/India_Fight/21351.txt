Bribe case: CA, tax official arrested

JALANDHAR: Harmeet Singh, Hoshiarpur-based assistant commissioner, sales tax (GST) mobile wing, and Tanda-based chartered accountant Raman Sondhi were arrested on Friday by the Punjab vigilance bureau while accepting a bribe of Rs 2 lakh from the owner of a marriage hall.According to the vigilance bureau, Sondhi is chartered accountant for Tanda-based Tara Singh, the owner of White House Resort marriage palace, but was working as a conduit for the accused assistant commissioner. Tara Singh complained to the vigilance bureau that the GST department team, headed by assistant commissioner Harmeet Singh, raided his marriage palace on February 28 this year and after inspecting the records, seized some of his account books.Harmeet called Tara Singh and his CA Raman Sondhi to his office in Hoshiarpur on April 1, vigilance bureau SSP Diljinder Singh Dhillon revealed. "When Tara Singh and his CA met the official in the latter's office, he told them they had not filed GST returns for 11 months and could face penalty of Rs 1 crore. Baffled marriage palace owner pleaded that he simply would not be able to pay such a heavy amount as his business was not as profitable as expected. The officer scaled down the penalty to Rs 50 lakh and finally settled for Rs 20 lakh, stating that Rs 8 lakh had to be deposited as GST in the department's bank account, Rs 5 lakh would be the penalty and Rs 7 lakh would be his bribe," SSP Dhillon said.
