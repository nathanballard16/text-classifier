Lethpora (Pulwama), Feb 14

The local militant, Adil Dar (21), who rammed his car into the CRPF convoy had joined the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in April last year, police sources said.

Dar is the second Kashmiri militant to have been involved in a suicide bomb attack on troops. In 2000, a JeM militant from Srinagar, Aafaq Shah, had blown up an explosive-laden vehicle outside the Army’s 15 Corps headquarters.

A JeM spokesperson later claimed responsibility for Thursday’s attack and identifed the suicide bomber as Adil Ahmad, alias Waqas Commando, of Pulwama. Before the attack, the militant recorded a video statement, which was later released on the social media.

Police sources said Dar, a Class X passout, was listed as a ‘category C’ militant. “He used to work as a band saw machine operator before joining militancy,” a police officer said. Dar’s family claimed he had left home last year.

“We have had no contact with him ever since,” said Aarif, his younger brother.

Jaish has been declared a terrorist organisation by the UN Security Council.

However, the India-led proposal to put a ban on Jaish supremo Masood Azhar continues to be blocked by veto-wielding China. Sources say a fresh attempt at moving the proposal is unlikely. — TNS

Explosion was heard 10 km away

The explosive used in the attack was so strong that the blast was heard 10-12 km away, locals said. Some of the bodies were so badly blown up that officials feel it may take some time to identity them. This was the first suicide car bomb strike in Kashmir since the 2001 attack on the Assembly that left 41 persons, including three suicide attackers, dead.
