CBI raids premises of AIADMK MP Anwar Raajhaa’s in Tamil Nadu

Chennai: The CBI on Friday conducted raids at premises of Tamil Nadu Waqf Board chairman and AIADMK MP Anwar Raajhaa in Chennai and Ramanathapuram in connection with an alleged recruitment scam, officials said.

Besides Raajhaa, the CBI also carried out searches on the premises of the then secretary and correspondent of MSS Waqf Board College Jamal Mohideen in Madurai.

“The searches were carried out as there were allegations that the Board hired assistant lecturers who were not having requisite qualifications as per the University Grants Commission against payment of illegal gratification of Rs 30-35 lakh,” the CBI said.

The agency has registered FIRs against Raajhaa and Mohideen.
