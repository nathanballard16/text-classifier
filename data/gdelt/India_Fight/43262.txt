A close source to Takht reveals, “The film will be extensively shot in Italy. The picturesque castles and old architecture of the country speak history, and KJo wants to capture the elegance. To make it further look like the Mughal era, he also plans to use VFX. They’re planning to execute the shoot on a grand scale in Italy,” reports Bollywood Hungama.

Apart from Italy, the rest of the shoot will take place in Mumbai, on the huge sets.

Karan Johar who is often criticized for only focussing on beautiful, high-class people with perfect lives in his works, said that he won’t apologize for films that he has made, although he is willing to change his cinematic syntax with changing times.
