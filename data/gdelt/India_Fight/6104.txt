Rohtak, February 14

A day after a Rohtak couple, Ashok Jain and Sonia, was found murdered in their house at Ram Nagar Naya Padao locality here, the CIA-1 wing of the district police today arrested Ashok’s brother Anand.

The hunt has been launched to arrest Anand’s brother-in-law, Rahul, who is also a suspect.

A dispute over their ancestral property was the reason behind the murder, the police have said.

Ashok had six siblings — a brother and five sisters. Ashok was staying in the Ashok’s parental house here, while Anand lived in New Delhi.

“It was decided among the siblings that Ashok will retain the parental house and will give Rs10 lakh to his brother in lieu of that. He gave Rs1.5 lakh and promised to pay the balance amount in instalments, but he did not keep his word. Nursing a grudge against Ashok, Anand planned to kill him,” Rohtak ASP Maqsood Ahmed told the media.

The police said Anand and Rahul reached Ashok’s house around 11 pm on Tuesday and told the couple that they would stay for the night. They got up early the next morning.

“When Sonia went to serve them tea, Anand and Rahul stabbed her to death. Hearing the noise, Ashok got up. The two also stabbed him to death,” the police said.

Ashok had married Sonia, who belonged to another caste, about seven years ago against the wishes of their families.

“A murder case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by Anand, who eventually turned out to be the killer,” the ASP said.
