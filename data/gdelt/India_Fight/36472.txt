Life of a doctor

A doctor’s life is always on edge (Open Page, “All in a day’s work for this doctor”, July 28). Ultimately he is judged, hailed or condemned, based on the end result, ignoring all the sincere efforts and dedication invested by the doctor when handling a case. The primary reason for this is the assumption that a doctor is an omnipotent saviour.

This misconception needs to be erased from our minds. Even after the best treatment, a patient may not survive due to extraneous factors. A doctor is also a normal being just doing his job. He can only do it with all the wisdom, knowledge, sincerity and dedication at his command.

The article was extremely poignant, conveying the anguish of not being able to save a patient. Doctors wage a relentless battle day in and day out to save patients under their care but at times fate decides otherwise.
