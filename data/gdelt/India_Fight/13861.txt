Police make public two Indian nationals involved in abduction of Nepali businessman Suresh Kedia

PARSA, March 9: Police on Saturday made public two Indian nationals who were the mastermind behind the abduction of Nepali businessman Suresh Kedia.

Amid a press conference, Parsa District Police Office made public Indian nationals Bablu Paswan and driver Bijaya Kumar Mahato who masterminded the kidnap of Nepali businessman Kedia from Bariyarpur of Bara district in May 2016. Pawan and Yadav are from the Indian state of Bihar.

Police Inspector Rewati Dhakal told Republica Online that the duo were arrested from Chhiparmai Rural Municipality in Parsa, on Friday morning.

"We nabbed them during a raid at Chhiparmai Rural Municipality following a tip-off," Dhakal said.

Paswan, who is under the police custody, has admitted that he masterminded the kidnap of businessman Kedia.

A case has already been filed against the duo on the charge of abduction, organized crime and among others. "We will soon handover them to Bara Police," Dhakal said.

On May 29, 2019, Indian police rescued businessman Suresh Kedia from Motihari in Bihar state of India and handed him over to his family in Birgunj. The victim is a member of the renowned Kedia Group of Birgunj.



After learning that a special team of Indian police was deployed to free industrialist Kedia, the kidnappers had left him on a highway near Motihari. Kedia himself had come into contact with the police. Kedia informed that he was brought in a motorbike and left there.



A group of unidentified assailants had kidnapped businessman Suresh Kedia from Bariyarpur of Bara district, after shooting and injuring his chauffer. The kidnappers, who used a Scorpio jeep with an Indian registration number, attacked the driver all of a sudden and kidnapped Kedia.

They first had opened fire at the driver, Shyam Umesh Prasad Sah, who is from Bindawabasini, Birgunj Sub-metropolis-22. He had sustained serious bullet injuries.
