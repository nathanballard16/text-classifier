MP court orders seizure of assets worth Rs 17.60 lakh of teacher

Indore, Jan 24 (PTI) A court here Thursday ordered the seizure of assets worth Rs 17.60 lakh of a school headmaster in Madhya Pradesh.

Special Judge S S Kushwaha observed that the headmaster, Ramdayal Joshi, had amassed the assets through corrupt means and thus, those should be impounded.
