Rogue Students Beat Up a Shop-owner; Riot Ensues

Patna: Following the beating of a shop-owner in Bhikhna Pahari under Kadam Kuan police station on Thursday night, residents in the area blocked the road on Friday morning and pelted stones at the notorious Patel Chhatrawas leading to a violent clash between the students and the local residents.

As reported, some students living in the Patel Chhatrawas beat up the owner of a 'lassi' shop who was identified as Bittu. The miscreants also hit Bittu on his head with glasses and bottles causing injury to him. When a relative of Bittu tried to intervene, he was also roughed up by the lodge residents.

Accusing the students of terrorizing small business-owners, the protestors on Friday morning demanded arrests of those who beat up Bittu the night before. As the crowd gathered outside the lodge, someone lobbed a crude bomb causing a panic in the area. Though no one was injured in the incident, a police vehicle was hit by a flying shrapnel making a small dent.

To keep the incident from further escalating, authorities summoned anti-riot gears including the Vajra vehicle as shops downed their shutters to avoid being the target of arsonists or vandals.

After much efforts, the situation was finally brought under control. Authorities carried out raids in the student lodge but guilty students had already vacated their rooms and had gone underground.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manu Maharaj said police was gathering surveillance footages from the area to identify the miscreants.
