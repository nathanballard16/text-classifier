UoH students to hold Vemula’s death anniversary

Students of University of Hyderabad would hold the third death anniversary of research scholar Rohith Vemula on Thursday. Mr. Vemula had killed himself in a hostel room at the university on January 17, 2016, triggering protests across the country.

On Thursday, the deceased student’s mother Radhika Vemula and the mother of Najeeb Ahmed, a JNU student who went missing in 2017, would attend the commemoration at UoH. The event would also have the presence of Perumalla Balaswamy, father of Pranay Perumalla, a Dalit Christian who was murdered by his upper-caste wife’s family. Madari Raju and Pulyala Ravi, who are brothers of two Dalit students who committed suicide – Madari Venkatesh and Pulyala Raju respectively – will also be present at the event which would commence at 3 p.m.

The university has been witnessing protests ever since the administration removed a temporary shack named Velivada or Dalit Ghetto where Rohith Vemula had spent his last days.
