AFSPA needs to be reviewed to make it more humane: Lt Gen Hooda

NEW DELHI: The Armed Forces Special Powers Act ( AFSPA ) needs to be reviewed to make it more humane as well as accord better protection to soldiers deployed in counter-militancy operations, says Lt-General DS Hooda (retd), who oversaw the crossborder " surgical strikes " as the Northern Army Command chief in September 2016."There are, in fact, shortfalls in the AFSPA in protecting our soldiers, especially after the Supreme Court judgment of July 2016 (which basically held military personnel could not escape investigation for excesses during discharge of duty even in disturbed areas). A review is needed, not dilution or removal," said Lt-Gen Hooda, speaking to TOI on Thursday.This comes amidst BJP's blistering attack on Congress for promising in its manifesto to review the AFSPA as well as the deployment of armed forces in Jammu and Kashmir . "Suitable changes will be made in the text of the law (AFSPA) to balance the requirements of security and the protection of human rights," said the Congress manifesto.Lt-Gen Hooda also said the national security strategy (NSS) vision document he prepared for the Congress, after consultations with experts in fields ranging from foreign affairs and energy security to police and intelligence, does not talk about either the AFSPA or the number of troops required to combat insurgency in J&K."There is no reference to AFSPA or troop deployment, one way or the other, because these are tactical issues. The NSS document instead is a long-term vision paper about what the country's national security should be in the years ahead," he said."I have made a broad recommendation that our political objectives in J&K must first be clear, and then the military can draw its strategy from them. We need a combined politico-military strategy. It's wrong to equate a political manifesto with a NSS," he added.The over 40-page NSS paper takes "a holistic look" at India's national security challenges in five parts. They are India's rightful place in global affairs, securing the country's neighbourhood, resolving internal conflicts, protecting citizens from risks and building requisite capabilities in the military, police, cyber, space, border management and other domains, as earlier reported by TOI.Lt-Gen Hooda's NSS report was not reflected in the Congress manifesto because it was presented to party president Rahul Gandhi just two days before the manifesto was released on April 2. "This exhaustive (NSS) report will first be discussed and debated within the Congress party," said Gandhi.
