EXCLUSIVE: Chandragupta Maurya fame Parth Tiwari REACTS to being attacked by 50 goons: I was in jail for a day

Chandragupta Maurya actor Parth Tiwari recently made news after it was reported that the actor was attacked by around 50 goons near his locality. The actor posted the details of the incident on his social media page. When we got in touch with Parth, he replied that he was in jail for a day and was allowed to leave on bail on December 5. He said, "I didn't even know how it all started. I was just going to my floor when I accidentally brushed my shoulder with another man who started yelling. We had an argument there and he called up more people."

Parth continued, "I called up police helpline number 100, but no one picked up. I had an idea that he was planning to get me beaten up. Around 20-30 men came and they started to hit me. Even I hit them back but obviously, they were huge in number. Later, I did share the incident and filed a case at the police station wherein they were called. Even they filed a case against me for hitting them and hence along with them even I was jailed."

"I have no complaints with the police. They were just doing their job, but yes, I have a huge problem with their helpline number not working. I don't have too many friends in the industry or in Mumbai, who do I call for help? If the police are not there to help, where do people like me find help?" Parth added.

He concluded that the only reason he shared the news is that he doesn't want such incidents to happen again.
