Approach HCs: SC to petitioners on police action in Jamia, AMU

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked petitioners seeking an inquiry into alleged police excesses against Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University students agitating against the Citizenship Amendment Act to move the high courts concerned after solicitor general Tushar Mehta said AMU had called in police and no student was arrested yet by Delhi Police A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said all the petitions pertained to law and order situations and police action, which could relate to different actions and circumstances."We are not the institution which has power to control law and order. We are not saying that it is not a problem or that it is not serious. What we are saying is you all must go before high courts concerned, which would be better equipped to appreciate your grievances and take remedial measures," the bench said.CJI Bobde said chief justices of high courts were competent to decide setting up of committees headed by retired Supreme Court or HC judges for a fact-finding exercise and inquiry into alleged excesses committed by police against protesting students after hearing the Centre and state governments, as the case may be.When senior advocates Mehmood Pracha and Colin Gonsalves made an impassioned appeal for the court to send a retired Supreme Court judge to AMU to inquire into "brutal force used by police" and said this would pacify agitated students, Mehta said, "Police officers are present in the court with all documents. It will satisfy the court's judicial conscience that no excessive force was used. The police was called into AMU by its registrar Abdul Hamid. In Delhi, police allowed students to go from hospital after a Jamia official identified them."Delhi Police claimed it went inside Jamia after it received calls from hostellers that they were stuck inside their rooms.Mehta said Delhi Police had video evidence of students burning 14 DTC and cluster buses, 20 private cars and two-wheelers.
