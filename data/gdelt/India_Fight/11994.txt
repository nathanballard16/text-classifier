Pakistan proposes Noble Peace Prize for Imran Khan

Pakistan information min’s resolution states decision to release Indian pilot makes Pak PM ‘Nobel-worthy’.

Islamabad: Pakistan Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Saturday submitted a resolution in National Assembly Secretariat, demanding to award a Nobel Peace Prize to Prime Minister Imran Khan for wisely handling the soaring Pakistan-India tensions.

The resolution stated that the premier’s decision of releasing arrested Indian Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman had de-escalated the hostility between both the countries. It added that Indian aggression towards Pakistan had risked lives of several people.

Imran Khan had responsibly acted in the current situation for which he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, the resolution demanded. The step came day after Pakistan handed over captured Indian pilot to Indian authorities at Wagah border in a “peace gesture”.

Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG-21 jet was shot down over Kashmir on Wednesday, after a dogfight in the skies over the disputed Himalayan region which sent tensions between Pakistan and India to their highest levels in years and alarmed world powers, who issued calls for restraint.

Finance minister Qureshi, meanwhile, announced he was boycotting a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held in Abu Dhabi, as India had been invited.

The latest confrontation between the neighbours erupted after a suicide bombing in Kashmir killed over 40 Indian troops on February 14.

Twelve days later Indian warplanes crossed into Pakistan and dropped payload. It was the first such aerial raid since their last war in 1971 - before either country had nuclear weapons.

Pakistan denied casualties or damage in the incident and shot down Indian jets, capturing its pilot.

Prime Minister Imran Khan unexpectedly announced that Abhinandan Varthaman would be released a day later in the first sign of a potential thaw.
