Puri picks Varanasi for 'action'

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's massive road show and political campaigning, a Telugu film will be shot in the 'holy' city.

Shooting of 'iSmart Shankar' will resume in the temple city from Wednesday. A high octane action episode will be canned, aver

makers.

This action episode comes at a crucial juncture in the film and so the director Puri Jagannadh is going to shoot it on a large canvas. For this, the makers booked a whole flight for the entire cast and crew.

Real Satish will choreograph this action episode in trademark Puri Jagannadh style. Starring Ram Pothineni, Nidhhi Agerwal and Nabha Natesh in the lead roles, the film comes up with caption 'Double Dimaark Hyderabad.'

Mani Sharma is composing music for the film which is touted to be an action entertainer. Puri and Charmme Kaur are producing 'iSmart Shankar' under Puri Jagannadh Touring Talkies and Puri Connects banner. It's slated for summer release.
