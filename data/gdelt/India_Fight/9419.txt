Stray bullets

A final-year MBBS student, Nimrah Baig, died last Friday (February 22) after getting hit by a stray bullet. The Sindh government must investigate the matter thoroughly. People who are responsible for the death of the young girl should be put behind the bars.

The law-enforcement agencies should also play their part in improving the security of the country’s largest city. Gun laws should be modified and the police should avoid engaging in encounters in vibrant public spaces (last year, a 10-year-old lost her life after being shot at by a stray bullet).
