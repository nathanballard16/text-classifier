GUJCET 2019 exam date changed due to general elections

GUJCET 2019 will examine the candidates and shortlist them for admission to engineering, degree and diploma pharmacy courses.

The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) is expected to reschedule the exam dates for the Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GUJCET 2019). The board will reschedule the GUJCET 2019 exam dates due to the clash of exam schedule with the date of general elections in the state. The Gujarat board will declare the revised schedule soon on its official website- gujcet.gseb.org.

Previous changes in exam schedule:

Earlier, the board changed the dates of the exam to be conducted on March 28 and on April 4, 2019 twice due to CBSE Board Exam 2019 dates.

Now, this is going to be the third time for the boards to change date of an exam to be conducted on April 23, 2019.
