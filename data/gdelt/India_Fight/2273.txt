During the ceremony, an unknown person allegedly fired a bullet which brushed the leg of the bride. She was subsequently rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.

As of now, police authorities are trying to track down the culprit and determine whether the shot was accidentally fired or with an intention to cause harm.

Narrating the incident, the bridegroom said nobody could identify the person who shot the bullet which brushed past the leg of the bride. "Don't know who the person was. Bullet brushed past her legs. Police was later called here, he said.

While police came to the spot after being informed about the incident, people present at the wedding said the perpetrator may have fled when the bride was being taken to the hospital.

The shot was fired when the bridegroom was approaching the bride on the stage, following which the woman collapsed immediately. While the atmosphere became dull after the bride was shot, the brave woman decided to return and complete the wedding ceremony.
