In a shocking turn of events, two of the extras from Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff's forthcoming action film were allegedly booked by the Mumbai Police in Palghar area suspecting they were terrorists. According to a report in TV9 Gujurat, the two men, dressed in bomber-like vest were seen strolling around Vasai area to buy cigarretes is when an onlooker happened to inform the cops. The police was quick enough to reach the spot and catch hold of them, before realising that they are actually artists shooting for a film and not terrorists.

The two men were released only after the film’s production unit produced official papers proving their identity. They have been recognised as Balram Ginwala (23) and Arbaaz Khan (20). However, having said that, the two have been still booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for creating panic in public.

We wonder if Hrithik or Tiger will react to this news or stay mum. Directed by Siddharth Anand, this film in question also stars Vaani Kapoor. Stay tuned to this space for more updates on this story.
