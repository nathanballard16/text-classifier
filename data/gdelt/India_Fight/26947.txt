Opinion : This is Modi’s India now

There are those like psephologist-turned-politician Yogendra Yadav, who told me in an interview that the “Congress must die” for a new political opposition to rise against Modi. He needn’t fret; the party already appears to be in a state of terminal decline. The Congress lost 174 of the 188 seats where it faced the BJP head to head. The party that once stood for the values of India’s independence movement today depends on the leadership of just one political family. No wonder, then, that Modi can repeatedly point to his self-made rise from a tea vendor’s son to prime minister as a powerful contrast to his challengers.
