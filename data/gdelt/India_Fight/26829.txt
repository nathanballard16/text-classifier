West Bengal saw the fiercest of the electioneering in the Lok Sabha polls with the Tirnamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fighting in every nook and cranny of the state that sends 42 MPs to the Lok Sabha. And, on the day of counting of votes, the BJP seems to be the happier party in the latest trend.

The BJP was in the lead on 22 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal while the TMC was leading in 17 parliamentary constituencies. If this trend continues, the TMC is in for shock at the end of the counting of votes for the Lok Sabha election in Bengal, which will go to the assembly polls in 2021.
