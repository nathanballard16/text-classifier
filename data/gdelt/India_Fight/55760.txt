Students read the preamble of the Constitution at India Gate, New Delhi, on Monday.

Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Protests: Fresh protests erupted outside Jamia Millia Islamia metro station on Monday, a day after the police crackdown on the university students. People were heard shouting slogans against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and also set effigies afire. This comes as students from IIT Bombay, IIM Ahmedabad, IISc Bangalore, Mumbai University, Delhi University and other deemed institutions stood in support of the students of Jamia who were assaulted by police while they were protesting against the amended Citizenship Act yesterday.

Authorities at Jamia Millia Islamia University on Monday termed Sunday’s police crackdown against its students as a “war-like situation” and demanded a high-level probe into the incident. The Federation of Central Universities’ Teachers’ Associations (FEDCUTA) also demanded a judicial enquiry into the matter to be done by a sitting judge.

As many as 50 students, who were detained during protests at the Jamia Millia Islamia University against the contentious law in the national capital, were released in the wee hours of Monday. While 35 of them were released were the Kalkaji police station, the remaining 15 were released from New Friends Colony. Over 100 people, including students, policemen and firefighters were injured, after cops lobbed teargas shells inside the college campus, forced their way in, and allegedly dragged students out of the library and the mosque, and assaulted them. Meanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called for a mega rally in Kolkata to protest against the citizenship law.
