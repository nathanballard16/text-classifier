Jr NTR turns down Big Boss!

Looks like fans of Telugu reality show Bigg Boss are in for a major disappointment. Apparently, Jr NTR, who hosted Season 1 of the reality show, has backed out of hosting Season 3 due to a clash of dates.

While Jr NTR successfully hosted Season 1, Season 2 was hosted by Nani. However, the makers were keen to rope in the former for Season 3 to recreate the magic and had even approached him for the same. The Jai Lava Kusa star however, declined the offer since the dates of his current film RRR, directed by Rajamouli were clashing with that of Bigg Boss.

A source close to the makers of the reality show informs, “Although the makers were game to pay a huge remuneration to Jr NTR, the actor did not take it up. He was honest enough to admit that the dates of his film would clash. They are now scouting for a replacement for the show, which is expected to start in July later this year.”

Meanwhile, the actor is all geared up to shoot for his next schedule of RRR in Pune and Ahmedabad. He would be seen in the role of Komaram Bheem in the multi-starrer, which also has Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn.
