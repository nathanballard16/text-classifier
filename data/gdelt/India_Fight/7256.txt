From Buffalo to Nanjing: GI’s radio skills took him to occupied China

His son, Neil Lange, agreed.

“It probably was part of the peace process. The Japanese are there. They are not shooting at the planes, and then the Chinese surround this place. And suddenly it’s a radio station,” said Neil Lange.

“We had won the European front already, but the Japanese were expanding to all the islands and taking them over. Very soon after that the war ended.”

Lange lived in Kaisertown and graduated from Buffalo Technical High School in 1938. He was 21 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve to attend classes in military procedure at the University of Buffalo. He was restricted to “limited service” because of asthma and poor eyesight, he said.

In the Army, Lange was transported to Oran, Algeria, “zigzagging” across the Mediterranean Sea on a Liberty ship to avoid enemy submarines, he recalled.

From Algeria, a British transport ship took him through the Suez Canal to Bombay, India, where he caught a cattle car to Calcutta. In Burma (now called Myanmar), Lange and other members of the 998 Signal Service Battalion provided radio support for combat tanks.
