Drug regulator cracks whip on 45 units illegally making med devices

NEW DELHI: The drug regulator has raided as many as 45 medical device facilities across the country for illegally manufacturing orthopaedic implants without a regulatory license or approval, cracking the whip on companies making high-end life saving devices without following best practices and quality standards.The facilities are based in Delhi, UP, Maharashtra and Gujarat, official sources said. "We are issuing show cause notices to these facilities and the owner firm asking them to explain the reason for the violation. Once we get their responses, action will be taken under provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act," a senior official told TOI.During the surprise inspections, carried out by 37 inspection teams with 125 officers from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation on Monday, drug inspectors observed "dirty and filthy conditions" for manufacturing, lack of quality management and testing facilities as well as substandard raw material.Of the four states, Delhi accounted for the maximum number of unapproved facilities with the central regulatory teams conducting raids at 25 factories, whereas eight facilities were inspected in Maharashtra and six each in Gujarat and UP.The move assumes significance because medical devices is a rapidly growing segment in India, particularly for high- end implants like cardiac and orthopaedic implants where medical procedures are increasing swiftly despite the high prices of these devices and overall treatment. Currently, the industry in India is pegged at $7 billion and is projected to reach $50 billion by 2025.
