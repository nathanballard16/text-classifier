Fresh landslides shut Manali-Leh highway

Fresh landslides struck Himachal Pradesh’s Kullu district on Wednesday, blocking traffic on one of the major highways in the State, while the Yamuna continued to flow over the danger mark in Delhi, officials said.

In Uttarakhand, a helicopter engaged in relief-and-rescue operations in rain-ravaged Uttarkashi district crashed, killing all three persons on board.

The water in the Yamuna river started receding in the national capital, but the river was still flowing above the danger mark.

According to the Flood Control Room, the water level came down to 206.50 metres at 5 pm from 206.60 metres at 2 pm on Wednesday. “The water level is likely to recede further as Haryana has so far not released water from the Hathni Kund barrage in large quantity,” a government official said, adding that at 4 pm, only 10,000 cusecs had been released.

The river breached the danger mark of 205.33 metres on Monday. Due to inundation of the low-lying areas, over 15,000 people living in the Yamuna floodplains were shifted to the tents set up by various government agencies, officials said.

More landslides in HP

A helicopter engaged in relief-and-rescue operations in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi district crashed, killing all three persons on board. The helicopter, belonging to Heritage Aviation, crashed near Moldi after getting entangled in power cables, Ashok Kumar, Uttarakhand’s Director-General of Police (Law and order), said. The pilot, the co-pilot and a local were killed in the crash, he added.

Army helicopters were pressed into service to air drop food packets in villages in Punjab’s Jalandhar district as they remained inundated because of breaches in the earthen embankments of the Sutlej river.

Following the recent rains and release of excess water from the Bhakra dam, the Sutlej and its tributaries had flooded villages in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Ferozepur and Rupnagar, damaging crops and houses.
