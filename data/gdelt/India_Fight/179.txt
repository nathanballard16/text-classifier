Delhi: Police arrest former JD(U) MLA who allegedly shot woman in the head during New Year’s party

The police on Wednesday arrested a former two-time MLA from Bihar for allegedly shooting a 45-year-old woman in the head at a New Year’s party in a farmhouse in New Delhi, ANI reported. Raju Kumar Singh, a politician with multiple cases against him, had fled along with his driver after the incident on Monday.

Singh was arrested from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, The Indian Express reported. The Delhi Police also recovered two rifles, a pistol and 800 live cartridges from the farmhouse, which is owned by Singh’s mother.

Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) RP Upadhyay had earlier said that a first information report was registered against the MLA for attempt to murder and destruction of evidence, based on a complaint filed by Vikas Gupta, the woman’s husband. The woman, identified as Archana Gupta, is in hospital in critical condition.

Vikas Gupta, in his complaint, alleged that Singh had fired two to three rounds around midnight. Following this, he saw his wife collapse, and realised that she was bleeding. Subsequently, Archana Gupta was brought to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj, where she is under treatment.

Singh was an MLA when he was in the Janata Dal (United) but had reportedly joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2015. Hailing from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Singh is an influential businessman, the police said. He has five other cases registered against him, including two under the Arms Act and another for attempt to murder, they said.
