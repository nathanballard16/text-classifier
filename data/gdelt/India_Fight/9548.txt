New Delhi: Hours after Indian Air force jets carried out massive strikes on terror camps deep inside Pakistan, a Pakistani drone was shot down by India near the international border in Kutch, Gujarat.

India’s alert air defence spotted the drone near the Naliya Air Base and shot it down. Naliya is one of India’s forward airbases, very close to the international border. As per reports, the drone was shot down at around 6:30 am.

The development came hours after Indian Air Force fighter jets cross the border with Pakistan and bombed multiple targets deep inside Pakistan. Mirage 2000s and Sukhois dropped laser-guided missiles at three locations – Muzaffarabad and Chikothi in PoK and Balakote in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
