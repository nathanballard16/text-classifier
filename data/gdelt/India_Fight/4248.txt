We wish Srishty a speedy recovery. She has been discharged from the hospital.

Meanwhile, Srishty was recently in news for her breakup with Manish Naagdev. The couple got engaged in February 2018, and had been dating for four years before they called it a quits. While Srishty hasn't opened up on the breakup, Manish in an interview said that compatibility issues is the reason behind their breakup. It was speculated that Srishty's rumoured linkup with Bigg Boss 12 co-contestant Rohit Suchanti was one of the reasons for their split. However, Manish refuted the rumours saying that the two did not split because of a third person.

“Srishty and I are not together anymore. I don’t wish to give a reason because there is none in particular. All I can say is, minor disagreements and difference of opinion led to it. We were expecting different things from each other. Around three weeks ago, we realised that things were not working out as expected. So, we discussed the future of our relationship and decided that it was better to part ways. I have immense love and respect for Srishty and I will always cherish the time spent with her," Manish said.
