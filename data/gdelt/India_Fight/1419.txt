Rajini mania grips Tamil Nadu as 'Petta' hits screen

Superstar Rajinikanth's 'Petta' got off to a roaring start across Tamil Nadu with his fans celebrating by turning up to watch the first day, first show at early hours of Thursday while two couples tied the knot right outside the cinema halls in Chennai and Thanjavur.

As Rajinikanth's movie release is a kind of festival for his fans, a young couple – Anbarasu and Kamatchi, both ardent fans of the actor – solemnised their marriage at the Woodlands theatre premise in Chennai to coincide with the release of the film. The couple, family members and relatives watched the movie 'Petta' after a wedding feast was served at the theatre.

A video of the couple getting married went viral on social media. Moreover, a stage was decorated for the couple at the cinema house and food was distributed to those who arrived to watch the movie.

At Thanjavur, another couple – Jothiraman and Usha Rani – got married at Santhi Theatre in presence of relatives and fans.

In Chennai, the fans began their celebrations on late Wednesday evening and continued through the night. At Kasi theatre in the city, fans from Japan watched the movie with Rajini fans.

Unlike previous Rajinikanth's movies, Thursday witnessed the release of another popular actor Ajith Kumar's Viswasam in an equal number of screens across the state. Two fans of actor Ajith suffered stab injuries in a clash for seats at a cinema in Vellore district at 3 am. In another incident, a few Ajith Kumar fans were injured when a huge cut-out of their hero crashed at a cinema in Villupuram. The fans climbed the cut-out to perform milk 'abhishekam' when it collapsed.

Rajinikanth's Petta, directed by Karthik Subbaraj, and Ajith Kumar's Viswasam, directed by Siva, were vying for honours, with fans going all out to prove the superiority of their hero's film over the rival's.
