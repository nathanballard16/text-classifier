Attempt to identify tiger was made in Aug

Vadodara: The state forest department may have got conclusive evidence of the existence of a tiger in the forest of Sant Matro in Santrampur taluka only now, but it had tried to identify the feline in August last year too after claims by villagers.

The forest department was told about the presence of the tiger by villagers and some pugmarks were also found. Officials also made the plaster cast of a pugmark in August, but they could not conclude if this was of a tiger.

Sources said that the pugmarks of a sub-adult tiger and an adult leopard are similar, making it difficult to differentiate between the two. In wake of no other evidence, the search for the tiger was given up. The plaster cast has been preserved by the department.

Officials now believe that the tiger may have been staying in the area since the past few months. “The forests in the area are largely undisturbed. Only a few villagers move into the jungles. The tiger may have stayed here as it was not troubled,” said Mahisagar district forest officer R M Parmar.
