To date, the Hindi cinema, especially Bollywood, is almost obsessed with foreign locales and exotic places to shoot their stories in. But it had all started back in 1964 when Raj Kapoor decided to shoot his film Sangam in foreign locales including Switzerland, Paris and Venice. It was then that the trend picked on and the filmmakers and producers desired to shoot their stories away from India against the backdrop of exuberant international landscapes.

Perhaps that's why the title Sangam, translating to confluence, seems more apt than ever! The film led Bollywood to go global and well, it's a trend that has stayed on. From Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar to Imtiaz Ali and Zoya Akhtar to Ali Abbas Zafar - the filmmakers have always got the Indian audience travel far-off places with their shooting locales.

The romantic film was directed by Raj Kapoor, written by Inder Raj Anand and produced by Raj Kapoor with Mehboob Studio and Filmistan. The film starred Vyjanthimala, Rajendra Kumar, Raj Mehra, Nana Palsikar and Lali Pawar apart from Raj Kapoor.

Besides the fact that it will always be remembered as the first film to be shot abroad, the film also marked a significant milestone in Raj Kapoor's own filmography as it was his first colour film. The film had gone to become a blockbuster in that era and till date, it's referred to as a classic of the Indian cinema. The film's songs, too, were loved and listeners continue to sing them till date. To name a few, I Love You, Bol Radha Bol, Dost Dost Na Raha, Yeh Mera Prem Patra, Main Kya Karoon Ram and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega are the songs that have lived on. The film had also released in Turkey, Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Greece and Hungary among others and was also remade in Kannada and Telugu.
