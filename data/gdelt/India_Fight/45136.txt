ANI said police have registered a case and an investigation is underway.

Thursday’s shooting came days after a property dealer, who had contested the 2012 civic body’s elections as an Independent candidate, was shot dead in Dwarka on Tuesday evening.

Police had said the murder could be the fallout of a money dispute or a gang. The CCTV footage of the attack was widely shared on social media in which a man with his face covered is seen shooting at 52-year-old Narender alias Ninty as he got into his car.

Delhi Police on Thursday said they have arrested a 23-year-old man for Narender’s murder.
