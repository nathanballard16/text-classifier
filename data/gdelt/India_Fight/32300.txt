Hyderabad: Just a day after All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary G Chinna Reddy blamed former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao for the party's recent shortcomings in the country, Narasimha's grandson on Friday launched a blistering attack on the Congress party alleging that the party sidelined Rao and disrespected him in his last moments. He also demanded party president Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi to issue a public apology for Reddy's comments.

Rao's grandson, NV Subhash, said that after Congress' 1996 debacle, PV Narasimha Rao was sidelined due to many issues, which were not concerned with his government policies. He added that the Congress party thought that if anyone apart from Gandhi-Nehru family continued then they themselves will not be noticed and so Rao was sidelined.

NV Subhash, who is affiliated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), went on to add that all failures of Congress have been attributed to PV Narasimha Rao and his contributions have not been credited to him.

"I demand that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi should apologise, and come and pay their tributes to him," said NV Subhash in his rant against the Congress.

Earlier on Thursday, Chinna Reddy stoked a controversy when he laid blame on Narasimha Rao for Congress' declining popularity in the country. He said that Narasimha Rao allowed the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 which led the Muslims away from the Congress and it was one of the prime reasons why the Gandhi family subsequently sidelined him.
