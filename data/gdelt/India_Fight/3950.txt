Katrina Kaif who is all set to star in Bharat is currently busy shooting for the film. While several days back the photos and videos of actor Salman Khan shooting in Malta, Abu Dhabi and Delhi were making rounds on the social media, it's now Katrina Kaif who is completing her part. The actress was seen enjoying the lunch break with Sunil Grover and the entire cast and crew of Bharat. Dressed in a simple sari with a bindi on her forehead, Katrina's look won hearts.

The actress once again took it to her Instagram handle and shared a monochrome photo, once again donning a bindi and her curly hair look from the film. Now Katrina has posted a photo with the choreographer Vaibhavi Merchant. The two can be seen smiling as they pose for a beautiful photo.

However, while the photo is garnering a lot of limelight, the backdrop of it is making us more curious. With all those decorations, it' looks like the audience will get a glimpse of the wedding or certain festivities in the film as well, and with Katrina and Vaibhavi coming together, one can be sure that the song is going to be a treat.

While Katrina shared a post today, a couple of days back Atul Agnihotri, who is co-producing the film too took it on his social media handle and shared a behind the camera shot. In the photo, Ali Abbas Zafar can be seen briefing Vaibhavi and if you notice, Katrina can be seen in one of the camera screens.

Well, all the photos are definitely making us curious for Bharat.
