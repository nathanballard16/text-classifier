Kolkata, Dec 05: West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar was on Thursday had to wait outside the locked gate number 3 of the legislative assembly, which is used for VIP entry, during a scheduled visit.

"Why is the gate no 3 closed? Despite my prior intimation, the gate is closed. The Assembly being adjourned does not mean it is closed.

"The governor's gate being locked has put our democratic history to shame," Dhankhar told reporters.

According to Assembly norms, gate no 3 is designated for the governor's entry and exit.
