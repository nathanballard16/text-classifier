Mumbai: Head cook of hotel murdered at his Kandivali residence

The Samta Nagar police have registered a case of murder against an unknown accused who allegedly killed a 34-year-old head cook of a Malad based hotel inside his residence. The deceased identified as Rambahadur Chetri was found dead by the manager of the hotel when he tried to locate his whereabouts. So far no arrest has been made in the case and the police are looking out for the murderer who is at large.

According to the police, the complainant in the case is Sandeep Kasekar (42) who is the manager of Spring Fields Hotel situated in Borivali east and while lodging the complaint, he informed that Chetri was working as a head cook since four years and would work in shifts.

He was addicted to consuming tobacco and drinking alcohol on an almost daily basis and when he did not turn up for work a few days back, the hotel staff contacted him over the phone but there was no response.

Kasekar when enquired with another staff who stayed close to Chetri, was informed that while the staff was leaving for work, he saw that lights inside Chetri's residence were on and when he called him, Chetri said in panicked tone that someone was trying to strangulate him.

"Thinking that matter to be serious, Kasekar along with few other staff of the hotel reached Chetri's residence in Kandivali and the room was locked from inside. After breaking the door, they discovered the body lying in a pool of blood and a knife which was kept close to him. When Chetri was rushed at Shatabdi hospital, he was declared dead on arrival after which we have registered a case of murder," said a police officer.

Police have registered the case under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and further investigation is underway.
