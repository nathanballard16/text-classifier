Akbaruddin Owaisi Likely To Return To Hyderabad Coming Week

Hyderabad: AIMIM leader and Chandrayanagutta MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi, whose health recently worsened, is likely to return to Hyderabad on June 19, according to an Urdu daily.

Asaduddin Owaisi's younger brother is currently in London undergoing treatment. It may be recollected that in December 2018, Akbaruddin was admitted at the Owaisi Hospital and Research Centre after he complained of severe stomach ache. Doctors pointed out that he had not been keeping well since the attack on his life in 2011 in Barkas, when he was shot in the stomach and sustained several knife injuries.

After the attack he was operated upon twice. They had also mentioned that his intestines were badly affected though there was no threat to his life.

In a report published in a leading English daily earlier, Akbaruddin Owaisi had said that it was becoming difficult for him to contest elections as his health was in a delicate state. And this could also prevent him from contesting elections in the future.

Meanwhile, addressing party members during the Eid Milaap event at Darussalam, Asaduddin appealed supporters to pray for the well being of his brother.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy also wished for the speedy recovery for the leader's health.
