Four people who had been arrested after an illegal hoarding killed a 23-year-old techie earlier this month, have been released on bail.

The four accused Palani, Subramani, Sankar and Lakshmikant were employed by AIADMK functionary C Jayagopal to erect the banners on the Chennai roads.

AIADMK functionary C Jayagopal was booked by police and the Chennai corporation after 23-year-old software engineer Subashree was killed in Chennai earlier this month. The illegal hoarding fell on the techie, following which she was hit by a water tanker.

WHAT HAPPENED

The illegal hoarding was reportedly erected as part of wedding celebrations of the Jayagopal's son on the Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road.
