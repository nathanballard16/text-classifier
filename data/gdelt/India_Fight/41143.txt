SBI expects Q1FY20 GDP at 5.6% with a downward bias

"There is indeed evidence that economy is undergoing a slowdown. We believe the most crucial factor that is reinforcing is that rural wage growth (in real terms) is now barely expanding. Also, the weighted contribution of clothing (a non-discretionary item) in rural CPI has plunged from 39 bps in Jun’18 to almost zero in Jul’19. We also expect Q1FYGDP to be at 5.6 percent with a downward bias," Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser at SBI said.

He further said if we go beyond the macro picture interesting trends appear. "First, the auto sector slowdown in India is a part of the global crisis that is unfolding. Studies done in the sector show that Auto sales in Asia-Pacific are expected to fall 2-3.5 percent this year after declining roughly 1 percent in 2018. Second, it’s not all doom and gloom in the FMCG sector, where the volume growth decline of listed companies in Q1 FY20 in single digits is now being quoted universally to justify the abundance of growth slowdown," he explained.
