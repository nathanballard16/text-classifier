Party workers from the state's Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's Telegu Desam Party (TDP) clashed with their rivals from YSR Congress (YSRC) at Anantapur. Both parties lost a worker each.

YSRC alleged that the people from the state's governing party (TDP) had tried to rig the votes at a booth where polling was going on. It claimed that one of their deceased, Pulla Reddy, was attacked with sickles by rival party workers and murdered. It further alleged that one more worker belonging to their party was injured.

Countering the opposition's allegations, the state's Chief Minister Naidu, while condemning the killings, including that of his party worker Sidda Bhaskar Reddy, said that it was the YSRC that first resorted to violent means to win the election.

Looking to the developing situation, additional police forces were rushed to the polling station and the situation was brought under control.
