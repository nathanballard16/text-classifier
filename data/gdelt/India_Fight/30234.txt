2 militants killed in Awantipora gunfight

ANANTNAG, June 14: Two Lashkar-e-Toiba militants were killed in a gunfight with government forces in southern Pulwama district on Friday.

The slain militants were identified as Irfan Ahmad Diju of Naina Litter and Tasaduq Amin Shah of Kadlabal Pampore.

A joint contingent of counter insurgent forces had launched a siege to the Bandina village of police district Awantipora in the pre-dawn hours and began door to door searches following a credible intelligence input about the presence of militants.

At around 9 AM in the morning, official sources and locals said, forces came in contact with the militants who were hiding in a residential house.

Officials said the hiding militants fired upon the forces as soon as contact was established with them. The forces retaliated the fire leading to a gunfight.

Both the militants were killed after hours of firefight between the two sides.

Local sources said the residential house where the militants were sheltered was completely destroyed after the forces set it on fire during the encounter.

The bodies of both the slain were handed over to their families for last rites after medical and legal formalities.

Thousands of people later participated in the funeral prayers of the slain. Local sources said people mostly youth from nearby and far off areas reached the native places of the slain duo to attend their last rites. Both, they said, were buried amid pro-freedom and anti-India slogans after multiple funeral prayers.

Meanwhile, shutdown was observed Awantipora, Sangam, Naina and Pampore areas against the killing of militants. Authorities also snapped the internet services in Pulwama and Anantnag districts to maintain the order.
