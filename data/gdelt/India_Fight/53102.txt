According to the police, the four men had been drinking from the afternoon near the Tondepalli toll plaza. When they spotted the woman having trouble with her two wheeler, one of them, Mohammed Pasha alias Arif offered to help her while Naveen let the air out from one of the tyres at about 9.18 pm on Thursday night. They abducted her and along with the other two accomplices sexually assaulted her.
