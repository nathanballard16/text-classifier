Justice for Felani on hold

Eight years ago, the poor Felani Khatun, a 15-year-old girl, was crossing the Indian border to come back home to Kurigram. But a bullet from Indian Border Security Force (BSF) put a stop to her life. The girl's father, Nur Islam, who was accompanying her, had got on the other side of the border just a few minutes before. When she was on top of the barbed wire fence, she was shot. Her body kept hanging from the fence, and the photo of the scene created furore and raised a media outcry. A special court in India tried the accused, BSF jawan Amiya Ghosh, twice. Both times, he was acquitted. Here is a chronicle of the incidents involving the killing.
