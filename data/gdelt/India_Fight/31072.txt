SURAT THANI: A Slovakian man was arrested for illegally running a spa business on Koh Phangnan and for overstaying his visa during a police raid late on Thursday night.

A team of tourist police and immigration officials searched Gaia Nature Spa, owned by Tomas Krocka, a Slovakian national, in Koh Phangan district at around 10pm. They acted on an arrest warrant.
