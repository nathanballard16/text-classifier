KDMC official attacked by goons, undergoes 9 stictches on chest

Dombivli police are looking for assailants who attacked a Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) engineer on Friday evening. The engineer from the PWD department of KDMC was on his way home when he was attacked with sharp weapons by three to four people.

Around 6.05 pm on March 22, 55-year-old Subhash Patil was attacked on the skywalk near Dombivli east by four men. "Patil lives in Thane, and works in Dombivli. He was on the skywalk, walking towards the station to catch a train for Thane when, around three to four men, in a mask, attacked him," said police inspector L B Chavan from Ramnagar police station, Dombivli.

The accused are in their 30s and covered their faces with a handkerchief. Patil called his relative in Dombivli, who took him to Icon Hospital. The cops were also simultaneously informed.

"He has received eight to nine stitches on his chest and is still undergoing treatment," says Chavan. The cops have registered a case against the unknown assailants under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention). However, no arrests have been made yet.

"We have got no leads yet. Patil looks clueless about the motive of the attack. Even the CCTV near the skywalk could not capture the attackers," he said.

The KDMC officials are also shocked by the incident. "Patil is a quiet person, and we do not know why anyone would attack him," said Prasad Thakur, public relations officer, KDMC.
