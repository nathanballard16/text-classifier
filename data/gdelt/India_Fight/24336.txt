Shrenu Parikh continues to shoot despite getting her fingers burnt

MUMBAI: Actor Shrenu Parikh, who is currently seen playing the role of Janhvi Mittal in StarPlus’ Ek Bhram Sarvagun Sampanna, said she burned her fingers while shooting for a sequence.

What do you think about this Showtee?

Always seen playing goodie-goodie roles, this is the first time Shrenu is playing a positive and negative character for which she is working hard day and night. While shooting for a sequence, Shrenu had to wrap her hand around a flaming diya and walk towards her co-stars. To this she says, “We were shooting for a sequence where I had to cover the flaming lamp with my hand and walk towards my co-star. Unknowingly, I took my fingers too close to the flame and got burned. But I knew the expressions and shot was perfect so I decided not to say cut and went ahead and gave the shot.”

Kudos, to you, Shrenu!
