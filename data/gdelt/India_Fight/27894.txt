Prosecution proved the case against Bhandari on the basis of her dying statement and other evidences,” said A R Tripathi, district government pleader, Valsad.On October 19, 2015, mother of the deceased had gone to her farm while her elder brother was in school. Convict Bhandari came to consume liquor at the residence of the deceased. He tried to show obscene videos and photos to the minor girl and asked her to do as in the videos. The minor girl objected to his behaviour and went out of the house. The convict followed her and poured kerosene on her from a container. He then torched her and escaped from the spot.The minor girl was shifted to a hospital by her mother and neighbours where she died during treatment. She described the entire incident in her dying declaration to a magistrate based on which the police arrested the accused from his house in Umargam.“The prosecution demanded maximum punishment for Bhandari since the victim happened to be a minor and was murdered in a gruesome manner for refusing him sexual favours. The prosecution requested the court to set an example for such people by giving the convict strict punishment,” Tripathi said.
