Delhi: Bike-borne men kill man outside his house in Sangam Vihar

The victim has been identified as Nishant Sharma.

A man was shot dead by unknown assailants outside his house in Delhi's Sangam Vihar.

The incident took place in A Block of Sangam Vihar under the Tigri police station area.

The victim, identified as Nishant Sharma, was standing outside his house when bike-borne men came and fired at him.

When Nishant's neighbours took him to the nearby Batra hospital, he was declared dead.

According to people at the spot, a loud noise was heard late on Tuesday night. When they went to inspect the commotion, they found that Nishant had been shot in the back of his head.

As of now, the motive behind the murder is not known but it has been suggested that personal enmity may be behind the incident.

However, sources suggest that the firing may have been triggered by a gang war in the area.

A relative of Nishant said that many people had been previously killed in gang wars in Sangam Vihar.

While the police have not given an official statement on the incident as of now, they have started a probe based on CCTV footage and are inquiring from locals in the area.
