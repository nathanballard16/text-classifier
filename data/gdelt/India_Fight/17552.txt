Cabbie’s tip helped me alert Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy : JD(S) woman leader

MANDYA: A JD(S) women’s wing leader claimed that she had — based on information from a cab driver from C — alerted CM HD Kumaraswamy on Wednesday night about possible income tax raids on political leaders and associates of PWD minister HD Revanna. The woman — who covered her face in the video in an attempt to conceal her identity — said the cabbie worked in Bengaluru. In the video, posted to social media immediately after news spread on Thursday about the statewide raids, she said the cabbie’s suspicions were aroused on Tuesday by bookings of a large number of SUVs to Hassan, Mandya and Shivamogga for the next day. The woman, who JD(S) functionaries confirmed was a party leader in Mandya district, did not identify the cabbie or say what had confirmed his hunch that the vehicles had been booked to transport I-T officials.“The cab driver called me [on Tuesday] and shared details about how many vehicles had been booked, what time they would arrive at the airport, and where they were heading to,” she said.She then tipped off minister CS Puttaraju and other JD(S) leaders who passed on the information to the chief minister.Kumaraswamy told reporters in Mandya on Wednesday night that he had “received information that up personnel were preparing to swoop down on politicians” ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.
