Two people involved in the shootout managed to flee. Police said they have ientified them and efforts are on to nab them.

The policeman who shot dead one of the criminals will be awarded and his name will be recommended for out-of-turn promotion, the officer said.

A case of murder has been registered at Bindapur police station, the officer said.
