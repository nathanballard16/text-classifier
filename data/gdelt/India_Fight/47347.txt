New Delhi: Barely a month after Army General Bipin Rawat suggested terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot was activated and that over 500 people are waiting to infiltrate into India via Jammu and Kashmir, government sources on Monday said that at least 45-50 terrorists, including suicide bombers, are currently training at a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist facility in Balakot.

According to reports, Indian intelligence agencies are constantly monitoring the terrorist facility in Balakot. The facility was closed for six months after the Indian Air Force (IAF) attacked it in February last year.

Earlier in September, General Bipin Rawat told media that Balakot was once again activated by Pakistan. "This shows Balakot was affected, it was damaged, it highlights some action was taken by the Indian Air Force at Balakot and now they have got the people back there," he had said.

The Army Chief had also asserted that more Indian troops were deployed in the region to deal with any infiltration bid from across the border and that there was no hesitation on the Indian side to go beyond strikes in Balakot next time.

Back in February this year, IAF personnel flew into Pakistan and bombed the JeM facility in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Balakot region. The preemptive attack on a non-military but terrorist camp installation had been carried out a couple of weeks after a suicide bombing in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama that killed over 40 CRPF personnel.
