Selfie tourism is on at crime site

Police now does not allow any vehicle to be parked.

Hyderabad: Rape tourism: people are visiting the scene of the crime where “Disha” was raped and murdered, stopping their cars and bikes, and clicking photos as souvenirs. Some even took selfies.

Police are finding these voyeurs tough to handle and chase away. Sometimes entire families turn out for this ghoulish exercise. While the police try to shoo one set of photo-shooters away, another will come from behind to do the same. Policemen claimed they could not even take a bio-break.

The open plot where the crime took place has been cleaned of weeds and bushes; the wall has been broken and cleared. It is next to the toll gate at Shamshabad, where lorries are usually parked. Police now does not allow any vehicle to be parked.

A road leads to the Chatanpalli bridge where Disha’s body was burnt, but few-er people come here as it is under the bridge, and people feel spooked. Still, it is not exempt from the odd voyeur.
