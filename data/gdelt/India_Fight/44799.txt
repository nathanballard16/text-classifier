Bigg Boss 13 goes environment-friendly, bans the use of plastic on the sets

All eyes are on the premiere episode of Bigg Boss 13 which is slated to go on-air on September 29. The BB house has shifted its base to Mumbai this year and has been constructed on an area of 1800 square feet. The show which is returning with the 13th season will witness a few new additions and one amongst them is an eco-friendly set. The makers have banned the usage of plastic on the sets."We have tried to do on the other sets also and over here too. We are reducing the use of plastic, we know it is heavy on the pocket, but we are doing our bit. Plastic and thermocol were easier, simpler, lighter and cheaper but as Indian citizens, we need to think about the larger picture. We used POP and fibre, which is long-lasting," said Omung Kumar , art director."We have tried to reduce the use of plastic as much as we could. This is done basically to reduce pollution. We have used more fibre and different plaster of paris (POP)," he addedBigg Boss house has shifted base to Filmcity in Mumbai from Lonavala and there were speculations that it was done to accommodate host Salman Khan's busy shooting schedule."Salman never had a problem. This was largely done for the convenience of the team who have families in Mumbai. We were toying with the idea of getting it here since last two-three years and fortunately it materialised," said Abhishek Rege (Chief Executive Officer at Endemol India Pvt Ltd).
