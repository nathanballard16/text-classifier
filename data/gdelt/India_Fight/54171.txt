Accused snatched weapons from cops and opened fire at them: Cyberabad Police commissioner VC Sajjanar

HYDERABAD: Eleven years after three men were sensationally killed in an encounter after murdering a woman in an acid attack in Warangal, four men were gunned down in the early hours of Friday by the Telangana Police for allegedly raping and killing a veterinary doctor in Hyderabad. The officer who played a key role in both the encounters is 1996-batch IPS officer VC Sajjanar Following the arrests of Mohammed Areef, Shiva, Naveen and Chennakesavulu, who were allegedly involved in the gang rape and murder of the veterinarian, there had been a strong demand for instant justice across the nation -- a situation reminiscent of what took place in 2008.In 2008, Sajjanar, then Warangal superintendent of police, sent a team of investigators and the three accused to reconstruct the crime scene. The accused Srinivas Rao, P Hari Krishna, B Sanjay allegedly tried to snatch weapons from the police at the crime scene. In self defense the police opened fire and killed the accused in the early hours. Following this encounter, Sajjanar became a household name and was hailed as a hero.Fast forward to December 6, 2019, where on National Highway-44 at Chattanpally, locals were seen bursting crackers and raising slogans once again in favour of Sajjanar, who is now the commissioner of police, Cyberabad, after the four accused were gunned down. The encounter took place just a few metres away from the underpass where the veterinary doctor was burnt to death. Sajjanar in the wee hours of Friday had sent a team of policemen, along with the four accused - Areef, Naveen, Shiva and Chennakesavulu - to reconstruct the crime scene. As the accused allegedly attempted to attack the policemen at the spot, the police in retaliation opened fire and killed them all.
