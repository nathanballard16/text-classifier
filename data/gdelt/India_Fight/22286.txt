Hit 5 of 6 Balakot targets, says IAF internal report

NEW DELHI: The IAF achieved its strategic and operational aim of bombing the Jaish-e-Mohammed(JeM) terror facility in Balakot in Pakistan , hitting five of the six designated targets, but faltered on the propaganda war front, an internal review document of the force has said.If the IAF had “higher levels of technological asymmetry” compared to the Pakistan Air Force , which has boosted its capabilities since the 1999 Kargil conflict, then it would have inflicted heavy damage during the aerial skirmish on February 27, it said.The IAF document corroborates a series of TOI reports, ranging from the successful use of Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs by Mirage-2000 fighters in the February 26 pre-dawn air strikes to the simultaneous deployment of a ‘decoy package’ of Sukhoi-30MKI jets ostensibly headed towards the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur that lured Pakistani combat air patrols away from the actual ‘strike package’.According to sources, the document, which includes various lessons learnt, said the Spice-2000 bombs with penetration warheads hit five of six “designated mean points of impact” on the buildings within the JeM facility to achieve “complete and total strategic surprise”.The Spice-2000 bombs, pre-fed with “digital scene-matching area correlators”, pierced the roofs to kill all the “soft-skinned” inmates inside with shock and blast waves, without much external damage. But no accurate assessment of the casualties was possible, the review said.Sources also said if fragmentation bombs had been used to flatten the buildings, probably the scepticism shown by some international media organisations about the effectiveness of the air strikes would have been curbed.But heavy cloud cover during the strikes ensured that neither could the Mirage-2000s use their entire weapons packages, which included AGM-142 Crystal Maze missiles, nor did the IAF get clear video footage of the destruction. Better evidence would have been possible if the Crystal Maze missiles, with their data links and live video feeds, had been used. “There could have been better weapon-to-target matching and clear video footage to win the propaganda war as well,” a source said.
