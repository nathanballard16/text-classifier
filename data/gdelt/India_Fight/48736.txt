J&K: Army JCO Martyred In Pakistan Firing In Nowshera; 2 Civilians Injured

Earlier in the day, two civilians, including a woman, were injured in heavy Pakistan shelling along the LoC in Poonch district, officials said. One of them is a 6o-year-old woman. She was shifted to a government hospital in Rajouri for treatment. "She has a firearm injury in her left abdomen," said the doctor.

An Army officer was killed while two civilians were injured in the continuous firing from Pakistani side along the LoC. The Army officer was killed in a gunfight with terrorists who had sneaked into Indian territory taking cover of firing from the Pakistani side in Rajouri, and the two civilians were injured in cross-border shelling on villages along the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday. In the gunfight with terrorists who had sneaked into Indian territory, a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the Army got fatally injured and later succumbed to his injuries. "Today, a JCO was killed in Nowshera sector," a defence spokesman said in a brief statement following the fresh ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the LoC in Rajouri district.
