SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, June 18 (Xinhua) -- An Indian army trooper and two militants were killed Tuesday in a fierce gunfight in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.

The gunfight broke out in village Marhama of Anantnag district, about 40 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Two militants were killed in a gunfight with government forces at Marhama today," a senior police official posted in Anantnag told Xinhua. "A trooper was also killed fighting these militants."

The slain militants according to police were identified as local cadres of Jaish -e- Mohammed militant outfit.

The outfit was responsible for this year's deadly suicide bombing on Indian paramilitary convoy in the region that left over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel dead. The attack brought India and Pakistan at the brink of war.

On Monday an army officer was killed and two troopers wounded in a similar gunfight in Anantnag district. A militant was also killed during the stand-off.

The last few weeks have seen a sudden increase in the number of gunfights and militant killings in the region.

Militant groups opposing New Delhi's rule are engaged in a guerilla war with Indian troops in the region since 1989. Gunfight between the two sides takes place intermittently.

Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.
