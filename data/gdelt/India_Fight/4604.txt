"We give our warriors outdated machines to fight", moving note by wife of IAF pilot who died in Mirage-2000 crash

Here is the poem written by Garima Abrol that is going viral on social media:

New Delhi: Martyred Squadron Leader Samir Abrol’s wife Garima Abrol has penned down a touching note on the death of her husband, which is rapidly being circulated on the social media. She shared a picture of the late IAF pilot on Instagram and attacked the government in hard-hitting lines: “We give our warriors outdated machines to fight, they still deliver it with all their prowess and might.” The image she shared had a bottom-line “let us pledge to expose the cause of lost pilots”. Abrol was among the two IAF pilots killed recently when a Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft crashed during a test sortie at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited runway in Bengaluru. The other Squadron Leader, who was killed was Siddharth Negi.
