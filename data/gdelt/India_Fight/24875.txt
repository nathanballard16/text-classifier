A Bangladeshi man was allegedly tortured and killed by India’s Border Security Force (BSF) along the border in Satkhira Sadar upazila, according to the deceased man’s family.

The incident occurred during the early hours of Saturday.

The deceased is Kabirul Islam, 32.

His body was discovered near Kushkhali border in Satkhira Sadar upazila. The doctors declared him dead after his body was taken to a hospital.

Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) said they have no information indicating BSF’s involvement in the murder.

Faruk Hossain, uncle of the deceased, said: “My nephew crossed the border Friday night to Dudoli in India. He went there to bring tea leaves.”

Faruk said his nephew was captured by BSF and severely beaten.

“They poured petrol into his mouth and on his body,” he said.

His family said Kabirul was dumped at the border. He was later taken to Satkhira Sadar Hospital where the doctors declared him dead around 12am.

Kushkhali UP Chairman Shafiqul Islam said: “Kabirul went into India to bring tea leaves. He was severely tortured.”

Satkhira Sadar police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Mostafizur Rahman said: “We have found markings on his body that indicate he was tortured. We cannot say for sure if petrol was poured into his mouth without a proper medical examination.”

The OC said the body would be sent for autopsy.

Nayek Subedar Arif of Kushkhali BGB said he was not aware of any such incident.

Lt Col Golam Mohiuddin Khandakar, commanding officer of BGB-33 Battalion, said: “I have heard of the incident. But we have not received any information that said BSF is responsible.”

“BSF told us they did not capture any Bangladeshis,” he said.
