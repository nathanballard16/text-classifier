India-Pakistan de-escalation?

Sir: It is laudable that senior Pakistani and Indian High Commission’s officials vowed to maintain peace agreement of 2003. The senior officials agreed to ‘fully implement the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit forthwith and to ensure that henceforth the ceasefire will not be violated by both sides’. But, such bonhomie is tangential to gung-ho optics of Indian military and civil leaders. Take Rear Admiral DS Gujral warning, at joint defence briefing March 1, 2019, to Pakistan to desist from any “misadventure”. Or, Admiral Sunil Lanba’s threats about “seaborne terrorism” to Pakistan at the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue in New Delhi on March 5, 2019.

The Pulwama incident and subsequent Indian Air Force’s attack brought one lesson home to the world: Kashmir is not an integral part of India. It is a disputed state, a veritable nuclear tinderbox.
