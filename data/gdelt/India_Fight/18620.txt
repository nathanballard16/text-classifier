Modi-Mamata war of words heat up battleground Bengal – Chennaionline

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fought a vicious war of words during the course of three major public meetings in the state on Wednesday, heating up the electoral battle just eight days before first phase of polling for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

While Modi termed Banerjee “a speed breaker in way of Bengal’s development” and claimed her rule in Bengal will come to an end soon, the Trinamool Congress supremo dubbed him an “expiry babu” and a “fascist leader.”

Modi, who flew across the length of Bengal on Wednesday to address two mammoth rallies — one in north Bengal’s Siliguri and the other in Kolkata’s iconic Brigade Parade Ground, claimed the massive turn out and enthusiasm in both the rallies show that Banerjee’s boat had sunk.
