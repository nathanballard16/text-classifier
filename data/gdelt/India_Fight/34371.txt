Tattoo helps police nab rogue biker who dragged traffic cop and tried to flee after hitting elderly

The person, identified as Daneshwar Jha (19), was nabbed from Panchanna Gram, adjacent to EM Bypass on Saturday. Jha had fled to Varanasi two days after the act to evade arrest but returned to the city two days back. The police then tracked similar types of rash driving by motorcyclists in the area and cultivated local sources to identify the offender. The cops, while they were planning to send a team to Varanasi, learnt that he had come back. Tapan Orang, a constable of the East Traffic Guard, suffered serious injuries on his hands and legs in the incident.
