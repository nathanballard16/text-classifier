New Delhi:

Amid clashes among inmates at the high-security Srinagar Central Jail, two inmates were injured and at least three barracks and a building were damaged. There were rumours that some inmates were being shifted out of the Kashmir valley. This triggered protests. The officials said that the jail inmates were also protesting against the construction of new barracks. During protests, the inmates also burned a temporary shelter. The authorities have imposed restrictions on the movement of people around the jail located in Downtown Srinagar. Internet speed in Srinagar, Anantnag and Kulgam districts have also been reduced.

"There were no casualties or injuries," the police added. Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh, who is also DG Prisons, said that some inmates instigated others to stop the repair and reinforcement works inside a barrack, according to the local media. The inmates also tried to come to the outer cordon of the jail located in the downtown area of the city, officials said as reported by India Today.

Senior police officers and additional companies of the CRPF were rushed to the jail to bring the situation under control, the officials added.
