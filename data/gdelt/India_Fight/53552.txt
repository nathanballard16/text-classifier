Outrage mounts over Indian vet’s rape, murder

KOLKATA: Outrage is mounting in India after the alleged rape and murder of a 27-year-old vet in the city of Hyderabad.

Thousands protested outside a police station in the city, demanding accountability.

Police have suspended three officers.

Meanwhile family members have turned away visiting politicians and police officials, demanding action instead.

Rape and violence against women remain at high levels despite widespread public anger at high-profile cases.

The victim’s charred remains were discovered after she disappeared on Wednesday.

Police allege she was gang-raped before she was killed.

Four men have been arrested in connection with the case.

Two of their mothers have spoken out, calling for them to be punished if they are found guilty.

“You give whatever punishment (to them). I have a daughter too,” one told The Press Trust of India.

At a police station on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Saturday, thousands of people gathered to protest, insisting the culprits must face the death penalty.
