Viscosupplementation Market Highlights:

MRFR has segmented the global viscosupplementation market on the basis of various parameters in order to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the market. The leading players and segments dominating the global viscosupplementation market are also profiled in the report.

Viscosupplementation is a procedure used to refill the lubricating fluid in bone joints. Hyaluronic acid is a major component of viscosupplementation formulations, as hyaluronic acid is normally found abundantly in joint fluid but decreases in volume in arthritic joints. Supplementing the hyaluronic acid externally provides the patients with a stable reserve of joint fluid, which is vital in managing and combating arthritis. Viscosupplementation is used to treat knee pain, hip pain, shoulder, as well as to inhibit the progression of osteoarthritis.
