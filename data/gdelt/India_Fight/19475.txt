Alia Bhatt on romantic moments with Ranbir Kapoor at Filmfare Awards: Wasn't an announcement of relationship

Alia Bhatt is head over heels in love with Ranbir Kapoor. It's very rare that we get to see Ranbir and Alia indulging in PDA even if they've made many appearances together. Recently, at the Filmfare Awards 2019, when Alia Bhatt won the Best Actress Award, in her speech, she pointed at Ranbir and said, "Tonight is all about love; there, my special one, I love you."

Similarly, when Ranbir Kapoor was called for his award, he kissed Alia before walking up to the stage to take his award. The videos of these romantic and cute moments between the couple went viral on the internet. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Alia Bhatt was asked if those actions were an official confirmation of their relationship. Bhatt said, "That was not an announcement. And I don't need to defend what I did because it was very personal."

Meanwhile, the actors fell in love while they were shooting for Ayan Mukerji's Brahmastra in Bulgaria in 2017. When Ranbir and Alia appeared together at Sonam K Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's wedding reception last year in May, everyone figured out that they are more than just co-stars and friends.

Later, in an interview with a magazine last year, Ranbir Kapoor confirmed that he and Alia Bhatt are indeed together. Their fans then started addressing them as RaLia.

Last month, in an interview with Filmfare, Alia Bhatt shared that being with Ranbir Kapoor makes her feels like she is walking on stars and clouds and called him a gem.

Coming to Brahmastra, the film also stars Amitabh Bachchan and Mouni Roy. The film will hit the theatres during the Christmas this year.
