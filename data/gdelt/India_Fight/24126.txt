Three years on, why the elections in Anantnag, J&K would be staggered

Pulwama is part of Anantnag parliament constituency where elections are being held in three phases. In the last two phases in Anantnag and Kulgam districts, the voter turnout was a dismal 12 per cent. The voting in Anantnag Lok Sabha is being held in three phases because of the security situation in the region.

As per reports, all the 450 polling stations in the district have been declared hypersensitive. Based on the security assessment, polling booths located deep inside villages were relocated and shifted to safer locations.

Because of fears of violence the administration has spread polling in Anantnag over phases. While Anantnag and the adjoining areas went to polls on April 23, Shopian and Pulwama are voting today.
