Mohit, who hailed from Haryana’s Bahadurgarh was talking to his friend when three men barged into the shop and fired indiscriminately.

According to police, the assailants had fired around 13 bullets out of which seven hit Mohit.

"He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead," a senior police officer told IANS.

The 27-year-old fitness enthusiast was a popular figure on Tik Tok where he used to post his workout videos and had more than 5 lakh followers.

Police have launched a manhunt for the three accused. Even though they were caught on CCTV camera, fleeing the crime scene, none of them have been identified so far.

Police also said there was no immediate indication of the motive behind the murder. Even though the initial suspicion is on a personal rivalry, the murder which happened just days after a gang war and shootout in Dwarka Mor where two notorious gangsters were killed has led police to look into any possible links.

The investigators however clarified that there were no records of Mohit being associated with any gangs and that he did not have a criminal history.
