Akhilesh Yadav on dad Mulayam: Netaji blessed Manmohan Singh too, did he become PM again?

What does Akhilesh Yadav, one of the main opposition figures standing in BJP's way in Uttar Pradesh, a key election battleground, think of his father's praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi?

"Didn't he [Mulayam Singh Yadav] congratulate and bless Dr Manmohan Singh? Did he return to power?" the Samajwadi Party (SP) leader asked in an interview at the India Today Conclave on Saturday, in New Delhi.

Mulayam Singh Yadav, a veteran socialist leader who lead the SP for decades until 2017, when his leadership ended following a public feud with Akhilesh, praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament last month.

"I wish that PM Modi, you should become the prime minister again. I have experienced that whenever I met you, you got my work done instantly," he said.

BATTLEGROUND U.P. TO SEE SP-BSP vs BJP CLASH

Like his father, Akhilesh Yadav is a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 of the Lok Sabha's 543 elected members to Parliament.

Currently governed by a BJP government, Uttar Pradesh is all set for a fascinating clash between the ruling party and an alliance between Samajwadi Party and former rival Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

The two parties have also joined forces in Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

The BJP performed well in the 2014 Lok Sabha election in Uttar Pradesh, winning a lion's share of seats along with its ally Apna Dal. In 2017, it crushed rivals like the SP and BSP in the state election, winning more than two-thirds of the seats in a House with over 400 members.

But after the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh, it has lost Lok Sabha bypolls in the state, including one in Gorakhpur, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's former constituency.
