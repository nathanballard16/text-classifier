The accused Jisav Rathod was arrested late on Tuesday night after the deceased Rauji Vasava ’s son identified him.According to police, Vasava and his six-year-old son were sleeping in their house at Navi Mangrol settlement in Dabhoi taluka on Monday night. A few minutes past midnight, Rathod entered the house and slit Vasav’s throat using a knife over some past enmity. Rathod did not harm Vasava’s son, but the killer did not realize that he was awake and had witnessed the killing of his 27-year-old father.Police said that the little boy was scared so he did not move for a while. But later he went to his uncle in the adjacent house and informed them about how Rathod had killed his father. The police was alerted about the crime and a formal complaint of murder was lodged by Vasava’s brother against Rathod at Dabhoi police station.“Based on the complaint, we have arrested Rathod, but the reason for the killing will be known during his interrogation.We suspect that there could be some enmity between the duo, due to which Rathod would have killed Vasava,” said deputy superintendent of police K V Solanki.
