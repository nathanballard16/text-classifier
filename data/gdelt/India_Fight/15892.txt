Photos: Shah Rukh Khan’s son AbRam hides his face to evade the shutterbugs

Shah Rukh Khan’s love for his younger son AbRam is hidden from no one as the superstar takes his little munchkin along with him on shoots as well as tours to foreign countries. The two were currently enjoying a vacay in London and were spotted today at the Mumbai airport as they returned.While Shah Rukh, who was spotted sporting a salt-and-pepper beard looked quite his usual while greeting the shutterbugs at the airport, AbRam tried to hide his face with the help of a soft toy which he was carrying. This isn't the first time that he has done this as earlier too he had said no pictures to the paparazzi while leaving Aaradhya Bachchan’s birthday party.Meanwhile, on the work front, Shah Rukh Khan has reportedly opted out of Rakesh Sharma biopic titled 'Saare Jahan Se Achcha' as his last outing 'Zero' failed to impress the audience.
