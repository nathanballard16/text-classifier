New Delhi: Amid recent uproar over his altercations with the Trinamool Congress-ruled state administration, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar was on Thursday accorded with ‘Z’ category VIP security cover by the Union Home Ministry. Dhankar had claimed that he had got ‘potential threats’ lately.

The Union government issued the order and directed the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to take over Dhankar’s security cover, which will be valid across the country.

As per the ‘Z’ category security cover, the Bengal Governor will have around 8-10 armed security personnel tailing him whenever and wherever he travels. The CRPF is expected to take over the charge soon, according to a report by news agency PTI.

According to central government officials, a threat assessment report was prepared by central intelligence and security agencies and it was found that Dhankar required a professional team of security personnel following the recent incident when Union minister Babul Supriyo was heckled at Jadavpur University and Dhankar had rushed to the former’s rescue.

The CRPF is assigned as a security cover for a number of VIPs in the country, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Dhankar had ruffled feathers with the Mamata Banerjee government after he blamed the state administration over the horrific murder of a school teacher and his family in Murshidabad district, and said that it was a reflection on the state of law and order in the state.
