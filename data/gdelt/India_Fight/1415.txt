Victim of doctor’s brutality finally traced

RAJKOT: In the sensational case where a doctor of a private hospital is seen thrashing his hospital staffer in video that viral early this week, the victim employee, who had been missing for the past 22 days, was traced on Wednesday night.Police said the victim Mayur Mori, was found from the old toll booth on Morbi Road in Rajkot.“Mori said after Dr Shyam Rajani, who runs Lifecare Hospital on Kuvadva Road, thrashed him in his SUV and sacked him. He then went to Kutch in search of a job,” said R S Thakar, inspector of Rajkot B division police station.“He had switched of his cellphone as he was scared. When he returned to Rajkot on Wednesday night, he switched on his phone, following which he was traced as his number was under surveillance,” Thakar added.Meanwhile, more trouble was in store for Rajani, who was arrested on Monday after the video showing him beating up Mori had gone viral.Police said that Rajani’s MBBS and MD degrees were bogus. A report has already been sent to Gujarat University by the Medical Council of India. The report is expected to be delivered to the health department of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) and Rajkot district health department soon.Meanwhile, the district health department on Wednesday night lodged a complaint against Dr Rajani for allegedly storing the medicines exclusively meant for government hospitals. “There were 32 medicines, including injections, with seals of government hospitals. They were seized from Dr Rajani’s clinic,” said Rajkot district health officer Dr Nilesh Rathod.“It is suspected that Rajani’s father Hemant Rajani allegedly supplied medicines to Rajani’s clinic from Rajkot Civil Hospital, from where he worked and retired recently,” said Dr Rathod.Earlier, the police had arrested Rahul Padhiyar, who had shot the video of Rajani thrashing Mori on Monday.Mori had been working in Lifecare Hospital for the past four to five years and was in-charge of making case papers.Preliminary investigation and conversation in the video suggested that Rajani suspected Mori of revealing some of this secret exploits to his wife Karishma Gandhi, which later led to their divorce.An audio clip also went viral in which Gandhi is purportedly heard making serious allegations about Rajani’s personal and professional life. She is heard saying that she knows about his ‘loose character’ and fake degrees. She also alleged that Rajani had studied Bachelors of Homoeopathic Medicine (BAMS) for just two years but continued practising with a fake MD degree.
