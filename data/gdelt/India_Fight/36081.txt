Mark Bloomfield, Mother Teresa’s Former Assistant, Killed In Swansea Pub Brawl

Mark Bloomfield, 54, apparently got into an altercation in a pub in Wales and died from his injuries. Three suspects are currently under investigation.

A former assistant to famed Catholic missionary Mother Teresa, who for decades ministered to the poor in India, died after getting into a bar fight in the United Kingdom.

Mark Bloomfield, 54, was taken to the hospital and died from the injuries he received during the alleged attack at the Full Moon Public House in the Welsh city of Swansea, according to South Wales Police Swansea and Neath Port Talbot.

The police have taken a 61-year-old man, who BBC has reported to be Colin Thomas Payne, into custody and are charging him with causing grievous bodily harm. A 21-year old man and a 50-year-old woman were arrested and released under investigation.

Bloomfield’s family stated that the charity work he did “built a legacy that will continue to live on in the countless lives that he encountered.” Aside from working with Mother Teresa, he helped girls in India receive education, organized free cataract surgery camps and helped preserve the wildlife in Africa.

“He will be remembered for all of this and more by his mother and three siblings,” the family said.

Detective Chief Inspector Darren George said that an incident room was set up for witnesses of the altercation or those with any information that will be beneficial to the investigation. He put out a call for anyone who may have recorded video footage of the incident to come forward "no matter how insignificant your information or content may seem."

Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950s and became famous for her work among the poor of Calcutta. She was made a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 2003, six years after her death.
