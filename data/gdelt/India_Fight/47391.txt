Send body to Bangladesh: Kin of man who died as ‘foreigner’

GUWAHATI: The death of a 65-year-old inmate of a foreigners’ detention centre in Assam on Sunday has led the man’s Sonitpur-based family to demand that his body be sent to Bangladesh if authorities cannot restore his “Indian citizenship”.Dulal Paul, who died at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital of multiple ailments, had been declared a “Bangladeshi” and sent to the detention centre in Sonitpur in 2017. His eldest son Ashish, a motor mechanic at Alisinga in the same district, said on Monday that he wouldn’t accept his father’s body till the government righted the wrong done to him. “I will take my father’s body home only when he is declared an Indian. My father was sent to the detention centre in 2017 after he was branded a Bangladeshi. Now that he is dead, why is the government forcing us to accept his body? My father died as a Bangladeshi despite being an Indian and owning land here since the 60s. Let them send his body to Bangladesh,” he said.Dulal’s family had sold off a portion of their land to pay for legal expenses after he was declared a foreigner and ordered to be sent to a detention centre. “We are poor, but we spent nearly Rs 1.5 lakh on my father’s case. He was suffering from mental illness and also developed diabetes later. We tried everything we could to get him out,” Ashish said. Dulal, who had been shifted to Guwahati last month for treatment, is the 26th inmate of a foreigners’ detention centre to die since 2011.Organisations representing the state’s Bengali community blocked roads at Alisinga in protest against his death while under detention.
