Little-known J&K party speaks out

SRINAGAR: A political outfit held a press conference in the Valley on Monday for the first time after J&K’s special status was withdrawn last month. Four members of a little-known party, J&K Political Movement (Independent), demanded restoration of statehood with a semblance of freedom that mainstream political leaders under detention have not had for more than a month. Mohammed Shahid Khan, chief spokesperson of JKPM(I), said at the makeshift media facilitation centre in Srinagar that the Centre must “maintain status-quo” on the democratic rights of the people of J&K. Khan claimed that JKPM(I) has representation in a number of panchayats and local urban bodies. He said one of the priorities of his party was to mobilise support to “build pressure” on the government to “clarify dou- bts” on various issues like setting up industries, investment by outsiders and reservation of jobs in Kashmir for non-Kashmiris. They also urged the government to release “all youths detained by it”, saying it would serve as “a confidence-building measure and bring normalcy”.8 LeT terrorists held in J&K Eight terrorists of Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested in Sopore area of J&K, police said on Monday. “Terror module of Lashkar-e-Taiba outfit involving eight individuals arrested in Sopore,” Kashmir Zone Police said on Twitter.
