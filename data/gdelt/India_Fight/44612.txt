Security forces recovers 40 kg explosives in J&K's Kathua, averts major terror attack

Averting what could have been a major terror attack in the Valley, the security forces on Monday recovered 40 kg of explosives from Jammu and Kashmir's (J&K) Kathua region, as per sources.

Earlier in the day, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat while speaking to media on Monday said that Pakistan has reactivated the terror camp in Balakot as more than 500 terrorists are waiting to infiltrate from across the border.

Ever since India's move on Article 370, Pakistan backed terror groups are desperately trying to infiltrate terrorists from across the border into the Valley.

On Sunday, Pakistan once again violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir with mortars being fired in Mendhar sector of Poonch district. According to reports, the firing started around 4.15 pm.

The Indian Army also gave a befitting reply to this unprovoked firing and shelling. Shahpur and Kerni sectors of Poonch were also on the target at 9.45 am.

On September 15, India raised concerns regarding more than 2,050 unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces this year.

Meanwhile, Mukesh Singh, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Jammu Zone while speaking to media on Monday said that in the past one-year, four incidents of terrorists have taken place in Kishtwar.

Due to the continuous efforts of Kishtwar police, assisted by CRPF, army and NIA team, they have been able to solve all these 4 cases of the past one-year.
