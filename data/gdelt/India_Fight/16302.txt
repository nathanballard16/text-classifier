Opp is natural habitat of terror apologists: PM Modi slams Ramgopal Yadav's statement calling Pulwama a 'conspiracy'

UP Chief Minister alleged that such "shameful" statements are a "part of the conspiracy to demoralise brave soldiers" and demanded an apology from Yadav.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday slammed Samajwadi Party general secretary Ramgopal Yadav for his "shameful" remarks over the Pulwama attack, terming them the "height of appeasement".

"Questioning the martyrdom of brave soldiers by SP General Secretary Ramgopal Yadav is the height of appeasement. It is indicative of petty politics," Yogi Adityanath said here.

UP Chief Minister alleged that such "shameful" statements are a "part of the conspiracy to demoralise brave soldiers" and demanded an apology from Yadav.

"Ramgopal Yadav should apologise to the country for making such statements which encourage terrorists," he said.

"Everyone knows that our brave soldiers were killed the people accused of carrying Pulwama attack within 48 hours," Adityanath added.

Meanwhile PM Modi said: "Opposition is the natural habitat of terror apologists and questioners of our armed forces. This reprehensible statement by a senior leader like Ram Gopal Ji insults all those who have given their lives in protecting Kashmir. It humiliates the families of our martyrs."
