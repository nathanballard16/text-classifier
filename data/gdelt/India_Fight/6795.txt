Bhopal: At a time when an entire nation is mourning the tragic deaths of 40 CRPF jawans who were killed by a suicide bomber in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, the words of Rabindranath Tagore resonate with present-day India, "Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark."

Countless stories of heart-warming tributes to the slain soldiers are pouring in from across the length and breadth of the country. One such story is that of an 11-year-old girl from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. A resident of Durganagar in the Arera Hills area of the state capital, Muskan Ahirwar decided to donate all the money she saved for her birthday to the Sainik Kalyan Fund in honour of the brave men of the CRPF who lost their lives in the line of duty.

Speaking to media outlets, Muskan said that her birthday was on February 15, a day after the deadly attack shook the nation. A total of Rs 680 that I had saved in my piggy bank for my birthday along with the money I collected from my friends amounted to Rs 1,100, said Muskan. The schoolgirl with a heart of gold then handed over the money to the office superintendent of the District Sainik Kalyan Office (DSKO).

In fact, Muskan has also been running a library for slum kids under the banner of 'Baal Pustakalaya' from her home. The Class 6 student told News18, "At a time when our soldiers are dying in cowardly terror attacks, how can I celebrate my birthday."
