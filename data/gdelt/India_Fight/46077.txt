Filmmaker Guneet Monga talks about guerrilla filmmaking on an iPhone

Mumbai, Oct 4 : Acclaimed producer Guneet Monga described shooting her new short film, "Chajjo Ke Dahi Bhalle", on an iPhone XS Max in the streets of Amritsar as guerrilla filmmaking. She added that a lot of filmmakers adapt this style lately, especially for docu-dramas, because it makes life easier while shooting.

"We shot this film in Amritsar and could get into small lanes and markets and streets outside Golden Temple only because our shooting device was extremely compact. A lot of filmmakers practice guerrilla filmmaking especially for docudramas and shooting on phone made their lives easier," Monga said.

"Chajjo Ke Dahi Bhalle" is directed by Gautam Govind Sharma. It is a tale of neighbourly love in the times of technology starring Aisha Ahmed and Manjot Singh as the lead pair.

"The process of procuring permissions and the hassle it creates for those in the neighbourhoods can all be avoided with the use of technology," Monga added.

The film was entirely shot in Amritsar in August this year.
