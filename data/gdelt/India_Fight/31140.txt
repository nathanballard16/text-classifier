NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu urged on Friday to include yoga in school curriculum to combat lifestyle diseases and ensure physical fitness and mental equilibrium.

Naidu made the remarks while speaking at an event to mark the "International Day of Yoga" at the iconic Red Fort in Delhi.

“Instant food means constant disease," Naidu cautioned the attendees, particularly the youngsters, against eating junk food.

"There is a great need to introduce the subtle science of yoga, which everyone can use not just to achieve physical well-being, but also to lead a better life by making enlightened choices," he said.

People are encountering tremendous pressures in daily lives, and in his view, yoga, an old practice involving physical exercise and meditation, could use breathing techniques, bending, stretching, etc., to improve health.
