A massive fire broke out in the main building of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur today. The incident took place around 6 pm this evening.

Old furniture kept in the area inside the High Court building was gutted in the fire.

It is being reported that the fire inside the High Court building in Jabalpur occurred because of a short circuit. However, the exact cause behind the fire incident is yet to be ascertained.

Fire tenders reached the spot at Jabalpur's South Civil lines area almost 30 minutes after the blaze occurred, but by then the intensity of the fire magnified.

The fire started near the stairs in the north block of the High Court building and then spread to the first floor before being doused a few minutes after authorities were alerted at around 5:45 pm, said Jabalpur Municipal Corporation Fire Officer Kushagra Thakur.

There have been no reports of any casualties yet. The fire was put out soon.
