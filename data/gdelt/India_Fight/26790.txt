Three held for killing UP man over trivial issue

Policeman inspects crime spot

Rajkot: Three persons were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly murdering Uttar Pradesh man Ram Kirpal Verma (27) on Jangleshwar main road, opposite the entrance of a crematorium on Tuesday night.

The accused were identified as Dinesh Vala (27), Kishan Parmar (25) and Imtiyaz Sheikh (24). The crime was committed while one of the accused entered into an altercation with the deceased when they bumped into each other near the entrance of the crematorium on Jangleshwar main road.

“The murder was the result of a trivial issue in which Vala hurled abuse at Verma, following which Verma slapped him. This enraged Parmar who stabbed Verma in his leg, severing his blood vessel. As Verma started bleeding profusely, Vala, Parmar and Sheikh, who was sitting in a rickshaw with Verma, fled from the spot,” said V K Gadhvi, inspector with Bhaktinagar police station.

Verma used to work at the weighbridge on 80-feet Road and lived with a room partner at Ekta Colony in Jangleshwar.
