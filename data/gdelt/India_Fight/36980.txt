VG Siddhartha, whose Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) was India's answer to Starbucks and Costa Coffee, was found dead on the banks of Netravati River in Mangaluru on Wednesday morning.

His body was found after 36 hours of an intense search operation by the Karnataka Police and NDRF. VG Siddhartha's letter had alleged harassment by the income tax authorities and a private equity partner, which allegedly caused a liquidity crunch in his company.

Under pressure over rising competition and a debt of over Rs 6,500 crore, VG Siddhartha said in his letter that he had failed as an "entrepreneur".
