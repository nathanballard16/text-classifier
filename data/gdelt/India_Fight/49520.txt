A labourer, who was critically injured in a deadly attack by suspected militants in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kulgam district yesterday, is recovering at a hospital in Srinagar, PTI reported.

Five migrant labourers from West Bengal’s Murshidabad area were killed by suspected militants on Tuesday. The attack happened on the day a 23-member unofficial delegation of European Union MPs was in the Valley to take “first-hand account” of the “ground situation in Kashmir”.

The five killed Tuesday evening have been identified as Naimuddin Sheikh, Murshalim Sheikh, Rafikul Sheikh, Rafique Sheikh and Kamaruddin Sheikh, all from Bahalnagar village in Murshidabad’s Sagardighi. The injured labourer, who died today, also belonged from the same area.

Tuesday’s attack was the sixth in a string of incidents targeting non-residents in south Kashmir, and the second in 24 hours, taking the death toll to 11.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had condemned the killing of labourers. “We are shocked and deeply saddened at the brutal killings in Kashmir. Five workers from Murshidabad lost their lives. Words will not take away the grief of the families of the deceased. All help will be extended to the families in this tragic situation,” she said.
