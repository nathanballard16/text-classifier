Pakistan arrests top militant figure ahead of prime minister’s visit to U.S.

One Indian government official sounded a note of skepticism about the arrest of Saeed. “This is not the first time that such action has been taken,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Pakistan has made arrests related to terrorism attacks in India in the past, but the suspects “have been allowed to walk free after some time.”
