Police seizes car with Osama Bin Laden sticker in Kollam

The owner of the car, Muhammad Haneef, 22, from Pallimukku here and driver Hareesh, 25, of Thanni were taken into custody and interrogated by the Eravipuram police.

Kollam: In the wake of intelligence reports about possible terror attacks in the state, a luxury car with the caricature of deceased Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was seized here on Thursday.

Though the police could not find any link to terrorist groups, the issue is being investigated by the local police.

The owner of the car, Muhammad Haneef, 22, from Pallimukku here and driver Hareesh, 25, of Thanni were taken into custody and interrogated by the Eravipuram police.

The car was plying under the nose of the police for nearly a year, but was seized only after its pictures turned viral on the social media. The photos of the car bearing a West Bengal registration number with Bin Laden’s caricature on its boot and his name written on the rear windshield were circulated on social media after it was spotted at Thattamala, Eravipuram and Mayyanad areas. A complaint about it was also received by higher police officials, following which action was taken.

The car was seized by Eravipuram police while it was being used by a young couple for their marriage at Ayathil on Thursday. Upon inspection, the car was found to be registered in the name of Praveen Agarval of West Bengal. Muhammad Haneef had bought the car about a year ago from his friend in Bengaluru for Rs 4.5 lakh, but the ownership was not yet changed. He told the police that the caricature of the terrorist was printed at a sticker shop at Mundakkal and intended just for fun. The police are further verifying the ownership details and whether the car is involved in crimes.
