Militants, security forces exchange fire in Kashmir - police

SRINAGAR, India - A gun battle erupted between security forces and militants in Indian Kashmir on Wednesday, two police sources said, the first since mobile phone links were restored in the region in an effort to restore normalcy after a prolonged shutdown.

Soldiers raided a village in south Kashmir, long a hotbed of separatist revolt, following intelligence reports that militants had taken shelter there, said the sources who declined to be identified.
