Congress asks the US to release Telugu students

Hyderabad: The Congress party on Thursday demanded immediate release of students hailing from Telugu States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, who have been detained by the USA Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on the charges of taking admissions into University of Farmington. They apparently seem to have believed that university of Farmington being established by USA government’s agency would not be a fraudulent university, he said. In an open letter to US Consul General in Hyderabad Katherine B. Hadda, AICC spokesperson Dr Dasoju Sravan said hundreds of students belonging to Telugu States had fallen victim to a trap laid by the US Home Land Security itself. These students belong to middle class families whose parents are teachers, farmers & small business owners. They have put their lifetime earnings for sending their Children for quality of education and better career,” Sravan said in his letter.
