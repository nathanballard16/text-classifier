“New year, new learnings… so the last whole month of 2018 went in enjoying the company of an animal, mother nature and sunrises… as I gear up to restart shooting for ‘Panipat’ I feel privileged to be able to learn this beautiful art of becoming one with this most glorious animal,” he captioned the image.

He added: “The process of learning has been therapeutic and empowering at the same time. Can’t wait to get back on set with this new childlike excitement for what is my toughest and biggest film yet.”
