New Delhi: Pakistan is hopeful if a re-engagement with India after the Lok Sabha elections. Pakistan's outgoing envoy Sohail Mahmood has batted for structured dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the disputes between the two countries. Mahmood, who has been appointed Pakistan's Foreign Secretary, said that there is also a need to review the narrative about Pakistan in India.

"We hope for re-engagement after the elections in India. Diplomacy and dialogue are indispensable," Mahmood told news agency PTI in an interview. The comments come just weeks after the two sides were locked in a military conflict over an attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 40 CRPF personnel.

"We must strive for a stable peace, equal security and shared prosperity for ourselves and the region," Mahmood told PTI. "There is also a need to review the narrative about Pakistan in India. A narrative is needed that captures the reality in Pakistan objectively and more fully. A narrative that also helps recognise opportunities for peaceful, cooperative and good neighbourly relations," he said.

The dialogue between India and Pakistan was suspended after the Pathankot airbase attack in January 2016. Post the attack, India made it clear that New Delhi would not engage with Islamabad until it stops supporting the mechanism that infiltrates terrorists into the Indian territory.

Most recently, following the Pulwama attack, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out strikes at Balakot in Pakistan and destroyed the Jaish e Mohammed terror camp at the site.

Commenting on the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, Mahmood said, "The government of Pakistan is proceeding in full measures to complete the physical infrastructure on its side and it is hopeful that the modalities will be mutually agreed between the two sides in good time before November 2019."
