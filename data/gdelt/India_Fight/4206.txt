Hyderabad: A Class X student and his friend were injured after a classmate attacked them with a beer bottle following a brawl. Sources blamed a common love interest for the fight between the two boys, but the police cited a monetary angle.

A case has been registered and further investigations are on. Sources, however, said the two students of the Zilla Parishad High School of Jillelaguda in Meerpet police station area of Rachakonda police commissionerate had fought over a girl.

They had got into an argument on Friday morning and another fight broke out on Saturday morning when one of the boys had stepped out to attend to nature’s call. One of the boys picked up a dumped beer bottle and attacked the other. A friend of the boy was also attacked. One suffered neck injuries and the other was hurt in the stomach.

“One of the boys owed money to the other and a fight broke out,” Meerpet police inspector Mr N. Yadaiah said. “In a fit of rage, one boy picked up a beer bottle and attacked his friend.”

Yadaiah denied the love affair angle. “It is not true. Some are even saying a fight between English medium and Telugu medium students while others are ascribing other reasons.”

Last October, two Class X students were burnt alive in an alleged clash over a girl in Telangana’s Jagtiyal town, about 190km from Hyderabad.

“Excess crime in movies, TV serials and social media is driving children towards negatively and sometimes even making criminals out of them,” Achyut Rao from Balala Hakkula Sangham said.

He demanded a ban on movies and TV serials that contain excess crime and vulgarity and also demanded counselling children before they are sent to boys’ homes.
