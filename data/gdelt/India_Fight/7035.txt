Hartal in Kerala's Kasargod after two Congress workers hacked to death

Suspected retaliatory attack by CPI(M) workers

Two Congress workers were hacked to death on Sunday night in a suspected retaliatory attack allegedly by Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers in Kasaragod district.

The deceased have been identified as Kripesh, 24, and Sarath Lal, 21, alias Joshi of Kaliyot, near Periya.

Kripesh died on the spot and Joshi died in a hospital in Mangaluru, the Bekal police said.

They were attending a temple festival at Kaliyot when they came under attack, the police said.

Hartal call

The Congress called for a hartal in Kasaragod district on Monday in protest against the murders.

Last month, Kripesh and 10 others were charged with the attempted murder of CPI((M) worker Peethambaran.

The incidents were a sequel to the political clashes at People’s Co-operative Arts and Science College at Munnad. KSU workers of the college had complained that they were manhandled by the SFI students and CPI(M) workers. In a retaliatory attack, Congress workers had allegedly attacked Peethambaran last month.
