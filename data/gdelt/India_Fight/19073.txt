Mamata Banerjee complains to EC, calls removal of top cops arbitrary

KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday shot off a two-page letter to the Election Commission, calling its decision to transfer four senior state cops ahead of the general election “arbitrary, motivated and biased”.The EC, in a late-evening decision on Friday, replaced the Kolkata and Bidhannagar police commissioners and the Diamond Harbour and Birbhum superintendents of police; the order also mentioned that the four IPS officers could not be allotted any poll-related duty.Banerjee’s letter on Saturday said the EC action was “prima facie undemocratic and suffers from principles of natural justice”. She also urged the EC to review its decision and enquire “under whose guidance the decision” was taken. The issue came up in her political speeches as well. In Alipurduar’s Barobisha, she said: “They have changed good police officials but that will not affect us. If you can, replace me first.” The state government, however, issued “immediate” orders replacing the four officials.Outgoing Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma was posted as the additional director-general of police (operations); outgoing Bidhannagar Police commissioner Gyanwant Singh was made director, Directorate of Economic Offences; the two police superintendents replaced — Syam Singh and S Selvamurugan — were posted as commanding officers of State Armed Police (SAP) battalions.
