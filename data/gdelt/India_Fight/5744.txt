Brahmin Family Allegedly Blocks Wedding Procession of Dalit Groom in Uttar Pradesh

New Delhi: Members of a Brahmin family reportedly stalled the ceremonial wedding procession of baraatis (guests of the bridegroom) of a local girl from the Valmiki sub-caste in Mathura.

According to the Times of India, the incident took place on the night of February 10 – last Sunday – when a Jatav groom, Mahesh Kumar from Peergarhi tappa village, was taking out his wedding procession towards the bride’s home in Musmuna village. The bride’s family members were part of the procession and noticed a tractor-trolley blocking their way to the venue.

The bride’s uncle, Vijayendra Singh told the Times of India that the Brahmin family refused to remove the tractor-trolley when asked, and instead launched casteist slurs and even manhandled some of the family members.

The Brahmin family finally removed the tractor-trolley after the bride’s family members called the police. Despite that, Singh claimed that a few youths from the Brahmin family stopped the DJ from playing music. In order to salvage the situation, the baraatis decided to go to the bride’s house without the procession and music.

When the bride’s family went to the police station on Tuesday, a compromise was arrived at and the Brahmin family apologised.

There have been several reports of Dalit wedding processions being attacked or blockaded in the past.

Most recently, on Saturday, a Dalit policeman’s wedding procession was allegedly attacked by upper caste Rajput men in Dugar village of Rajasthan. The groom claimed the procession was attacked and he was verbally humiliated.

The groom Sawai Ram also alleged the assailants attacked the procession with sharp weapons after people tried to stop the Rajput men, resulting in injuries for many.

A case was registered against more than 12 people on Sunday and the matter is being investigated.
