Why is Kashmir disputed?

Changes in local leadership could dampen the sense of exclusion among Kashmiri Muslims and help to restore their faith in Indian democracy. This would entail genuine political representation and transparent and fair elections. However, if the BJP’s revocation of Article 370 — which required approval from J&K’s government — is anything to go by, then such political liberalization does not appear to be part of the ruling party’s modus operandi.
