Dance India Dance: Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karan Wahi’s latest pic from the show is too cute to be missed

Finally, Kareena Kapoor Khan made her television debut as a judge on the dance reality show Dance India Dance 7 and in the show, Bebo is seen judging the show alongside Raftaar and Bosco. From the first episode of the show, Kareena proved that besides grabbing eyeballs for her gorgeousness, she is an amazing judge. While Kareena is being shuttling between London and Mumbai to shoot for the show, in between, we had sister Karisma Kapoor and BFF Malaika Arora who filled in for Bebo as she couldn’t come from London.

Of late, Kareena has been living a very hectic life as she comes to Mumbai just for a day to shoot for Dance India Dance and a day later, she is snapped at the airport, leaving for London to be with hubby Saif Ali Khan and Taimur Ali Khan. And in the latest episode that Kareena shot for the show, this Chameli actress slays in a black pant suit and in one of the pictures clicked during the show, we can see the host of the show and TV actor Karan Wahi going down on his knees with a couple of heart-shaped balloons while Bebo is all smiles. Time and again, Karan Wahi has expressed his love for Bebo on the show and going by this picture, looks like, Karan’s dream has been fulfilled but it will be interesting to see if Bebo accepts the balloons or not.

On the work front, Kareena Kapoor Khan recently wrapped up the shooting of Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium opposite Irrfan and in the film, Bebo plays the role of a cop. Next, she will begin shooting for Karan Johar’s Takht co-starring Ranveer Singh, Vicky Kaushal, Janhvi Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and BHumi Pednekar. Also, Bebo will be seen sharing screen space with Aamir Khan in Lal Singh Chaddha.
