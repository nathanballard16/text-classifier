KABUL: Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar was finally declared a global terrorist by the UN Security Council on Wednesday

The UN Security Council Committee statement:On 1 May 2019, the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning ISIL (Da'esh), Al-Qaida, and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities approved the addition of the entry specified below to its ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List of individuals and entities subject to the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo set out in paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution 2368 (2017) and adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations."

Reacting to the development, India's permanent representative at the United Nations Syed Akbaruddin said that it is a significant success. 'The chairperson of the UN Sanctions Committee did confirm to me that Masood Azhar is on the UN-sanctioned list. The efforts began in 2009. With several efforts being put in, they have paid. It is a significant success. This is only the first step to counter terrorism. US, UK, France and many other countries came out in support of India's effort of putting Masood Azhar on sanctioned list. The goal was set out 10 years ago," he said.

In the aftermath ofFebruary 14, 2019, Pulwamaterror attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed, the US along with France and UK had moved a proposal to list Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. But on March 13, the last day for the listing of Azhar, China had put a technical hold on the proposal, citing that it needed more time to understand the issue around the man responsible for the death of hundreds of Indians in terror strikes.

Jaish-e-Mohammad had taken responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack, the deadliest on Indian security forces in the last 20 years.
