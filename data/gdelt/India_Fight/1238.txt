Bombay High Court rejects bail plea of Muslim youth’s murderer

Mumbai: In the latest setback to Hindu extremists, Mumbai High Court rejected bail plea of a Hindu extremist who was accused in the brutal killing of a Muslim man who was the resident of Nampur village near Malegaon. Intervening into the case on behalf of victim’s brother, Jamiat Ulama strongly opposed the plea. Thanks to the intervention of Jamiat Ulama, bail pleas of 3 accused have been rejected so far.

During the hearing, advocate Mateen Shaikh who was engaged by Jamiat Ulama told Justice Nitin Sambre that the plaintiff with the help of two accused had killed Waris Shaikh resident of Nampur village on January 24, 2018, resulting in tension in the area.

Advocate Mateen Shaikh told the court if the accused is released on bail, the situation in the area may become volatile. Besides, he will try to wipe off the evidence. Charges have already been framed in the lower court.

After listening to the arguments of both the parties, Justice Sambre rejected bail plea of the accused.
