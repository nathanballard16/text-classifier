Pulwama fallout: No takers for Delhi-Lahore bus service; DTC incurs losses

New Delhi: The strained relations between India and Pakistan following the terror attack in Pulwama has had its effect on the popular Delhi-Lahore bus service of DTC. Citing huge losses being incurred on its operation, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has requested the Centre to suspend the Delhi-Lahore bus service. The number of passengers travelling by the bus have drastically fallen since the February 14 terror attack at Pulwama. Hence DTC has requested that continuing the thrice a week service is posing a huge burden on its finances.

As reported by the India Times, the first bus from Lahore just after the February 14 attack came with a single passenger to Delhi. With many cancelling their bookings, the service is now operating with a handful of passengers.

An official of DTC revealed that the bus has a seating capacity of 40 passengers and it usually runs full or with at least 30 passengers on each trip. However, since February 14, the number of passengers has drastically fallen.
