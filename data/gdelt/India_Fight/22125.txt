Faridabad, April 24

The battlelines for the most populated Faridabad seat in Haryana is almost drawn. While the BJP’s Krishan Pal Gurjar will try to retain his seat for the second time, Congress’ Avtar Singh Bhadana will be attempting to register a win for the fourth time. The AAP-JJP and the BSP candidates are greenhorns, but with a capability to impact the result.

As the BJP and the Congress have betted on the same candidates who had battled in 2014 elections, the candidates fielded by other parties like the AAP-JJP, the BSP and the INLD are rather new. While Gurjar (62) will be trying for the second time, his main rival Bhadana (62) will be contesting the Lok Sabha elections from this seat for the fifth time. Bhadana had won from here in 1991, 2004 and 2009 elections. However, in 2014, he had lost to Gurjar.

Naveen Jaihind (38) of the AAP-JJP alliance is a greenhorn and is in the field for the first time. Mandhir Mann (43) of the BSP and Mahender Singh Chauhan of the INLD are also first-timers.

Though the picture is likely to be more clear after the withdrawal of nominations on April 26, political analysts say these elections could be a repeat of 2014 as the main two rivals (BJP and Congress) remain the same. “While the anti-incumbency factor faced by Bhadana in 2014 will now be a challenge for Gurjar, the pact between AAP and the JJP, both rising political forces, is sure to play an important role,” claims Ajaydeep Lathar, a political analyst. The BSP, which had a definite vote bank, was also a factor to reckon with, he said.

Seasoned vs first-timers
