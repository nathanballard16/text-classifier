Story 2: UNSC passes Resolution to combat terrorist financing



The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on March 28, 2019 unanimously passed the first-ever resolution to suppress the funding of terror groups worldwide.



Highlights of the Resolution



• The “Resolution 2462 on Countering the Financing of Terrorism” clearly states that all the member states shall make sure to establish laws and regulations that regard funding to terrorist groups or individual criminals a serious criminal offence.



• The resolution combines all the previous resolutions to create a consolidated document for strong collaboration and targeted efforts against terrorism.



• It also calls on members to create financial intelligence units.



• Member states that fail to implement the UNSC resolution would face UN sanctions.

Note The adoption comes at such a critical time when the recent terror attacks clearly demonstrate terror groups’ access to funding, be it legal or illegal. The latest example is the Pulwama terror attack wherein a suicide bomber killed an Indian army convoy of over 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14, 2019. At present, as per the FATF, two-thirds of Member States are not effectively taking legal action terrorist financing which includes construction, drug trafficking and even the trade of used cars.

Directions for UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT)



The resolution directs the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), set up in 2017, to implement global counter-terrorism strategy to play a leading role in identifying ways to suppress terrorist financing.



Vladimir Ivanovich Voronkov, Under-Secretary-General of UN Office of Counter-Terrorism identified three priority areas for the organisation to combat terrorism. These are:



• Expanding the focus of UNOCT to cover intelligence sharing, risk assessments and public-private partnerships



• System-wide awareness-raising and development of a comprehensive approach



• Work closely with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body which sets standards for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and related threats to the integrity of international finance system.
