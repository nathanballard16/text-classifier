With just days to go, hope dims for minority village

GUWAHATI: A minority-dominated village in Assam 's Kamrup district with a 95% enrolment rate in the draft NRC has gone from hope to despair after the last round of re-verification saw at least one member from every family summoned for hearings.Schoolteacher Khajal Uddin Ahmed said many among the 5,000-odd residents of No. 1 Malibari Pathar village were worried they might not make it to the final citizenship rolls that are scheduled to be published this Saturday. "Unlike other minority-dominated villages, the draft NRC released in July last year had good news for most of us in No. 1 Malibari Pathar. But our sense of relief has been short-lived. After the re-verification summons, we are suspicious of the process. What if someone is left out of the final NRC?" he said.While NRC applicants without proper land ownership documents found it difficult to back their residency claims during the re-verification hearings, the repeat scrutiny sowed doubt in the minds of even those who insist their papers are in order.Kamrup's Chamaria block, of which No. 1 Malibari Pathar is a part, was infamous for violent clashes between minorities and indigenous communities during the anti-foreigner movement from 1979 to 1985. The area seemed to have put its past behind after the Assam Accord was signed, but old anxieties have resurfaced in the run-up to the deadline for the final NRC.Hazrat Ali Ahmed, whose birthplace Bogoriguri is about 94km from Guwahati, said everyone in his family was included in the draft NRC, but his mother was summoned to a re-verification hearing at Kaliabor in Nagaon district last month."We are at a loss why she was called to the hearing. She is Indian, which is why she was included in the draft NRC in the first place, isn't it?" he said.
