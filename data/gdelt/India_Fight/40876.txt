PM Modi reveals how technology helped in 'fast conversation' with Bear Grylls in â€˜Man vs Wildâ€™

New Delhi:

In his third episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ after returning to power in May this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday revealed how technology helped in carrying out a fast conversation between him and TV host Bear Grylls in his jungle survival programme "Man Vs Wild" on Discovery channel. The prime minister chose to talk about it because people were asking him about how exactly the episode was shot.

“But there is another interesting thing, some people ask me one thing albeit with some hesitation -Modi ji, you were speaking in Hindi and Bear Grylls does not know Hindi, so how did you carry on such a fast conversation between the two of you? Was this episode edited later? How many times did the shooting happen for this episode and how it happened? They ask with great curiosity,” he said while addressing the nation through his monthly programme.

The prime minister said that he was speaking in Hindi during the live shooting but Bear Grylls heard it in English because of the use of technology.

“Now, there is no secret in this. Many people have this question in their minds, so I will unravel this secret. Well, in a way it is no secret at all! The reality is that technology was used extensively in my conversation with Bear Grylls. Whenever I spoke immediately there was a simultaneous translation into English or simultaneous interpretation and Bear Grylls had a small cordless instrument in his ear. So I used to speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology,” he said.

Emphasising that a large number of people have been discussing about Jim Corbett National Park after the "Man Vs Wild with Bear Grylls and Prime Minister Modi" went live, he urged people to visit sites associated with nature and wildlife and animals.

“You must also visit sites associated with nature and wildlife and animals. As I have said before, and I emphasize, that you must visit the north-east in your lifetime. What a glorious abundance of nature exists there. You will be left wonderstruck! Your horizon will expand,” the prime minister said.

“Our country is full of diversity and this wide range of diversity will also inculcate variations within you as a teacher. Your life will be enriched. Your thinking will expand. And trust me, there are places within India from where you will come back with renewed energy, enthusiasm, zeal and inspiration, and maybe you will feel like returning to certain places again and again; your family too would feel the same,” he added.
