Finally, PM Modi finds the courage to stand up to Donald Trump’s bullying tactics

The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has the wind in his sails after a massive electoral verdict. For over a year, the government led by Mr Modi held its fire in the face of extremely provocative statements by the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump. Mr Trump has been threatening to slap punitive tariffs on goods imported from India if New Delhi fails to adopt measures to improve market access for American products. Last week, however, Mr Modi hit back at the US for terminating duty-free imports of 1,784 items from India under the Generalized System of Preferences by imposing retaliatory tariffs on 28 American products, ranging from apples, almonds and walnuts to certain chemicals and finished metal products. India’s action is not really a big deal: it will impact imports of US goods worth only $241 million. This is just a smidgen when compared with the $33.1 billion worth of goods that India imported from the US in 2018. But the big surprise was that Mr Modi had finally found the courage to stand up to Mr Trump’s bullying tactics.

The big beef that Mr Trump has with India is over the size of the US deficit in merchandise goods trade that swelled to $21.3 billion in 2018. According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, India is the US’s ninth largest trading partner in goods with overall trade in the goods between the two countries put at $87.5 billion. Of this, India’s exports account for the lion’s share at $54.4 billion. Tariffs have proven to be Mr Trump’s cat-o’-nine-tails that he has waved menacingly at world leaders to force them to roll back what the US perceives to be unfair trading practices and bring about a semblance of balance in two-way trade.
