Article 370 Scrapped: Modi Govt Gets Unlikely Support From BSP & Kejriwal

We support the govt on its decisions on J & K. We hope this will bring peace and development in the state. — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) August 5, 2019

New Delhi: BJP ally Janata Dal (United) reproached the Modi government for deciding to repeal Article 370 of the Constitution which grants special status to J&K. JDU's Rajya Sabha MPs staged a walkout from the House expressing their disappointment. The BJP, however, received an unlikely support from Mayawati Bahujan Samaj Party on the scrapping of the contentious Act. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also extended his support on the government's decision on J&K. "We hope this will bring peace and development in the state,"he tweeted. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday moved a bill proposing bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories-Jammu and Kashmir division and Ladakh.
