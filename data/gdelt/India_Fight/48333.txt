WARANGAL: A 29-year-old army soldier, Hanmakonda Prem Kumar, was killed after he got involved in a fight during a friend’s birthday party at Narsampet in Warangal Rural district on Saturday night.

According to police, Prem Kumar, currently posted as an SSB constable in Srinagar, came home two days ago on a short vacation. He went to meet his friends on Saturday and they all went to watch a late night film. While in the middle of the movie, he was called by a friend Chiluveru Rakesh, asking him to join a friend’s birthday party. Prem Kumar decided to leave the show mid-way along with another friend R. Uday and reached Vallabh Nagar. When the two reached the party venue, there was a fight going on between Prem’s friend and another group. The army man tried to separate the fighting men but he too came under attack. One of the attackers stabbed him in the chest with the knife used to cut the cake.

Prem Kumar was rushed to a private hospital in Narsampet but after first aid, it was suggested that he be moved to MGM Hospital in Warangal. Doctors who attended on him at MGM, felt that he be shifted to Hyderabad for better treatment. But the soldier suffered severe loss of blood and died while on the way to a private hospital in Hyderabad during the early hours of Sunday.

Prem Kumar’s father Ramesh complained to the police that Dudimetla Dileep Yadav, Nagaraju and Bharath Reddy had attacked his son and killed him. The prime accused Dudimetla Dileep has been taken into custody and investigation is underway.

Police said preliminary investigation suggests that Dileep was in an inebriated state when he stabbed Prem Kumar.
