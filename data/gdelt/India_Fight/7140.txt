Pulwama Attack: Indian security forces detain 23 suspects

Pulwama :Indian security forces have detained 23 suspects who are expected to be members and sympathizers of Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, who have claimed responsibility for the attack.

The suicide attack killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel in south Kashmir's Pulwama, and is said to be the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in three decades of Kashmir's insurgency.

The attack has made matters worse in the Valley, with four more Indian soldiers losing their lives on Monday morning, while combating the terrorists.

India, along with other countries has warned Pakistan to stop supporting terrorist outfits like Jaish-e-Mohammad and other Islamist groups that operate from the country.

Islamabad denied all allegations and rejected accusations claiming its involvement in the Pulwama terror attack.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) questioned all the suspects in connection to Thursday's bombing by JeM terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar, who was a native of Kakapora village in Jammu and Kashmir.

"They are trying to reach out to the top commanders of Jaish-e-Mohammad, including its Kashmir Chief," said one of the police officers.
