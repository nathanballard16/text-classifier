Clash among Congress party workers; want replacement of AICC in-charge P. C. Chacko

Alleging P. C. Chacko of having misbehaved with him at the Congress office in the National Capital when he visited to greet him, party leader Rohit Manchanda said, “Under leadership of PC Chacko, the party has lost all the elections: the recent Lok Sabha polls and Assembly and civic body elections in 2015 and 2017. If Rahul Gandhi can think of resigning, why shouldn’t he do the same?”

A group of Congress leaders has demanded to replace PC Chacko, All India Congress Committee in-charge for party’s poor performance in Lok Sabha elections 2019 in the National Capital.

It was under PC Chacko’s leadership that the party was in talks for an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party but the discussion did not worked out and caused a delay in announcing names of party candidates in Delhi.

AICC in-charge has denied the allegations by Rohit Manchanda and said, “He may be some unimportant person, I do not know him much.”
