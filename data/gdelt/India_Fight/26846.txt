BSF again attempts to force Rohingyas into Bangladesh

BGB is on high alert

The Indian Border Security Force (BSF) has been trying to force 10 Rohingyas into Bangladesh at Kasba upazila’s Kajiatali border area in Brahmanbaria.

The Rohingya group has been in no man's land since Thursday morning.

Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) is on high alert.

Wishing to remain anonymous, an officer of Brahmanbaria BGB Battalion 60 told Dhaka Tribune that BSF is trying to push the Rohingyas into Bangladesh.

Currently, BSF and BGB battalions are holding meetings regarding the matter.

Earlier this year, in January, BSF tried pushing 31 Rohingya people into Bangladesh at the same border point.

In the first week of September 2017—when unprecedented atrocities against Rohingyas were being carried out in Rakhine by Myanmar security forces—Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Myanmar on a visit. The leader of the largest democracy in the world did not condemn the atrocities, which were described by the then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.

The Indian government initiated a move to deport members of the persecuted community, but India's Supreme Court halted the move. About 40,000 Rohingyas live in different parts of India.
