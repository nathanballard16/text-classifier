Over 70 years on, battle for Kashmir continues

NEW DELHI • Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have already fought two wars over Kashmir, a former princely state that both countries claim in full.

A long-running insurgency on the Indian side of the disputed territory is now threatening to trigger another conflict after a suicide bombing on Thursday killed 44 Indian soldiers.

Here are the reasons for the dispute between India and Pakistan:

CONTESTED TERRITORY

Kashmir has been hotly contested by both countries even before they won their independence from the British in August 1947.

As per the plan for the partition of India and Pakistan provided for by the Indian Independence Act, Kashmir was free to choose to accede to either country. But when the ruler of the state decided to go with India, a two-year war broke out in 1947. Nearly two decades later, another conflict began in 1965. In 1999, forces backed by the countries engaged in a brief but bitter conflict.

WHY IS THERE UNREST ON THE INDIAN SIDE?

Kashmir is the only Muslim-majority state in Hindu-majority India. Many in Kashmir do not want to be governed by India, calling for either independence or a union with Pakistan, an Islamic republic.
