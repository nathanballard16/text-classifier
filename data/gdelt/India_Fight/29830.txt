On the last day of the Rajasthan shoot of Mardaani 2, Rani Mukerji received a special gift from Babu Saini, an art director of the film who is also a painter in Jaipur. A source informed they've worked together on several films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. He is also a huge fan and showed his appreciation by making a portrait of hers.

"He painted her in her Mardaani 2 look, a film she is very proud of. She was overwhelmed and informed him she will put it up in her house. It also shows the kind of affection and appreciation and respect technicians and crew members have for Rani as a person and her body of work," added the source.
