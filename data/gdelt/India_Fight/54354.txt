A minor girl from Bangladesh, who was pushed into trafficking, has been reunited with her family after a year. The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) came to the aid of the minor girl.

“We have succeeded in our mission of reuniting a sexually abused minor girl of Bangladesh with her family,” said Mukesh Arya, CWC member.

Notably, the girl was found under suspicious circumstances on a street of Bhagat Nagar here on May 5 this year.

The police detained the 16-year-old girl. Later, she was identified as a Bangladeshi resident. The girl also disclosed she was a Class IX passout and was working in Dhaka when she had come in contact with a person named Sandeep of Delhi. Then the accused brought her to Delhi on the pretext of marrying her in November 2018. After a few days, he took her to the home of one Rahul Dada, alias Inderjeet, and his wife Khushi in Delhi and left her there, saying that they were his friends.

Rahul and Khushi pushed her into flesh trade and had also made an obscene video of her. After a few days, Rahul handed her over to Ajay and Mannu at Panipat. Ajay raped the minor girl. However, she had managed to flee and informed the police.

The police had registered a case against Sandeep, Ajay, Mannu, Rahul and Khushi under Sections 370-A, 376, 506 and 120-B of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act and arrested Rahul, Khushi, Ajay and Mannu.

The girl’s parents had lodged a missing complaint in Bangladesh, Arya said.

The CWC member said, “We wrote to the higher authorities but got no response. In the meanwhile, we approached Rozy Taba, NCPCR member in Delhi. She arranged our meeting with the Bangladesh High Commission. With the efforts of the NCPCR and STOP, an NGO of Tamil Nadu, we succeeded in sending the girl back to her country.”
