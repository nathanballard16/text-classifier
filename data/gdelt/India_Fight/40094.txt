In previous seasons, we've seen Sallu in the avatar of a pilot and a naughty neighbour and this time, we will see him as a station master, according to Mumbai Mirror. A source revealed to MM, "Seated in a cabin, shaking from the tremors of trains passing by, Salman is dressed as a station master, as he explains the concept of the new season, stressing on the fact that it will move at a faster pace, and adding his own quirky take to the proceedings."
