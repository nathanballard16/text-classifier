IAF airstrike: Imran Khan tries to mimic PM Modi, says Pakistan will choose time, place to hit back

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday his country would choose the time and place to respond to what he called "uncalled-for aggression" by India, but denied that New Delhi had struck Jaish-e-Mohammed on Pakistani soil.

Imran Khan was announcing decisions taken at a meeting of Pakistan's National Security Committee soon after India said it had conducted a pre-emptive strike on the terrorist group that killed 40 CRPF soldiers in a suicide bombing this month in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district.

Sources said 12 Mirage 2000 jets carried out the pre-dawn strike.

India had vowed to take revenge after the Pulwama bombing, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces had been allowed to decide the time and place for action against terrorists.

Imran Khan said those who attended the National Security Committee meeting in Pakistan concluded that "India has committed uncalled-for aggression to which Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing".

He asked his nation's armed forces and his compatriots to prepare for "all eventualities".

SENIOR JAISH COMMANDERS KILLED

Foreign Secretary VK Gokhale said earlier at a press conference on Tuesday that a large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, and senior commanders were eliminated by India's pre-emptive strike.

"Credible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country, and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose. In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary," Gokhale said.

As many as 25 top commanders were killed, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval told the Cabinet Committee on Security on Tuesday.
