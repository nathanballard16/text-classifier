Illegal coal trade sees a spurt

BOKARO: Illegal coal business is on the rise in Bokaro causing a huge loss to state exchequer.“Police officers who had better understanding of the smugglers have been transferred following directions from the Election Commission of India and the newly deployed police officers are finding it difficult to get to the bottom of the nexus. Even though police are conducting anti-coal smuggling drive, the illegal coal business is still flourishing in the area,” a police source said under the condition of anonymity.A police team headed by Bermo deputy superintendent of police R Ramkumar seized two trucks loaded with illegal coal while conducting a raid at an illegal coal depot at Bodiya Basti under Bermo Thermal police station. Three persons were arrested while other members of the team managed to flee from the spot. Police seized around 30 tonne of coal which were stolen and stocked by the coal thieves from the abandoned coal mines of Central Coalfield Limited (CCL).“We have formed a special task force jointly with administrative officials and are conducting raids to curb the economic crime,” Ramkumar said.Thousands of tonnes of coals, which are excavated illegally from forest lands, abandoned CCL mines of rural areas of Bokaro and Dhanbad, are being smuggled to West Bengal through the Chandankyari area of the district. Chandankyari is the last block of state which touches Purulia district of West Bengal.The coal mafias of both Jharkhand and West Bengal run this illegal trade jointly. “There are hundreds of people involved in this unlawful business starting from unlawful digging of coal to ferrying it outside the state,” said N Ansari a resident of Sutribeda of Chadankyari.
