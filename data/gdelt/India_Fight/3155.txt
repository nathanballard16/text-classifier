New Delhi: Air travel to and from Mumbai is about to become even expensive as Mumbai Airport runway will be closed for repair and maintenance from February 7 to March 30, 2019. As per Mumbai International Airport spokesperson, over 5,000 flights are expected to be cancelled or rescheduled.

Over 230 flights will be cancelled when the second runway will be closed. It may be noted that the second runway handles about 36 arrivals and departure every hour. The maintenance work will happen from 11 am to 5 pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from February 7 to March 30, 2019.

It may be noted that Mumbai Airport is one of the busiest airports in India. On average, there are 950 arrivals and departures per day. Although there are two runways here, they are either used to fly or run for one runway at a time since they intersect each other. With the 22-day long partial closure of runways, the administration has expressed their expectation that the airlines should use large body aeroplanes so that more passengers can be accommodated to travel.

Because of this maintenance shutdown, there is a possibility of ticket prices to and from Mumbai to shoot up. The prices of these tickets are expected to increase by about 70 to 80 per cent while the ticket prices for other places are also expected to increase by about 25 to 35 per cent. Worth mentioning here is that when Delhi airport runway was closed for maintenance last year, ticket prices witnessed an 80% hike which burned a hole in air travellers' pocket.
