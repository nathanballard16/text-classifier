Srinagar: Ahead of the final phase of polling for Anantnag Lok Sabha seat, terrorists shot dead BJP district vice president Ghulam Mohammed Mir in Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district late Saturday night.

Preliminary police investigation revealed that three militants came to his house in Nowgam Verinag area and asked for the keys for his car and while driving the vehicle away, they pumped bullets into Mir, who was popularly known as 'Atal' in the area.

Mir, 55, had recently contested in the assembly elections on a BJP ticket from Anantnag. The BJP leader whose condition was critical was taken to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

This is the second time when terrorists have targeted BJP/RSS leaders in the Valley. Last month, terrorists killed an RSS leader as well as his personal security officer after snatching his weapon in a hospital in Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar.

The local RSS leader was identified as Chandrakanta Sharma and as per the initial reports he had gone to the hospital for a routine checkup.

Last year in November, BJP state secretary Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet were gunned down by terrorists near their house when they were returning from their shop in Kishtwar.

Condemning the incident former J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti tweeted: “I strongly condemn the killing of @BJP4India leader Gul Muhammad Mir in Verinag, South Kashmir. My condolences to the bereaved family and prayers for the departed soul.”

Omar Abdullah also condemned the “dastardly act of violence” and tweeted: “Ghulam Mohd Mir, office bearer of the BJP in South Kashmir has been shot & killed in Nowgam, Verinag. I condemn this dastardly act of violence & pray for the soul of the departed, Allah Jannat naseeb karey.”

Mir’s security cover had been withdrawn by the government in February this year.
