Fire guts posh Delhi hotel, kills 17

A massive fire broke out at Hotel Arpit Palace in Delhi's Karol Bagh on Tuesday, killing 17 persons, including two foreigners, and injuring several others. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced Rs 5 lakh compensation to families of deceased, and ordered a magisterial inquiry into causes of the fire and possible violations.

According to chief fire officer of Delhi Fire Service, Atul Garg, they got a call at around 4.30 am, informing them of the incident, following which 25 fire tenders were rushed to the spot. "The fire started from the first floor and spread to the entire building. Wood paneling in corridors and stairwells fed the flames. Around 65 people were trapped inside. Around 20 persons were rushed to hospital, of whom 17 were declared dead. The fire is believed to have been caused by a short circuit, and most of the victims are believed to have been asleep when it happened," Garg said, adding that a woman and child jumped from the top floor to save their lives.

Sivanand Chand (43), a survivor, said, "It took firefighters about 30 minutes to reach my floor because fire engine ladders couldn't initially reach the fourth floor," he said.

Kejriwal, who visited the site, said the developer had a permit from the fire department to build four storeys but the building appeared to have six floors, including a basement and a kitchen built on top of the roof. "Carelessness on the part of authorities is evident. We are going to investigate, and wrongdoers will be punished. Compensation of Rs 5 lakh will be given to families of the deceased," he said.

A case under sections 304 and 308 of the IPC has been registered against the hotel's owner, Suvendu Goyal. Meanwhile, general manager Rajender and manager Vikas have been arrested. The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch.
