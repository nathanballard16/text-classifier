Pakistan to Decide Whether to Give Captured Indian Pilot Status of War Prisoner

The officials said that India is not asking for consular access but safe return. IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was detained by the Pakistan Army on Wednesday when, during an aerial engagement, his MiG 21 Bison was shot down by the Pakistani fighter planes.

Officials further added that Pakistan has informed foreign diplomats in Islamabad that India is going to launch missile strikes in an apparent attempt to create war psychosis.

"It is an attempt to create war psychosis. We are countering this war psychosis of Pakistan. India took no actions to escalate the situation on Wednesday. We would like credible, verifiable action against Jaish-e-Mohammed before India will respond to Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan offer of talks," the official stated.
