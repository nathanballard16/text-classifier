University of Mumbai teachers doubly burdened with assessments, poll duties

The University of Mumbai has rescheduled dates of 68 examinations clashing with elections. However, this means no respite for college teachers. They continue to do their exam supervision, electoral duties, and coordination and complete the answer sheet assessment work in order to avoid any delays in result declaration.

"The students are relieved that they have a couple of extra days to study and prepare for their exams but what about the teachers? Every day around 100 to 120 answer papers are being scanned and placed in our basket for assessment which we have to start within 24 hours of the examination. This is inhumane," said a teacher in a Churchgate-based college.

Since the past few years, assessment has become online and the teachers have to go to Centralised Assessment Process (CAP) centers located in colleges or nearby to assess the papers.

"There are times when we get answer papers not related to our course subjects but we have to do it since it has been put in our basket. On top of that, we are expected to do a variety of paperwork as a part of our election duty for free and that too along with the regular college chores, it's impossible to manage," said Shomit Salunke, assistant professor at Government Law College, Churchgate.

"Even on dates of election, we are expected to come and finish the assessment work," added another teacher. The exams in most city colleges will begin this week for all students across all streams.
