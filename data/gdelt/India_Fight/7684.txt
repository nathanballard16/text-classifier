Pakistani nationals asked to leave Bikaner

The Collector of Bikaner in Rajasthan has asked all Pakistani nationals to leave the district within 48 hours, citing intelligence reports that indicated “extreme unrest” among the locals after the Pulwama attack.

Collector Kumar Pal Gautam issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code on Monday, banning the stay of Pakistani nationals in any hotel, inn or hospital within the limits of the district and restricting any direct or indirect trade and exchange of classified information with any Pakistani national.

Bikaner is adjacent to the international border with Pakistan. Bahawalpur district in Pakistan’s Punjab province is situated on the other side of the border opposite Bikaner.

Khajuwala tehsil in Bikaner is home to a large number of Hindus, mainly from the interior areas of the Sindh province, who have sought refuge in India. Mr. Gautam said the district administration, which had recently undertaken a survey of citizens in the area, found that the Pakistanis were living there illegally after their visa expired.

The order will not be applicable to the Pakistani nationals who have registered themselves with the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office. The order, effective for two months, also bans the use of Pakistani SIM cards in the district.
