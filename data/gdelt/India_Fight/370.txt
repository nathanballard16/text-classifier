Well over 50 state-owned buses were damaged in incidents of violence, soon after two women Bindu and Kanakadurga entered the Sabarimala shrine to breach a tradition which kept menstruating women away from the shrine citing the ‘eternal celibate status’ of the deity.The BJP and its allies have intensified protests against the ruling LDF government following Wednesday's developments.The Congress-led UDF is observing a 'black day' today.
