Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday again raked up the issue of EVM tampering, demanding the return of ballot paper for elections. Mamata said that a fact-finding committee should be constituted to find out the details about EVM tampering.

"We have to save democracy. We don't want machines, we demand a return to the ballot paper system. We will start a movement and it will be initiated from Bengal," Mamata told reporters after a party meeting to review election preparedness.

Mamata cited the example of the US and said that even a powerful and developed country has banned the use of EVMs for elections. "I will ask all the 23 political parties in the opposition to come together and demand the return of ballot papers. Even a country like the US has banned EVMs," she said.

Meanwhile, the TMC and BJP are currently engaged in capturing and recapturing each other's party offices. Today, Mamata herself broke into a BJP office in Naihati area of North 24 Parganas district and painted name and symbol of TMC over the saffron walls.

The entire issue of 'capturing' and 'recapturing' party offices has come to fore after many TMC offices at block and village level across the state were found painted saffron. According to reports, the owners of the building have switched sides to join the BJP after the recently held Lok Sabha Election results where BJP won 18 of the 42 parliamentary constituencies.

And now TMC chief has asked her party workers to recapture all the offices from the BJP.

The issue of raising Jai Shri Ram slogan has also turned into a political one in the state with BJP supporters chanting the slogan from wherever West Bengal CM's convoy passes by and Mamata accusing the BJP of turning a religious slogan into a political one.
