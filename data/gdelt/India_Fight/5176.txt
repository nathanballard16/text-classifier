Ghaziabad: A woman and her illegitimate lover were arrested from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh on Friday for allegedly murdering the former's husband. Police nabbed the duo from Labour Chowk on Friday morning and booked them under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Going by reports, the accused were having an extramarital affair for the past year and wanted to live together. The wife, Razia, allegedly gave her husband Israz Ahmad sleeping pills as her paramour, Salim Ahmad visited her at the couple's residence in Ghaziabad's Khoda area. On December 26 of last year, police found the husband's body at the couple's residence.

An investigation into the matter revealed that the victim did not die of natural causes as claimed by his wife. An autopsy report confirmed that Israz Ahmad was strangulated to death prompting the police to suspect his wife Razia of foul play.

Following their arrest, the couple confessed to the murder and told police officials that Razia gave the victim more sleeping pills than usual on the day of his death. She then called Salim who came to their residence and strangulated Israz. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Indirapuram, Ravi Kumar said that they tied a dupatta to his neck and pulled it from either end after the victim lost consciousness. As a result of the police investigation, an FIR was registered and both accused booked for murder under relevant sections of the IPC.
