Islamabad, March 27

Pakistan today sought “more information/evidence” from India on the involvement of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in the deadly Pulwama terror attack and the presence of camps of the UN-proscribed terror outfit in the country.

Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria was called by Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua and the “preliminary findings” were shared with him, the Foreign Office said, referring to the deadly terror attack as an “incident”.

The preliminary findings were shared with India after examining the Indian dossier, it said.

India had handed over the dossier to the Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan in New Delhi on February 27 with specific details of JeM’s complicity in the Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel on February 14 and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan.

Stating that Prime Minister Imran Khan had offered cooperation in the investigation if “credible evidence” was provided by India, the FO said, “In response, a paper was handed over to Pakistan.” Pakistan has acted with a high sense of responsibility and extended full cooperation, it claimed. “We do so in the interest of regional peace and security,” the FO added. — PTI
