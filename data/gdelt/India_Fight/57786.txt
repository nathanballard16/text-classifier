Pune, Dec 26 : Two Indian Army soldiers were killed and at least five others injured during a freak bridging exercise at the prestigious College of Military Engineering (CME) Pune on Thursday afternoon, official sources said.

During a training session for construction of a bridge, the tower support collapsed, crushing and trapping six-seven soldiers in the incident, said an official statement.

They were rushed to the Military Hospital, Kirkee, where Lance Havilkar Sanjivan P.K. and Naik B.K. Waghmode succumbed during treatment.
