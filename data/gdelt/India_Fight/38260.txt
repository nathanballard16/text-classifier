Op-Ed: National Register of Citizens

The Act, while providing for “persons covered by the Assam Accord” in Section 6A, makes special provisions for persons who have entered the territory from outside India. Therefore, the first part of the burden of proof is the positive burden on the State to prove that a person has entered from outside India in the specified period. In the absence of such prima facie proof, the Citizenship Act applies as it does to the rest of India. The application of Section 6A does not take away from the substantive rights conferred by Section 3, since the two provisions are not exclusive. Thereby, legally there can be no assumption against citizenship, and the changing documentary requirements for proof for people from one specific state. Would not excluding the application of Section 3 for the people of Assam, in the absence of any constitutional provision, constitute discrimination based on the place of birth?
