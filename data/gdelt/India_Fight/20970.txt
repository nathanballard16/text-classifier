Kolkata: The convoy of Mohammed Salim, Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate from West Bengal’s Raiganj, came under attack on Thursday as voting progressed in the state in the second phase of Lok Sabha Elections.

Reports said the Left leader’s convoy was attacked by unidentified men in Islampur. It was reported that bullets were allegedly fired at his convoy. Bricks and stones were also hurled at the cavalcade.

Following the attack, the CPI(M) leader was taken to the party office and is reported to be safe.

Following the incident, the Election Commission has sought a report from the state administration.

Salim is the sitting Member of Parliament from Raiganj. This was one of the two seats that the Left party had won in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections.

Meanwhile, BJP general secretary and candidate from Raiganj constituency, Debasree Chaudhuri, alleged that workers belonging to the ruling Trinamool Congress were attempting booth capturing at Raiganj Coronation High School.

"TMC workers were trying to capture booth. They were campaigning among Muslims there. This isn't election campaign,” Chaudhuri alleged, as per ANI.
