SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Three militants were killed Thursday in a fierce gunfight with government forces in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said.

The gunfight between militants and government forces broke out in Yarwan forest area of Keller in Shopian district, about 65 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Three militants were killed early today in a gunfight inside forest area of Yarwan in Keller with joint contingents of army and police," an Indian army spokesperson said. "The identity of slain militants is being ascertained."

Police officials said the operation was underway in the area.

Meanwhile, another gunfight broke out in Handwara of Kupwara district, northwest of Srinagar.

"Exchange of fire between militants and joint contingents of police and army is going on at Yaroo area in Handwara," a police official said. "Further details are awaited."

Last week, eight militants were killed in four different gunfights across the region.

A guerrilla war is going on between militants and Indian troopers stationed in the region since 1989.

Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.
