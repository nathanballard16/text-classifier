Gujarat: Man held for ‘killing’ wife, suspecting she was in an affair

A 32-year-old man was arrested by the Halol police on Tuesday for allegedly murdering his wife, over suspicion that she was having an extramarital affair, the police said. The accused, Govindbhai Nayak lived with his wife Shanta Nayak (30) and 10-year-old son in Gharansarvav village of Halol taluka of Panchmahals district.

Nayak was suspicious of his wife having an affair with a man who was living in their house for the past two days and was a guest from the neighbouring village.

According to police, on Monday evening, Nayak had seen the two talking in the kitchen and confronted them. While the man fled from the house, an argument ensued between Nayak and his wife. As the argument heated up, Nayak, in a fit of rage hit her on her head with a stick and continued until she was rendered motionless, police said.

His wife had sustained grievous injuries on her head, hands and legs, police said. Nayak, however, waited until the next morning when he went to the village sarpanch and confessed to have committed the crime. When the villagers reached his home, Nayak’s wife was already dead. The sarpanch of the village then informed the police.

His 10-year-old son who had witnessed the entire incident, narrated it to the sarpanch who informed the police and filed an FIR. Nayak was booked under IPC sections 302 (Murder) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).
