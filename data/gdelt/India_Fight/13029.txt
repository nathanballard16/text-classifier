A.P. man kills lover, burns body for ‘not divulging marital status’

Victim was reportedly pressuring accused to marry her

A 25-year-old man was arrested by the Nuzvid Rural police on charges of murdering his lover and setting her body on fire.

Police said the accused killed the victim after coming to know that she was already married once and was a mother to a child from that marriage.

Kamala (28), hailed from Bhadradri district in Telangana and worked as a maid in Hyderabad. She had divorced her husband.

The accused, who hails from Nuzvid, worked at a private company in Hyderabad.

According to the accused’s statement to police, he met Kamala on the social media six months ago and struck up a relationship. Kamala reportedly told the accused she was single, and she worked as a software engineer. The couple soon began a live-in relationship. However, the accused came to know of Kamala’s past.

“The accused hatched a plan to eliminate her, reportedly after she threatened him that she would go to the police if he refused to marry her. He then convinced her to visit his native place where he killed her,” police sources said.

According to police sources, Kamala’s half-burnt body was found by the roadside at Mittguda village under Nuzvid rural police limits on March 1. The accused reportedly set the body on fire after dousing it in petrol. However, police are yet to ascertain how he killed her first.
