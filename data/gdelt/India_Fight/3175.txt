New Delhi: Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has termed the CBI raids against his “political vendetta” and said he has complete faith in the judiciary. Talking to reporters Hooda vowed to fight this battle and said no one can silence his voice. The CBI on Friday registered a fresh case against the former Haryana CM and several others in connection with the alleged irregularities in allotting over 1,417 acres of land during 2009-12 in Gurugram.

Raids were also carried out at over 20 places in Haryana, Delhi and Punjab including Hooda’s residence in Rohtak. Reacting to the raids Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “Officials must hear this. Governments do not have any permanency. There are few weeks left for the general elections to begin. It is certain this government is rattled. Prime Minister is staring at an imminent defeat, that’s why these actions.”

He further said that once the new government resumes office, all such actions which have been at the behest of the political masters of today to harass, intimidate, frame and defame, even the charges, they will be held to account and they will have to answer.

The CBI had recently received approval from the governor to file a charge sheet against Hooda in connection with the case.

The former Chief Minister is in the dock for allegedly using his influence to allot a plot for Associated Journal Limited (AJL), the parent company of the National Herald newspaper, reported news agency IANS.

Hooda was supposed to address a campaign rally in support of Randeep Singh Surjewala in Haryana’s Jind.
