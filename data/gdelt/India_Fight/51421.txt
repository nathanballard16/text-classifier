Later, he called his friend Nikhil and they hit me with a helmet on my head. My brother came out after some time and the two men beat him up as well. I lost my gold chain in the fight," Bhushan stated.

He also alleged that the men were accompanied by a woman who pushed him. While in his complainant Amit has alleged that his bike was stuck because Bhushan parked his car outside the shop.

"I came with my family to the market and was trying to start my bike when a man parked his car right near the exit. I told him to move his car so that I could take my bike out but the man slapped me and started beating me up. My brother and mother came to stop the fight but the man thrashed them too," according to his complaint, police said.
