Gay partner arrested for murder

Ludhiana: More than two weeks after a man was found murdered, police on Friday claimed to have solved the case with the arrest of his gay partner.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said, “During interrogation, the accused — a labourer — confessed to have killed his 50-year-old partner following a fight over ending their relationship. He revealed that he strangulated his partner — also a labourer — with a handkerchief in an inebriated condition on September 29, after both of them had drinks. He then dumped his body in fields.”

Police had found the body near Gill bypass of Dehlon on October 1.

As there were no visible injury marks on the body, police had initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC.

But after the post-mortem report suggested that man was strangulated, the police registered a murder case. More than a week later, his son had identified the body.

With the investigation pointing the needle of suspicion towards his partner, the police picked him up for questioning.

“The accused and his partner were in a relationship for the past over a year. The accused did not want to continue with this relationship. When he told his partner that he wanted to end their relationship, the latter threatened to lodge a sodomy case against him. The accused then decided to kill him,” the cop added.
