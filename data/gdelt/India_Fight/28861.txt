Trainee cops block road to protest voyeurs at barracks

Varanasi: Over 300 trainee women constables blocked Pandeypur Road near Police Lines here on Wednesday, accusing a group of unidentified youths of breaking into the campus and trying to film them bathing.The protesters demanded that the height of the boundary wall be raised, the barracks properly illuminated and security beefed up.While SSP Anand Kulkarni has formed a team of three circle officers to probe into the allegations, he has also warned the trainees against taking to street protests without raising such issues at a proper forum.The 347 trainee constables blocked the road and staged a sit-in on Wednesday morning after some youths allegedly sneaked into the barracks on Tuesday night with the intention of filming them in the open-air bath chambers. Cantonment circle officer Anil Kumar rushed to the spot and quelled the protest with the promise to investigate the complaint. The SSP formed a probe team that included Chetganj CO Ankita Singh and Dashashwamedh CO Priti Tripathi, besides Cantonment CO Kumar . Apparently, no trainee could clearly tell the officers who saw the voyeurs on Tuesday night. The team also inspected the bathing area.Speaking to TOI on Thursday, SSP Kulkarni played down the incident. He claimed filming anyone was not possible from outside the bath chambers.“The new batch of trainees has come from Allahabad on June 3. Although making unwanted videos is not possible here, a team is still probing the complaint. In the meantime, trainees have been warned against indulging in street protests and indiscipline,” the SSP said.
