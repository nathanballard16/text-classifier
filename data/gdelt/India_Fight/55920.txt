Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh police chief OP Singh on Monday said the Aligarh Muslim University campus would be evacuated on Monday and all students would be sent home, reported NDTV.

"We are evacuating AMU today, we will send all students home," UP Director General of Police OP Singh said. "We have received no reports of any vandalism by the police," he said.

Singh said around 15 students have been arrested and the police would identify and act against everyone who indulged in violence.

Internet has been blocked in the city and the university closed till January 5.
