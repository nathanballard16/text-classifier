Rajinikanth’s Darbar shoot stopped – here’s why

It’s a known fact that Rajinikanth’s fan-following is not only limited to regional audiences, but extends globally too. But it’s also equally well-known that crazy fandom has its drawbacks as well, especially if the fans start crossing their limits and going to extremes to grab attention from their favourite stars. The Darbar actor recently faced one such situation where even his film’s shoot had to be stalled because of his crazed fans.

Going by reports, the film which was being shot in a Mumbai suburban college had visitors that created a problem. The team along with director AR Murugadoss and female lead Nayanthara were shooting in an enclosed set yesterday. The fans were asked not to click any pictures or take any videos from the sets. This agitated the fans and to rebel against this strict rule, the students pelted stones at the set from the terrace of the building. This became a huge problem and the shoot had to be stopped immediately. Murugadoss was even compelled to shift locations and is now looking for a new location to shoot.

Apart from South star Rajinikanth and Nayanthara, the film also features Prateik Babar in a negative role. The film is a cop drama and the team started its shoot in Mumbai on April 22. Stay tuned to CineBlitz for more such updates from the world of Bollywood.
