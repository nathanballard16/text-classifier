Ranbir Kapoor, Vaani Kapoor head to Ladakh

After filming portions of the upcoming period drama, Shamshera, in Mumbai, its makers are now set to shoot their next schedule in Ladakh, which is known for its scenic beauty. Incidentally, this will be the first movie to be shot in the picturesque land of high passes after it became a Union Territory.

“Shamshera will have the most breathtaking visual experience that cine-goers have seen on screen. Director Karan Malhotra wanted to shoot some of the most crucial portions in Ladakh because it would add to the visual appeal of the film. Ranbir Kapoor and Vaani Kapoor left Mumbai a couple of days ago and will start shooting for the film today,” says an informer close to the project.

The action-adventure flick based in the 1800s is about a dacoit tribe fighting for its rights and independence from Britishers. While Ranbir plays the lead role, Sanjay Dutt essays his nemesis. Vaani will be seen as an exquisitely desirable and sought-after travelling performer. The Ladakh schedule, we have learnt, will only have portions of Ranbir and Vaani and will last for 10-odd days.

“Details of this schedule are known only to the crew that’s filming this portion in Ladakh. Since the movie is looking to transport viewers back to a period, huge sets have been built to recreate an era where Ranbir is pitted against Sanjay Dutt,” the source adds.
