Karnataka floor test HIGHLIGHTS: Monday will be last day for Kumaraswamy govt, says BS Yeddyurappa

Karnataka floor test: The political crisis in Karnataka continued to remain in limbo as Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar adjourned the House till Monday. The trust vote failed to take place for the second day in a row, despite a lengthy debate on the no-confidence motion in the Karnataka Assembly. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, who missed two deadlines set by the governor to prove majority in the House, has moved the Supreme Court against its July 17 order that the 15 rebel MLAs can’t be compelled to attend Assembly proceedings.

State Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao also moved the apex court against its July 17 order. Speaker K R Ramesh, on the other hand, lashed out at the legislators today for accusing him of delaying the trust vote process and indulging in “character assassination”. “You may have your own apprehensions but let me make it clear… I have led fairly in public life. Character assassination is easy but those commenting on me please look at your background,” he said.

The ruling JD(S)-Congress government remained on edge ever since 16 MLAs — 13 from the Congress and three from JDS — had resigned, while independent MLAs R Shankar and H Nagesh have withdrawn their support to the coalition government. The ruling coalition strength is 117— Congress 78, JD(S) 37, BSP 1, and nominated 1, besides the Speaker. With the support of the two independents, the Opposition BJP has 107 MLAs in the 225-member House. If the resignations of the 15 MLAs — 12 from Congress and 3 from JD(S) — are accepted, the ruling coalition’s tally will come down to 101 (excluding the Speaker), reducing the 14 month-old Kumaraswamy government to a minority.
