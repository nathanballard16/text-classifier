According to reports, Anushka will be playing the lead role in Ponniyin Selvan.

As per sources, Anushka had initially turned down the offer but, when she was re-approached, she agreed to go ahead with the movie. Anushka will play the role of Poonguzhali in this magnum opus. The stellar star cast includes Amitabh Bachchan, Vikram, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Vijay Sethupathi, Jayam Ravi and Keerthi Suresh. Musical genius AR Rahman will be composing the score for the film.

Previously, South diva Nayanthara was approached to play the lead role but turned it down as she didn’t have available dates after signing a sports drama with Vijay and also Rajnikanth’s next, Darbar.
