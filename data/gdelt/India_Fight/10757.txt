India and Pakistan headed to war? Analysts say the situation is fluid

NEW DELHI - The last time tensions between India and Pakistan peaked in 2001, the two countries managed to step back from war. And while analysts say that could still happen this time, the situation could just as easily spiral out of control.

Former Indian foreign secretary Lalit Mansingh said that this was the biggest outbreak of hostilities between India and Pakistan after the Parliament attack 18 years ago in which 14 people including five terrorists were killed in an attack on the Parliament of India.
