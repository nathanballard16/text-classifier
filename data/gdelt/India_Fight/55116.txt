THE STATE government on Wednesday set up a four-member committee headed by the additional finance secretary to examine if the Metro car shed in Aarey can be shifted to an alternate site that is both environment and pocket-friendly. A report in this regard has to be submitted to the government within 15 days.

The four members are additional chief secretory (Finance), principle secretory (Environment), MD of Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation and the chief forest conservator of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali).

A government resolution issued in this regard on Wednesday said the committee will check if alternate site, which will also have to environment-friendly and of reasonable cost, is available; whether appropriate procedures were followed while felling 2,100 trees at Aarey and what measures need to be taken to protect Aarey Colony from environmental damage.

While stopping construction of the Metro car shed soon after assuming charge, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had clarified that he had not stayed the work of the Metro Rail project itself.
