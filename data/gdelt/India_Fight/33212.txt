59 Internet Shutdowns in India Already, & It’s Just Been 6 Months!

Overall, between January 2012-19, there have been a total of 331 shutdowns in India, according to the official data available.

Shutdowns have, in fact, been on the rise, with 2014 seeing just six as opposed to 79 in 2017. And it’s happening again now.

According to Medianama, the actual number could be much higher, with shutdowns being ordered quietly by governments and not always being mentioned in the media.
