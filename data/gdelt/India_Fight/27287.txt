A mob vandalised Bangalore’s Alliance University alleging that one of its students ran over a 30-year-old man near Avadadhenahalli bus stop in the city outskirts. The incident came to light nearly a week after it had happened on May 22.

A Mercedes-Benz car, purportedly driven by Rajesh, a student of Alliance University, ran over Munraju while he was crossing the road on his bike. Munraju was rushed to the nearest hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. Bangalore City Police registered a case against Rajesh after he was caught and thrashed by passers-by.

Meanwhile, the news of the accident, which happened on May 21, spread in Munraju’s village. The next day, angry locals barged into the university premises and vandalised a security cabin and some offices. Cars parked inside the university campus were also damaged by the mob.

In the complaint to the local police accessed by Indianexpress.com, Manivannan, a security guard from the university said, “Around 60-80 members mob from the nearby village entered inside the university campus and smashed the cars parked in the campus, vandalised the security office and also threatened the students in the campus.”
