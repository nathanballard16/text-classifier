Nagpur tiger to get artificial limb, undergoes first successful surgery

NAGPUR: Nine-year-old Sahebrao, a male tiger at the city’s Gorewada Rescue Centre, has inched closer to getting an artificial limb, on Wednesday. If successful, this will be the world’s first prosthesis for a tiger.A prosthesis is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may have been lost through trauma, disease, or congenital conditions. Prosthetics are intended to restore normal functions of the missing body part.TOI was, on February 3, 2018, the first to report that an artificial limb may be fitted to Sahebrao. On Wednesday, a 40-minute surgery was performed on Sahebrao by a team of vets from Wildlife Research & Training Centre (WRTC) led by its director Dr Shirish Upadhye, Goutam Bhojne, and Dr Vinod Dhoot.Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sushrut Babhulkar, Dr Peter Giannoudis from University of Leeds, United Kingdom; Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) managing director N Rambabu, PCCF (wildlife) NH Kakodkar, divisional manager Nandkishor Kale and others were also present.In 2012, Sahebrao was injured after being caught in a trap laid by poachers in the forest near Gondmohadi ( Chandrapur ). It was treated by Dr NP Dakshinkar, Dr Upadhye, Dr Dhoot and Dr Bhojne for renal failure and also for gangrene, which resulted in sloughing off of its toes.For the last six years, Sahebrao has been limping. The pain aggravated in the last few months so much so that it used to cry out with every step it put forward.“We operated upon Sahebrao for neuroma on Wednesday, and took measurement for a prosthesis, which will be fitted after 6 weeks, the time taken to recover from this surgery,” said Dr Upadhye.Dr Babhulkar, who adopted Sahebrao last year, said, “The surgery will give 99% pain relief to the tiger, and fitting artificial limb is the next step.”Dr Babhulkar had decided to fit an artificial limb to Sahebrao in February last. Accordingly, radiographic studies were carried out at Gorewada by a team of veterinarians in February.Sahebrao was tranquillized on Wednesday and operated upon for neuroma and arthritis, which were causing the pain. Necessary measurements and radiographs were also taken of the anatomical features to help design the prosthesis.Sources said plans are afoot to procure the artificial limb after discussions with experts from IIT Mumbai, and AO Foundation , Germany, which has expertise in fracture fixation of humans and animals.
