Apart from this, the court further directed Negi to join the investigation as and when required by the investigating agency and he will not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer.

The court also directed that he will not leave India without the prior permission of the court and deposit his passport with the CBI.

The court had directed the CBI to constitute a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by a Superintendent of Police to investigate the rape and murder of a 16-year old girl from Kotkhai.
