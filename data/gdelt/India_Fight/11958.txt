But when he has a hankering for Pakistani grub, he walks across the street to equally as famous Lahore Tikka House at 1365 Gerrard St E. “The food there is very good and so are the people,” said Sukhi. These legendary restaurants are a shining example of how the India/Pakistan relationship can be. “My late husband Alnoor always said staff and customers should keep the politics out of the restaurant,” said Gulshan Allibhai, owner of Lahore Tikka House. “We have done that from the beginning and we still do that.”

Muhammed Nasir Baig is and from Lahore, Pakistan. Rafik Patel from central India. Cook Vinay Nair is from Delhi India. “We are all best of friends,” said Nair. “Nothing that happens over there will affect our friendships and working relationships.” Said Baig: “It’s just politicians who focus on the issue. The people don’t — here or there. We do not let anything influence our situation here.” That said, it does not mean these tensions or divisions are immune to Toronto. We saw that first hand here at PostMedia Place last Sunday — since our building is also home to the India Consulate.

Article content One side of the front doors at 365 Bloor St. E. were about 30 pro-Pakistan demonstrators who showed up to protest India in the ongoing battle over Kashmir. On the other side of those same front doors were about the same number of protestors standing up for India against Pakistan’s aggressions in the controversial matter. You could hear the yelling and chanting from six floors up and three streets away. It went on for hours but despite the emotion, not one punch thrown or projectile lobbed. In fact, if someone from one side or the other decided it was time to go and they needed to go through the other side’s protest line, the seas would part and full accommodation was given. The political lines were drawn but it didn’t rise to violence. Toronto Police were impressive too. Respect to both sides.

In fact, with photographer Ernest Doroszuk, I went out to Pearson airport to meet people who were on Air Canada flight 042 to Delhi, which was turned around and brought back to Toronto for safety reasons. Even those people didn’t seem to harbour ill feelings. Back on Gerrard St., Pakistani-born Parveen Zahid said in her time in Canada she has found no problems. The area she is walking is nicknamed Little India but she said whether one is from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Africa, everybody feels it’s their place.

Inder Jandoo, who along with his wife owns Sonu Saree Palace at 1420 Gerrard St. E., has taken that same philosophy for 40 year. “We have staff from every country in the region and everybody loves each other,” he said. His wife Bhupinder told us that women from every country come into her shop for Saree’s and they all feel the warmth that they should. “We are seeing more mixed marriages now as well which means we are fitting Sarees into different backgrounds and it’s all positive,” she said. Iman Ahmad is her right hand manager and from Pakistan. “I have been here for 15 years and they have never looked at me as if I am from Pakistan but as a member of the family,” she said. “I feel the same way.” Khan and Modi should visit Gerrard Street. jwarmington@postmedia.com
