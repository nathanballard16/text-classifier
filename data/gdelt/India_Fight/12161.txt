Is Masood Azhar dead? Speculation rife over JeM chief's whereabouts

India carried out air strikes against the biggest training camp of JeM in Pakistan's Balakot. In the operation, at least 350 JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for suicide attacks were eliminated.

NEW DELHI: Days after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar is "unwell", several unconfirmed reports on Sunday claimed the dreaded terrorist is dead. Intense speculation made the rounds about Masood Azhar's whereabouts with a report of him getting killed in the bombardment by Indian Air Force (IAF) on a terror camp in Balakot going viral, but there was no confirmation from any authoritative sources. Amid growing pressure to show the damage caused by IAF's precision bombing on the Jaish-e-Mohammed training facility, India is contemplating releasing evidence in the days to come to silence those doubting the impact. The IAF had declared that disclosing proof of the air strike impact was a call to be taken by the government even though electronic evidence gathered by radar images was sufficient to establish the damage caused to the structures.
