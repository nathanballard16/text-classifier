Hindu Mahasabha cries terror in Kamlesh Tewari murder

LUCKNOW: Refusing to buy UP police theory that murderers of Hindu Samaj Party president Kamlesh Tewari were known to him, Hindu Mahasabha said the former member of their organisation was killed by terrorists. Speaking to TOI, Hindu Mahasabha president Vratadhar Ramanuj Jeeyar Swami Tridandiji, said, “If the government was not investigating into the terror angle, he would call up chief minister Yogi Adityanath and speak to him.” “Tewari was on the terror hit list and we are sure he was killed by terrorists. He left the Hindu Mahasabha a while back so we were not in touch, but because he was a Hindu leader, we support him. We refuse to believe there is any personal enmity behind this brutal killing,” Swami Tridandiji said.He said, the UP president of the Hindu Mahasabha had been asked to reach Lucknow from Gorakhpur on Saturday and immediately report on what action the UP government was taking.BJP MP Sadhvi Pragya Thakur tweeted that Tewari’s death would not go in vain. “The brutal murder of Kamlesh Tewari is a blow for the country, faith and Hindutva . As one who walked the line of duty for the country and dharma, his sacrifice will not go in vain,” she tweeted.VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma told TOI that Tewari’s murderers were wearing saffron , as seen in CCTV footage, it raised suspicion on the identity of the killers. “The government should ensure all angles are probed,” he said. BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla added 10 teams had been formed to probe murder and it was too early to comment on what transpired. “In 2015, Tewari had made a communal speech and a Maulvi in Bijore had issued a fatwa against him. We are not saying this could be the reason for his murder, but the government should explore all angles,” he said.
