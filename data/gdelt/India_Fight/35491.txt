12 Heartbreaking Images Of Helpless Animals In The Flooded Kaziranga Park In Assam

The north-eastern provinces of India are blessed with immense natural beauty, full of unique flora and fauna. But under the relentless assault of monsoon rain this year, one of Assam's most visited tourist destinations is turning into a watery graveyard of animals.

It's not just humans who have been affected in Assam, the plight of animals fighting the crisis is just heartbreaking. Assam is battling the monsoon as the flood in the state has worsened, with incessant rain swelling already raging rivers.

Several villages have been inundated and especially the Kaziranga wildlife reserve is severely flooded, with several animals trying to find a way out of it.

Here some chilling images of innocent animals getting displaced by the flood in Assam this year.
