A huge gang selling milk made with shampoo & paint busted

After a recent revelation by the Delhi Food Safety Department that most milk products in the state are sub-standard, a recent raid in the state of Madhya Pradesh has proved, that the use of packaged dairy products can be really dangerous. Madhya Pradesh police recently arrested a gang of 62 people who were involved in manufacturing and selling of synthetic milk and other dairy products. The Special Task Force (STF) raided factories based at Ambah in Morena district and Lahar in Bhind district of the Gwalior-Chambal region and what they found was really devastating.
