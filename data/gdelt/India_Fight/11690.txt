An Early Start The author was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital just outside Bristol as Joanne Rowling.



Joanne wrote her first novel about a rabbit, titled 'Rabbit', at the young age of six.



For the 'Harry Potter' series, she used the acronym JK (even though she doesn't have a middle name) at her publisher’s request, who thought a book by a female author might not work. She chose the 'K' for Kathleen, her paternal grandmother.

Expecto Patronum! A pioneer for mental health awareness, Rowling has openly spoken about her own battle with depression as a young, single mother, and about contemplating suicide.



Her biggest fear is losing a loved one. Rowling has spoken about regretting not getting a chance to tell her mother about the 'Harry Potter' series, which she started writing six months before her death.

Building A Brighter Tomorrow The author is known for her charitable work. She created the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000 to help children and women in Scotland. She has also contributed generously towards multiple sclerosis research.



She even lost her billionaire status once and was removed from Forbes' list of the World's Billionaires for donating around $160 million to charity.
