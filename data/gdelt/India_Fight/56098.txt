When North Karnataka farmer met his Huliya

Bengaluru: It was a dream come true for farmer, Pirappa Kattimani from North Karnataka when he met his idol, former CM Siddaramaiah, here on Monday.

The farmer, who shot to fame for shouting “Houdu Huliya” (Yes, God!) at intervals to show his approval during the Congress leader's speech at a recent bypoll rally in Raichur, did not eat for two days when he heard that his “Huliya” was in hospital with a heart problem. On hearing of his eagerness to meet him, a Kannada TV channel arranged for him to come to Bengaluru and even deputed one of its reporters to escort him to “Cauvery,” the official residence of the leader of the opposition where Mr Siddaramaiah has been recuperating since being discharged from hospital on Sunday.

Taken to the room where the Congress leader was meeting people, Pirappa fell at his feet and enquired about his health. In turn, Mr Siddaramaiah presented him with a silk shawl and asked him jokingly why he had joined the BJP (in reference to his frequent disruption of his speech at the Raichur rally). Taken aback, Pirappa replied in all innocence, “I haven't quit the Congress or joined the BJP.” Mr Siddaramaiah later posed for a picture with his fan and the farmer invited him to attend a festival in his village. Clearly touched, the Congress leader shared his picture with him on social media, thanking him for all his love and affection.
