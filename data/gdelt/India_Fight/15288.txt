Is BJP-Ruled Tripura Seeing Development Minus Democracy?

Not only this, but 96% of the rural body seats were won by the BJP unopposed. The nomination process for the by-elections saw clashes between the supporters of the BJP and the opposition. The BJP supporters also clashed with supporters of ally IPFT, with the latter, too, joining the opposition CPM and Congress to defer the deadline of the nomination process. This demand was declined by the State Election Commission.
