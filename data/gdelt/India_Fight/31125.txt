Yellow-footed Green Pigeon(with chicks)

Description:

Ashy olive-green above; olive-yellow collar, band on tail; crimson shoulder-patch yellow legs. They keep "wagging"their tails as they sit on the treetop, the movement is sometimes the only thing that betrays their presence. You can see both parents in the second shot.

Habitat:

Small park in a residential colony. Urban area. There are cars passing by and people everywhere...yet just at about 10 ft height, in the fork of branches where the tree had been chopped off, I have been seeing this couple raise their chicks. Only today did I get to know they have two. Actually had it not been for the fact that I saw the parents change guard one day, I would NEVER have been able to spot the bird on its eggs...the camouflage is just too good.

Notes:

In Delhi where I came to love these shy fruit--eaters I shot a video of the chick drinking pigeon milk from its mom's crop...how it kept nudging her!
