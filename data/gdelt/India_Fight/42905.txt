Rajasthan ‘custodial death’: Entire thana booked for murder

KOTA: The officer-in-charge and all 28 members of his te- am at a police station in Rajasthan ’s Baran district were on Monday booked for murder following the alleged custodial death of a 20-year-old man.Chandrabhan Singh, the station house officer of Mangrol police station, and three of his colleagues were suspended on Friday after the family of Giriraj Mali contested their statement that the youth had committed suicide by consuming a vial of poison. The remaining cops were taken off the roster and asked to go back to their barracks, as mandated by Rajasthan high court in a 2011 order on proceedings in the cases of custodial death.Giriraj’s family, however, agreed to cremate his body on Monday only after the district administration assured them that a murder case has been registered against the entire staff at the police station.“An agreement was reached on Sunday, after which the family agreed to take the youth’s body for his last rites on Monday morning,” assistant superintendent of police Vijay Swarnkar said. “As demanded by the family and a BJP delegation, a case under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) was lodged against the staff at Mangrole police station. A judicial probe is underway.”On Monday, additional district magistrate Sudershan Singh Tomar and zila parishad CEO Brijmohan Bairwa gave Giriraj’s father a cheque for Rs 3 lakh as compensation from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Giriraj had surrendered at Mangrol police station on Wednesday evening after learning of a complaint filed against him by the family of the 30-year-old mother of two he had eloped with. The woman accompanied him to the police station.According to police, he consumed poison after being told that the woman turned against him in her statement. His family disputed this version, saying the couple had a relationship for almost four years and both of them had even attempted suicide once because they couldn’t bear to part ways. Giriraj’s kin alleged that he was tortured to death after the woman left the police station on Wednesday.
