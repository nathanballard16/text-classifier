Pelosi on impeachment

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that Democrats will begin drafting articles of impeachment against President Trump, setting up a constitutional clash that Trump now says he embraces and is eager to frame on his terms when it moves to an expected Senate trial next month.

In a solo appearance at the Capitol, Pelosi argued that the president’s conduct when it came to Ukraine left Democrats with “no choice but to act,” charging that Trump abused the powers of the presidency and leaving little doubt that the House will hold a vote to impeach him in coming weeks, perhaps before Christmas.
