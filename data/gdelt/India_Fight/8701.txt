Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Feb 22 (ANI): A RSS SwayamaSevak on Friday filed a defamation case against Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for defaming the RSS after journalist Gauri Lankesh was shot dead.

The complainant Dhrutiman Joshi stated that Rahul Gandhi after the murder of the said journalist went of national media criticising the RSS and said, "anybody who speaks against the ideology of the BJP, against the ideology of the RSS is pressured, beaten, attacked and even killed."
