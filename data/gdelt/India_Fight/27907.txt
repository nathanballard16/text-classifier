Gaur City plea for police station to check thefts

NOIDA: The residents of Gaur City have appealed the district administration to help set up at least one police station within the integrated township which has at present about 20,000 families residing there for last three years.The residents in their letter to the district magistrate have informed that incidents of thefts have shot up over last three years with significant rise in snatching, street robberies and bike thefts.“We have written to the district magistrate about our plight and highlighted that the two police stations which were sanctioned have not been built yet and it is a high time to set them up,” Amit Sharma said. Sharma said that despite residents having moved into Gaur City three years ago, there has been no action taken so far to establish a police surveillance system in the township.“The roads are very unsafe and we are compelled to demand a police station. The closest police station to our area is 7 kilometres away in Bisrakh . We find it very difficult to reach out to the police to complain regarding any type of crime incidents. Therefore, police coverage of the area is urgent,” Sharma added.“Safety in Noida Extension is a significant problem. We have flagged this issue with Greater Noida Authority as well and we hope necessary action will be taken,” Now thousands of families are already living here and more are expected to come in over next six months, and it is high time these basic infrastructure was put in place,” Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association ( Nefowa ) added.“We have received the complaints from citizens. Adequate steps will be taken soon,” a district administration officer informed.
