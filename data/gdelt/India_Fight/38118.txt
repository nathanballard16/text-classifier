Fourteen booked in Jamnagar for group clash over cuss words

Rajkot: At least 14 persons of two groups were booked for rioting after they clashed over a petty issue in Jamnagar town on Monday night.

According to the police, the incident took place at Yadavnagar in Jamnagar when nine youths walked by house of a woman corporator of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC), belting profanity in abundance and loudly.

At this, the corporator’s husband, Laxman Gagiya told the youths to stop using such vulgar language. Angered over this, the group attacked Gagiya and also pelted stones at him. They also ransacked a shop nearby.

Later when the youths were having snacks at Bajrang Hotel, Gagiya came there with four other men, including the owner of the ransacked shop and beat them up with pipes and bats, injuring three of them — Darshan Bhatiya (18), Vipul Bhavani (20) and Sagar Manek (22).

Both the groups later lodged cross complaints against each other. Nine youths were booked for rioting and assault on Gagiya’s complaint. On the counter complaint file by Bhatiya, police booked Gagiya and four others also for rioting and assault.
