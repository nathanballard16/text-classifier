Parrikar is survived by two sons and their families. "Chief Minister passed away around 6.40 pm Sunday," a senior state government official told news agency PTI.

The BJP stalwart's health, which has been fluctuating for a year, took a turn for the worse in the past two days. Sources said former defence minister Parrikar had been on life support system since late Saturday night. Parrikar had been unwell since February 2018 when he was diagnosed with a pancreatic ailment.

The announcement came soon after the Goa CMO tweeted saying the health condition of Parrikar was "extremely critical" and doctors were trying their best. Following the death of former defence minister, the Government of India has announced national mourning on Monday, March 18.

Earlier in the day,Â former Goa minister and BJP core committee member Dayanand Mandrekar said the central leadership will have to take a call on new chief minister as Parrikarâ€™s health is "very critical".Â "If Manohar Parrikar was well, there would be no need to change the leader. But because his health is critical now and there is day to day deterioration (in his health condition) the party has to take some decision. I think it will happen,"Â Mandrekar said, adding that you need a chief minister to run the government.

Goa minister Vijai Sardesai on Saturday met Parrikar and said his health had "deteriorated", but he was "stable". Sardesai, along with five Goa MLAs, met Parrikar at his private residence.

The health of Parrikar, who was suffering from a pancreatic ailment, had deteriorated earlier in the day sparking hectic political activities across parties in the coastal state.

Several party leaders and allies in the state government had rushed to meet him on Saturday.Â

He was shifted to AIIMS in New Delhi on September 15 last year and returned to Goa on October 14. Since then, he had been recuperating at his private residence at Dona Paula.
