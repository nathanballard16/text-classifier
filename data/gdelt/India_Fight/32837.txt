Superman Henry Cavill's White-Haired Warrior Avatar Is Unrecognizable In Netflix's 'The Witcher'

After his near-perfect depiction of 'Superman', Henry Cavill set a benchmark for himself so high, that only other such badass characters could do justice to. Honestly, the man looks the part.

Thankfully, we don't have to wait much longer to see that being materialized, because he is all set to play 'Geralt of Rivia', the protagonist in Netflix's 'The Witcher'.

For those of you who are unaware of 'The Witcher', it is a fantasy series of short stories and novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski.

'Witchers' like Geralt of Rivia (who Cavill is playing) are monster hunters who develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle deadly beasts.

Our Superman surely has managed to look the part, replete with a badass all-black ensemble and white (or is it platinum blonde?) hair. Take a look!

While we're marvelling at the all-black warrior garb that fits Henry like a dream, what really blew our mind is the fiction-worthy, dream-like, supernatural quality the white hair is bringing to the character.

Not many can pull off hair with that super-dramatic, magical flair, but Henry clearly had no issues carrying it off.

All we can say is, a lot of people will be getting their hair coloured white now, and we don't blame them.
