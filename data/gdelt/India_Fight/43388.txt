Only Rs 1,005 crore allocated to Telangana's 2 BHK scheme, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

HYDERABAD: The 2 BHK project of the TRS government is battling a fund crunch with just 1,005 crore being allocated for the project as against the required 7,000 crore.The State government had earmarked nearly 2,400 crore for the housing department in the vote on account presented in February this year.Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced that 1,400 2 BHK houses would be constructed in each of the 119 Assembly constituencies in the state excluding GHMC area.In tune with KCR's announcement, the State government has, so far, spent over 6,200 crores on the project. Though the state has been releasing money for the project from time to time, it has been insufficient and a large chunk of this has come in the form of loans from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited.As on date, nearly 2 lakh housing units are under construction, of which nearly a lakh nearing completion. In all, the State has called for tenders for the construction of 2.38 lakh 2BHK units."The Housing department needs to clear hundreds of crores of rupees in pending bills to the contractors to take the 2-bhk scheme forward or the project will be delayed further," said the source.When contacted, a senior official in Housing department put up a brave face and said they would borrow loans from HUDCO and other banks and ensure that KCR's dream of providing 2 BHK units to the homeless is fulfilled."Despite severe criticism from opposition parties, as on date, nearly 2 lakh housing units are either nearing completion or are under various stages of construction. This is not a small achievement," said the official.
