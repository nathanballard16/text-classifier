BSF Jawan Killed in Firing by Bangladesh Border Guards

Kolkata: A Border Security Force (BSF) jawan was killed, while another injured on Thursday in firing “apparently” by the BGB troops of Bangladesh along the international border of the two countries in West Bengal, officials said.

According to a report in the Hindustan Times, the BSF jawan had accompanied his seniors to a flag meeting at 10:30 am of post commanders from both sides along the Indo-Bangladesh border where he was shot in the head by Bangladesh border guards.

Officials said that the BSF head constable has been killed along the border in the Murshidabad district after the patrol came after firing.

Preliminary information suggests that the firing was done by the troops of the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), officials said.

According to HT, the meeting had been called at the instance of the BGB after they caught three Indian villagers who were fishing in Padma river in the border area of Bengal’s Berhampore.

The BGB troops allegedly told the villagers to call the BSF post Commander for a flag meeting.

“During the flag meeting, the BGB patrol did not release Indian fisherman and also tried to cordon (gherao) BSF troops,” the BSF spokesperson said. “Sensing the situation (was) worsening, BSF party immediately returned… BGB troops opened fire on the returning BSF party,” the BSF said.

Head Constable Vijay Bhan Singh received bullet injuries on his head and another constable, who was a crew member on the boat, received bullet injuries on his right hand.

Another trooper of the border guarding force has sustained bullet injury, they said. They said a ‘flag meeting’ of ground commanders has been sought by the BSF along the border and it is currently underway.

The relations between the BSF and the BGB have been very cordial for decades and there has never been an incident of firing between the two forces.
