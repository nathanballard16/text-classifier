OnePlus

Chinese phone maker, OnePlus is gearing up to a busy few days ahead. The company is all set to launch its upcoming phones, the OnePlus 7 and Plus. The two devices are arguably one of the most anticipated devices of 2019.

However, ahead of this launch, new reports have emerged that will not come as good news to the brand. As per reports, OnePlus users have been taking up to social media to complain of a strange issue -- deleted speed dial contacts. According to users, their speed dial contacts are getting reset every day.

The issue, reports say were spotted first on the OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T, however, since then OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T users as well as those using OnePlus 6, and OnePlus 6T too have started to complain of the issue. Speaking to Android Police, the company has said that its aware of the issue and is already working towards finding a fix for it. The fix is expected to be rolled out with a future update.

While the company has promised a fix in the future, the fact remains that for now, affected users will have to get habituated to losing their speed dial contacts every day. Although not expected to hurt the company too much, this is a particularly bad time for the company to be firefighting such issues.

The company is all set to launch two new flagships on May 14 at simultaneously held events in Bengaluru, New York and London and as such, it would have preferred to have reports like these surface after the launch.
