Modi calls for people’s movement to combat perennial water scarcity

“Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water. In this campaign not only should we focus on water-related problems but propagate ways to save water as well. I specifically urge the luminaries belonging to different walks of life to lead the promotion of water conservation through innovative campaigns. Whether it be from the world of films, sports, our friends in the media, people belonging to social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as Katha - Kirtan, everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion. We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour. You’ll see, we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes,” he said.
