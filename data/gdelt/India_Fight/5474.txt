Stray dogs defecate in front of houses, scare residents

Ludhiana: With stray dogs scaring pedestrians, chasing cars and defecating in front of houses, city residents have been fazed by the menace. The issue has grown manifold mainly in areas like South Model Gram, Haibowal, Model Town, Dugri, New Model Town. Nearly 40 to 50 dog bite cases surface every week in these areas.

Hatim Alam, one of the victims of dog bite, who works at a factory near Vishwakarma Chowk, said, “I was on my way home when I saw some dogs fighting over food. I tried to walk away quickly, but one of the dogs attacked me scratching my leg with his paw which made a deep cut because of his big nails. Now, I am really scared of dogs.”

Residents said they have been battling foul smell due to the stray dogs defecating and urinating in front of their houses.

Balwant Kaur, a housewife from Dugri, said, “It’s not easy to take my grandchildren out for a walk. Some stray dogs stray start barking which scares my grandchildren. Though I try to scare the dogs away, but nothing helps.”

Jasmine Kaur, a student of Government College of Girls, said, “I usually see a pack of dogs every morning when I leave for my college. Most of the times, I notice them sitting on the roof of my car. They always leave behind scratches on my car’s body in an attempt to climb on its roof.”

“I don’t know why the authorities are not taking concrete steps to curb this menace. The stray dogs also bark a lot at night due to which our sleep gets disturbed,” said Gurvinder Pal Singh, a businessman, Vishkarma Chowk.
