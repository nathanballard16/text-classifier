Sridevi’s death anniversary: Boney, Janhavi and Khushi Kapoor to hold special puja in Chennai

Last year, on February 24, the whole country mourned the death of its beloved superstar Sridevi. The news of her sudden demise shook the entire film industry and all her fans across the globe. The English Vinglish actress was in Dubai for a family wedding along with her hubby Boney Kapoor and younger daughter Khushi. Her elder daughter Janhvi, in the meantime, was in Mumbai shooting for her film Dhadak. After attending the wedding, Boney and Khushi returned home on February 21. Two days later, Boney went back to Dubai and was looking forward to take his wifey on a dinner date. But that’s when the unfortunate tragedy struck and Bollywood lost its most precious diva forever.

Initially, it was being reported that Sridevi had suffered a massive heart attack. However, the cause of her death was accidental drowning which was later made clear. Back home, as soon as the news about Sridevi’s passing away broke, everyone from the industry rallied around Janhvi and helped her to get through the toughest phase of her life. In a recent interview, while talking about her loss, Janhvi said that the feeling still hasn’t sunk in yet and that she is yet to process everything that has happened with her over the past one year.

Exactly in sixteen days, it will be a year since Sridevi left for her heavenly abode. On her first death anniversary, Boney Kapoor along with his daughters will reportedly fly down to Chennai to attend a puja at Sridevi’s maternal home. Apart from them, media reports also suggest that Boney’s younger brother Anil Kapoor will also travel to Chennai to attend the puja along with his wife Sunita Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor and Anushla Kapoor.
