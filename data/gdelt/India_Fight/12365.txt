Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman wants to return to cockpit at the earliest

New Delhi: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman who has been undergoing medical treatment at a military hospital after returning from Pakistan conveyed to the IAF brass that he wants to return to the cockpit as soon as possible, officials said Sunday.

According to the senior IAF commanders, Varthaman told the officers and doctors treating him that he wants to start flying at the earliest. “The efforts have been to ensure that he returns to the cockpit soon,” said a military official.

The officials stated that his health condition is being monitored by a group of doctors at the Army’s Research and Referral hospital. The officials added that has been in high spirits despite the harassment he suffered in Pakistan.

Last week tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest training camp near Balakot on Tuesday.

Abhinandan, flying the MiG 21 Bison, was chasing Pakistani F-16 fighters which had transgressed into the Indian airspace, and in the process, his plane crossed over to the Pakistani side and was shot down and was captured by the Pakistani army.

Later Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the release of Varthaman, calling his move a “peace gesture.” He returned to India to a hero’s welcome on Friday night last week.
