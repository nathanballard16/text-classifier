Bolton Hindu Forum moves into new town centre base

BOLTON's Hindu community is all set to move into a high profile location in readiness for a busy autumn in the town centre.

At the end of this month, the town's Hindu community will stage a nine-day festival of dance.

And at the end of October, for the first time the community will take its Diwali celebrations into Victoria Square with a live band from India.

Bolton Hindu Forum spokesman, Manu Mistry said: "The Bolton Hindu community is about 7,500, that's the biggest in any town in the country. Only cities have bigger Hindu communities. We felt it was time to share our celebrations with the people of Bolton."

To that end, the forum wanted a new town centre location and has come to an arrangement with Bolton Market Place to take up a unit in Knowsley Street.

The official opening will be on Wednesday lunchtime when the Mayor of Bolton, Cllr Hilary Fairclough will cut the ribbon ahead of a buffet lunch for special guests.

The new base will also be a place where the Hindu community can open its activities to other people to join in.

Mr Mistry said: "The unit will be a social place, for a brew and a chat and a place where pensioners can join in knitting groups and do craftwork."

He said the unit had been provided rent-free for the next 12 months by the Market Place, and as a charity organisation the Hindu Forum would be spared a business rates bill.

Previously the forum has been based at the Veda Mandir in Chorley Road.
