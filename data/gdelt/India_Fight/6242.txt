44 CRPF Men, 44 Families: Time To Salute Selfless Families Of Men Martyred In Pulwama

In the biggest terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama since Uri camp attack of September 18, 2016, India has lost 44 sons. On February 14, a Jaish suicide bomber targeted a CRPF convoy of 70 vehicles and more than 2,500 personnel in Pulwama district. The convoy was moving from Jammu to Srinagar when it was attacked by a vehicle carrying 350 kg of explosives.



Every Indian feels the need to be avenged at the moment but let's also take the time to think about the families who selflessly send their sons, fathers, brothers to serve the nation and do not think twice before saying “Will sacrifice other son too”. That is the fire and passion among the families and the Army that silently protect us, without any regrets and still do not complain about anything!
