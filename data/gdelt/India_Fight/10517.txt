Sushma Swaraj raises the Pulwama attack during bilateral meeting with Chinese counterpart

During her bilateral meeting with Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj raised the Pulwama terror attack, a day after the IAF destroyed a major JeM terror camp in Pakistan.

“We’re aware of the recent dastardly terrorist attack on our security forces in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based and supported terrorist organisation proscribed by UN and other countries. We lost over CRPF 40 personnel while several others are injured seriously,” she said in her opening remarks.

“I am visiting China at a time when there is grief and anger in India. It is the worst terrorist attack directed against our security forces in Jammu and Kashmir,” she added. “After the Pulwama attack the entire UN has spoken with full voice to condemn it.”

Swaraj, who arrived in China, early Wednesday, said “This is our first meeting this year. Therefore, an opportune time for us to take stock of our bilateral relations and look ahead for cooperation. The India-China relationship is an important relationship for both of our countries.

“It is important to both sides to ensure thorough and effective implementation of the guidance given by our leaders. Both sides have made good efforts in this regard and we should sustain this effort,” added the EAM.

“India-China relations, as you said, is an important relationship for both of our countries. We have made substantial progress in our relations since the informal summit between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping in Wuhan in April 2018,” she added.

On February 14, Pakistan-based-JeM attacked Pulwama district, killing over 40 jawans. Following the incident, India bombed and destroyed JeM’s biggest training camp in Balakot killing a “very large number” of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders.
