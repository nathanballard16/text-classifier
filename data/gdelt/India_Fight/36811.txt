The Army, in a statement, condoled the death of the soldier

India and Pakistan are exchanging heavy artillery fire at the Tangdhar sector near the Line of Control in north Kashmir after Pakistan violated the ceasefire agreement this afternoon. The artillery fire started after an Indian soldier died in mortar shelling by Pakistan in Jammu's Sunderbani sector and two Pakistani soldiers were killed in retaliatory fire by India.

Artillery guns were used by both sides right after the Balakot air strike by India in February, but south of Pir Panjal in the Jammu region. Artillery fire has been exchanged north of Pir Panjal in Kashmir only once in January this year. In 2017, artillery guns were used once in the Poonch and Rajouri sectors.

The Indian soldier, 34-year-old Naik Krishan Lal, died in Sunderbani; Pakistan also violated the ceasefire in Keran and Machil sectors in Kashmir around 1 pm.

"In the exchange of fire, Naik Krishan Lal attained martyrdom. Naik Krishan Lal, aged 34 years belonged to Village Ghagriyal, Post Office - Khour, Tehsil - Akhnoor, District - Jammu, J&K and is survived by his wife, Smt Shashi Devi. Naik Krishan Lal was a brave, highly motivated and sincere soldier. The Nation will always remain indebted to him for the supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty," the army said in a statement.

"Heavy damage to Pak Army posts and casualties to Pak soldiers have been inflicted by own troops," the statement added.

On Monday, three civilians were injured in Poonch when Pakistan fired at the Indian side. Of those three injured, a 10-day-old baby died today.
