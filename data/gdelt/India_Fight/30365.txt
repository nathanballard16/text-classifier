Police officer injured in Anantnag terror attack dies at Delhi’s AIIMS

The police officer who was injured in a militant attack on June 12 in south Kashmir in which five CRPF men were killed succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, police said.

Station house officer of Anantnag police station, Arshad Khan was hit when motorcycle-borne militants gunned down five CRPF personnel in an audacious daylight attack on one of the busiest roads in south Kashmir’s Anantnag town.

He was shifted to a military hospital from where he was referred to Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Soura in Srinagar.

Police said that he was airlifted to AIIMS, Delhi in the morning when his health deteriorated.

“He was airlifted to AIIMS, where he succumbed. He is being brought back,” said deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, south Kashmir, Atul Kumar Goel.

Doctors at SKIMS said that he had a bullet injury in his abdomen.

According to his colleagues in Anantnag police station, Khan, 40, a resident of Srinagar had joined police force in 2000. He is survived by his wife and two children.

Two motorcycle-borne militants had driven down KP Road and opened fire at 4.50pm at a contingent of CRPF personnel belonging to the 161 Battalion that was deployed at the spot. The CRPF personnel were on law-and-order duty and part of the Road Opening Party.

This was the first major strike on security forces since the February 14 suicide strike in Pulwama that killed 40 soldiers in what was the worst attack in Kashmir’s history.
