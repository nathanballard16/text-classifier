North-East Delhi: Fear grips residents; few talk about the incident

Fear was evident on the faces of the residents and they refused to talks about the incident. Aafak's wife Reshma is five-month pregnant with their fourth child and clueless about their future as the only earning member of the family is no more. Aafak is survived by his wife Reshma and three children — two sons Altaf and Rizwan and a daughter Afsa. Reshma had gone to the hospital as Rizwan had fractured his fingers in the incident. Fear gripped the residents of Janta Colony in the Welcome area after a 30-year-old man was shot dead on Sunday evening by a neighbour when the former objected to his dog barking at him.
