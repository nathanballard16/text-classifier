Noting that the 'advancement in technology' has led to a 'revolution in military affairs' adding new dimensions to future warfare, Army Chief Bipin Rawat on Sunday stressed the need for spending more on artificial intelligence to compete with 'our adversary on the northern borders'.

Speaking at the valedictory session of the national conference on "Self-reliance in Defence Manufacturing edition 2.0 in Hyderabad, General Rawat said; "I dare to say that as of now we understand what artificial intelligence and big data analysis is but I don't think we really understood how to incorporate this and utilise this to our advantage. So it is important that we incorporate the industry to see what advantages can come through artificial intelligence and all the data available and how can we utilise it to our benefit".

He added that India should ensure that it empires in military systems in weapons, equipment and ammunition.

Talking about the future dimensions of warfare, General Rawat said; "There is a revolution in military affairs that is taking place due to advancement in technology. Indian defence forces should be prepared for future dimensions of warfare, whether it is defence of our borders, combating proxy walls, terrorism, insurgencies or other internal security disturbances".

Emphasising the need for defence technologies, General Rawat said; "We should be spending on defence technologies. 'Make in India' initiatives are moving fast. We have opened our procedures to industries. What do we need to address on a priority is intelligence and surveillance".
