Swati Maliwal sent summons to the Delhi Police and Municipal Corporation of Delhi

The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) raided three spa centres in the past two days and found that the establishments were running a sex racket under the garb of spa services.

DCW's chairperson Swati Maliwal has accused the Delhi Police of colluding with the spa centres running the sex racket. Swati Maliwal also sent summons to the Delhi Police and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Swati Maliwal questioned the police and the corporation why the licence of the establishments was not cancelled.

Swati Maliwal said that the DCW received information that Crown Spa Centre was running a sex racket and she along with a DCW team visited the spa centre in Madhu Vihar, New Delhi after receiving information.

Two more spa centres -- Jasmine and Jannat -- in Nawada near Dwarka in New Delhi were raided on Thursday. In one case the police have not registered an FIR. The DCW found that in many rooms, people were found in compromising position along with other objectionable things.

A schoolgirl was also found among other girls there at the spa centre.

Swati Maliwal said that that the DCW rescued nine girls from the spa centres.
