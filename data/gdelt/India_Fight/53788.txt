No pardon to Beant’s assassin, says Shah

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said no pardon had been given to Balwant Singh Rajoana , who was convicted for assassination of then Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in 1995.Shah was responding to the issue raised by Congress member from Punjab Ravneet Singh Bittu during Question Hour in Lok Sabha.Asking the member not to go by media reports, Shah said, “koi maafi nahi di gayi hai (no pardon has been given).”There were reports in September on the central government’s decision to commute the death sentence of Rajoana to life imprisonment. It was then reported that the decision was taken as a “humanitarian gesture” on the occasion of 550th birth celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev.Rajoana, a former Punjab Police constable, was convicted for his involvement in an explosion outside the Punjab civil secretariat that killed Beant Singh and 16 others in 1995.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which is part of the Narendra Modi government, had said the decision of commutation of death sentence would go a long way in assuaging the “hurt” feelings of the Sikh community who had to go through “unspeakable repression and humiliation during those dark days” when Punjab was pushed into terrorism.Rajoana was scheduled to be hanged on March 31, 2012. However, the execution was stayed on March 28, 2012, by the then UPA government at the Centre after Shiromoni Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee, the Sikh religious body, filed a mercy petition.SAD, which was then in office in Punjab, had campaigned against his execution. According to a news agency report, the President had forwarded the plea to the home ministry to take a call on it. Since then the petition has been pending.
