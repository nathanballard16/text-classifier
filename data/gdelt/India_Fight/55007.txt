No one injured in fire at downtown Lewiston restaurant

No one was injured in a late night fire at a downtown Lewiston restaurant Monday night.

The Lewiston Fire Department and Police Department were dispatched around 10 PM to a reported possible explosion with fire at the Emperor of India at 854 Main Street. Arriving units found heavy flames and smoke coming from all windows on the Main Street side of the business.

The first engine company attacked the fire with a deck gun, helping crews to confine the blaze to the building of origin and controlling the main body of the fire in less than 20 minutes.

There was some fire, smoke and water damage to the business just to the west of the fire building, while there was no damage to the Wells Fargo Bank to the east. Crews remained on scene putting out hot spots and conducting a fire watch.

The cause of the blaze is under investigation and the estimated damage is not yet known. (Lewiston Fire Department)
