Operations Slowly Resume at JKIA as Military Officers Take Over

Following aviation workers' strike that entirely paralyzed operations at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) for the better part of Wednesday morning, normal business is slowly returning at the airport.

This comes after the government deployed military officers from the Kenya Air Force to assist in operations.

Two flights have since departed JKIA after military personnel began manning counters.

The Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airline flights have left the airport 12 hours after aviation workers downed their tools.

Two other flights that had earlier been diverted to Tanzania's Kilimanjaro airport and Mombasa's Moi International Airport have since landed at the JKIA.

“KQ 349 from Khartoum had been diverted to Kilimanjaro. This flight landed in Nairobi at 0517hrs. KQ505 from Accra that had been diverted to Mombasa arrived at 0559hrs,” KQ says in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.

Three other flights to London, Amsterdam, and Mumbai are also expected to depart from the JKIA.

On Wednesday, anti-riot police officers engaged in running battles with the striking aviation workers. The officers were forced to lob teargas canisters to disperse them.

The striking employees under the Kenya Aviation Workers Union (KAWU) are opposing the handover of management of JKIA to loss-making Kenya Airways.

They also accuse the KQ leadership of financial wastage through payment of hefty salaries to senior Polish managers and consultants.

KAWU Secretary General Moss Ndiema has been arrested, with Transport CS James Macharia labeling the striking workers as criminals and economic saboteurs.

“Nobody has refused to pay your salary, nobody has given a threat that your job is at risk this is therefore malicious, economic sabotage and criminal activity,” Macharia says.
