China's move counterproductive

China once again proved it's true nature by blocking India's efforts to ban and declare terrorist outfit founder Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) as 'international terrorist' as per UNO's 1267 ISIL. It appears it repeated what it did in 2008,2016 and 2017.With this the intention of China is to containment of India to promote it's territorial hegemony interests in South Asian region.

It also because Pakistan is crucial link to China's ties with the Muslims' world to import oil from them. It is strange that Beijing is seeking further evidence to designate Azar as a global terrorist, Inspite of Azhar's outfit not only claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror strike that killed 40 CRPF personnel but also fresh warnings of attacks on Indian cities.

Moreover it is also well known fact that JeM's chief is master mind of several attacks including on Parliament, J&K Assembly ,Pathankot air force base, the army camp at Uri. It seems China is playing in the hands of Pakistan's narrative of good terrorists versus bad terrorists to appease the Muslims in Uighur.

But both Beijing and Islamabad should mind that there is no good and bad terrorism and it is monster that can destroy even its creators. With this attitude China not only defeats the good intention of India but also hurts the feelings of the US,UK and France that backed India's policy of isolation of Pakistan in terrorism. India also must use all available sources to bring terror groups to justice.
