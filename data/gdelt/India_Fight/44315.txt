ED seizes Rs 32 lakh, USD 10,000 from TMC MP KD Singh’s residence

New Delhi: The ED said Friday it has seized cash amounts of Rs 32 lakh and USD 10,000 after it raided the ‘official residence’ of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP KD Singh here and few other locations as part of a money laundering probe against him and others.

The central agency said searches were launched Thursday at seven locations here and Chandigarh including at registered offices of 14 group companies of the Alchemist Group that is ‘related to and controlled’ by the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP).

“During searches, a number of documents reflecting the circular nature of transactions, digital evidences and property documents were seized at the official residence of Kanwar Deep Singh in Delhi and cash of Rs 32 lakh along with foreign exchange worth USD 10,000 was found and seized,” the ED said in a statement. It said the official residence of the MP is at Tughlaq Lane, in the Lutyens bungalow zone of the national capital.

The central probe agency had last year summoned the MP, said to be sidelined in the TMC, as part of these investigations. While Singh had resigned from the post of chairman of the Alchemist group in 2012, he is stated to be the Chairman, Emeritus and founder of the business group.

The agency said it also searched KD Singh’s house in Chandigarh and of two directors linked to his companies. The ED is probing KD Singh, his linked firms and associates as part of two money laundering cases, it said.

The first is based on an FIR filed by the Kolkata Police while the other is on the basis of a chargesheet filed by market regulator SEBI.
