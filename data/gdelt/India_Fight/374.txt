Some of Tamil Nadu's best-known eateries, including the world-famous Saravana Bhavan chain, were raided by the Income Tax (I-T) Department on Thursday as dozens of sleuths took part in searches in the state.

A total of 32 places were raided, and under the scanner were companies like Saravana Bhavan, Hot Breads, Grand Sweets and Snacks and Anjappar.

The raids began at 8 am.

The hotels' daily operations did not suffer as the raids took place at corporate offices and at the homes of company directors.

Probing charges of income suppression: Officials

Officials quoted by the Press Trust of India said the I-T department was looking into allegations of suppression of income (by the groups raided) by various means, and so decided to conduct searches and obtain further evidence.

Homes and offices of directors of the food chains were being raided by a team of over 100 I-T sleuths, the officials said.

Nakheeran, a Tamil magazine whose editor's recent arrest made headlines, said it had been informed that the raids were carried out because the restaurant chains underreported their income for four years. However, the journal added that the "full reason" of the searches was still unknown.

Founded by P Rajagopalan, Saravana Bhavan is one of the country's best-known South Indian eateries. But it also has a global presence, with outlets in five continents. Saravana Bhavan has been raided before.

Anjappar, which specialises in cuisine from the Chettinad region, has also expanded abroad.

Grand Sweets and Snacks has several outlets in Chennai.
