Srinagar, April 7

People’s Conference chairman Sajad Gani Lone on Sunday said National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah was “the best separatist when out of power and a tyrannical mainstreamer when in power”.

He made the comments while addressing a gathering at Hanjiveera, Pattan, in Baramulla district.

Stating that the “squeaky clean” Omar had forgotten “2010 massacre of young children whom he labelled as drug addicts and criminals after he sent the young souls to their graves”, Sajad said: “He has also forgotten that he opposed the application moved by Afzal Guru for shifting to Kashmir jail... he also seems to have forgotten that he was the first person from Kashmir ever, to be a part of the BJP government at the Centre in 1999.”

“And what was his job? His job at the height of human rights violations in 1999 was to travel across the globe and present the Indian view to the world community. So while the Kashmiris were being killed, Omar was defending the killers across the world capitals. Much the same way his grandfather Sheikh sahib towed New Delhi on Kashmir at the UN in 1948,” he added.

Sajad said Omar’s father NC president Farooq Abdullah had “unleashed the brutal Ikhwan regime on to the hapless Kashmiris between 1996 and 2002”. He also claimed that New Delhi was willing to give autonomy to Kashmir in 1995-96, but Farooq preferred power to it.
