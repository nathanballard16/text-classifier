3 arrested in Govind Pansare murder were involved in murders of Dabholkar, Gauri Lankesh and Kalburgi

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Maharashtra Police on Friday arrested three persons in connection with the murder of communist leader Govind Pansare in 2015.

The three accused have been identified as Sachin Andere, Ganesh Mishkin and Amit Baddi. Sachin Andere, also accused in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case, was identified by the CBI as one of the shooters involved in the murder of the rationalist. On the other hand, Ganesh Mishkin and Amit Baddi were involved in murders of journalist Gauri Lankesh and Karnataka scholar MM Kalburgi.

This could make the total number of arrests in the Govind Pansare case to 12. It was only after Karnataka SIT probe into Gauri Lankesh's murder that the complete network of Sanatan Sanstha members and others from right wing organisations involved in the four murders came to light.

Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had conducted multiple raids and seized a large number of weapons and raw material for making of crude bombs in August last year.

A large number of weapons were also seized which helped dismantle a module of members associated with right wing organisations like Sanatan Sanstha and others planning on launching terror attacks at events and also their involvement in multiple murders of rationalists.

The three accused were produced in a Pune court which remanded them to police custody till September 16.
