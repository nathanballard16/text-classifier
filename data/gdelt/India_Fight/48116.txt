Six Arrested After Hindu Leader Kamlesh Tiwari’s Murder in Broad Daylight in Uttar Predesh

In a joint operation by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the Uttar Pradesh Police, six people including a Muslim cleric have been held for their alleged involvement in the killing of prominent Hindu leader Kamlesh Tiwari in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh on Saturday.

According to Gujarat ATS, the murder plot was hatched in Dubai and the murder weapon, recovered from the spot, was bought in Surat.

"We found a sweet box at the incident spot and we found many clues in it. I spoke to the Gujarat DGP and we have sent our team there. There is a strong coordination between the Gujarat police and us," said a Uttar Pradesh police officer at a press conference on Saturday morning.

Tiwari had been facing death threats since 2015 over his allegedly inflammatory remarks about Muslims and the Prophet Mohammed.
