Saaho: Release date of Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhas starrer gets postponed; READ Details

The upcoming movie Saaho happens to be one of the most awaited movies of the year 2019. The movie, starring Baahubali actor Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor in the lead roles, has created a lot of buzz in the media ever since its inception. Both the trailer as well as the songs of the movie have already been released which have received tremendous response from the fans. Now, all the fans are eagerly waiting for the movie's release into the theatres soon.

However, according to the latest reports, the release date of Saaho may get shifted. Earlier, the movie was scheduled to be released into the theatres on August 15, 2019 on the occasion of India's Independence Day. But now, the movie is slated to be released on August 30, 2019. As per the reports, two Telugu movies, namely the Sharwanand starrer Ranarangam and Adivi Sesh's Evaru are scheduled to be released on August 15, 2019 because of which Saaho's release date has been postponed. Two more Bollywood movies namely Mission Mangal and Batla House will also be releasing on the same date which might be another reason for Saaho's release date to be postponed.

Saaho happens to be an action thriller movie which has been directed by Sujeeth. Other than Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhas, the movie will also feature Jackie Shroff, Murli Sharma, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Chunky Pandey, Evelyn Sharma, Mandira Besi, Mahesh Manjrekar and many others in the pivotal roles.
