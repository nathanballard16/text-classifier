Meenu Jain, an IndiGo pilot’s wife who was found dead at her Dwarka home last Thursday, was murdered by a debt-ridden man.

According to reports, accused Dinesh Dixit had befriended her through a social media application. He is a resident of Jaipur and knew the victim for the last few months.

On Monday afternoon, Dixit was nabbed by cops from Jaipur and brought to Delhi. They tracked his electronic trail despite his efforts to cover his tracks.

Meenu Jain’s husband, Vinod Jain is a former IAF Wing Commander.

During the investigation, cops examined CCTV footage of the gated society. It showed an unknown white-coloured car entering the gate on April 26. From here the investigation gained pace leading to the accused.

Dixit visited the house many times in the past as well. The prime motive behind the murder was robbery, said police.

In Dwarka Sector 7, Meenu was found dead at her residence in Air Force and Naval Officer’s Enclave. Her post-mortem stated that she had been smothered to death.
