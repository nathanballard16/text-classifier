Amita undergoes weight loss surgeries lost 214 kg weight

A decade ago, she became bedridden due to obesity. Her trip to the hospital was the first time she stepped out of the house. “Once when I fell off the bed, it took six men and three hours to put me back up,” Amita said. A special ambulance was arranged in which a six-and-a-half-inch sofa was fitted to carry her to the hospital.

Her life took a turn for the worse when at the age of six, she started piling up on the kilos. At 16, she weighed 126 kg and found it difficult to carry out routine tasks. After she hit 300 kg, she had to be constantly assisted.“Amita required constant attention. She required the help of others to go to the washroom and do other chores which normal people can do on their own. We had lost all hope at one point,” her mother Mamta Rajani said.
