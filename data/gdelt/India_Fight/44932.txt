In the south of India, monsoon rains are once again synonymous with death and destruction. This year, in the state of Kerala, at least 140 people were killed, and more than 250,000 forced to flee, with thousands still displaced. The devastation is not only due to the extreme rainfall, but also the uncontrolled extraction of granite, causing landslides; and rivers being mined for sand, causing floods.
