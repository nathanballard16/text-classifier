The nine point agenda presented is below.

The Leaders' Declaration, adopted at the G20 Buenos Aires Summit, says that the member countries will explore the links between corruption and other economic crimes and ways to tackle them, "including through cooperation on the return of persons sought for such offences and stolen assets, consistent with international obligations and domestic legal systems".

The declaration, sources said, reflects the will exhibited by the G20 members to tackle the issue of return of persons sought for economic offences and stolen assets through international cooperation.

The nine-point agenda for economic offenders calls for strong and active cooperation across G-20 countries to deal comprehensively and efficiently with the menace of fugitive economic offenders.

It seeks cooperation in the legal processes such as effective freezing of the proceeds of crime, early return of the offenders and says efficient repatriation of the proceeds of crime should be enhanced and streamlined.

The other points are: "Joint effort by G-20 countries to form a mechanism that denies entry and safe havens to all fugitive economic offenders."

"Principles of United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNOTC), especially related to 'International Cooperation' should be fully and effectively implemented."

"FATF (Financial Action Task Force) should be called upon to assign priority and focus to establishing international co-operation that leads to timely and comprehensive exchange of information between the competent authorities and FIUs."

"FATF should be tasked to formulate a standard definition of fugitive economic offenders."

"FATF should also develop a set of commonly agreed and standardized procedures related to identification, extradition and judicial proceedings for dealing with fugitive economic offenders to provide guidance and assistance to G-20 countries, subject to their domestic law."

"Common platform should be set up for sharing experiences and best practices including successful cases of extradition, gaps in existing syst from Singapore on June 27, 2016 in attempt to murder case.
