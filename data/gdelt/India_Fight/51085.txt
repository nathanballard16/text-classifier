Gang Scamming People by Promising Jobs in Indian Army Busted

Patna: Police in Patna on late Sunday night arrested three men and charged them with running a fake employment agency scam that took in many victims to the tune of several lakh rupees.

Talking to the reporters, Patna Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manu Maharaj said that acting on a tip-off, police raided a house in Rupaspur in Patna district and arrested kingpin Munna Singh, Jagdish Singh, and Pintu Kumar while also seizing Rs. 15 lakh in cash, a metal detector, note-counting machine, a printer, a laptop computer, dozens of ATM cards and nearly a dozen cellphones. Police also seized an SUV from the property.

Police also seized nearly 200 job applications along with educational certificates submitted by the victims hoping they would soon have a job in the Indian Army.

The three had been running the scam for quite some time, police said. On Sunday night, they were busy raking in money from their targets just hours before the exam for the recruitment of general duty police at Danapur Cantonment when the police carried out the raid and took the three into custody.

The three men were charging exorbitant amount of money from unsuspecting young men by promising them to get a job in the Indian Army, the SSP said,
