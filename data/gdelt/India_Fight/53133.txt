I'm so disturbed and shocked at What has happened to #PriyankaReddy

This happening in my country angers me, makes my blood boil.

The punishment to these murderers and rapists should be so severe for such a heinous crime.#RIPPriyankaReddy — Karanvir Bohra (@KVBohra) November 29, 2019

So furious. Wonder if there's any safe place whatsoever. Tragic to see women victimised every day. Capital punishment to the guilty is a must. Adequate safety is the need of the hour. Let's not wait for a situation to become an emergency.#JusticeForPriyankaReddy — Kajal Aggarwal (@MsKajalAggarwal) November 29, 2019

No reaction can explain the pain I felt hearing what happened to Priyanka. Laws and police are there to control crimes but not animals. Creating enough awareness regarding punishments is much needed. #RIPPriyankaReddy — Ravi Teja (@RaviTeja_offl) November 29, 2019

Angry. Saddened. Shocked. Speechless. Hearing such heart-wrenching news even today is absolutely disturbing. Let us work together as a society to bring a change and put an end to this barbarism. #JusticeForPriyankaReddy pic.twitter.com/onCJdoILKB — Sai Dharam Tej (@IamSaiDharamTej) November 29, 2019
