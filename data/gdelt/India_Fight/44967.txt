Bail for Assam priest battling missionaries

JORHAT: The subdivisional judicial magistrate court at Majuli in Assam on Wednesday granted regular bail to influential Dakshinpat Ashromi satraadhikar (head priest) Janardan Deva Goswami, who has been accused of preventing spread of Christianity."It is very unfortunate that I have been charged for my work done for the protection of my culture and religion. I believe it is my duty to protect my culture and religion at this ancient seat of Vaishnavite culture," said Goswami. He added, "I appeared before the court. I am ready to comply with the order of the court as and when required."Goswami said this was probably the first time a head priest of a satra at the hub of Vaishnavite culture was facing criminal charges in court.
