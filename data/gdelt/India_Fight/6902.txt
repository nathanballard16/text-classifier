Indian army in rare admission of guilt

NEW DELHI: The Indian army has admitted it made a mistake in shooting dead two teenagers in India-held Kashmir this week, in a rare public admission of fault by the military.

The teenagers died after soldiers fired at a car on the outskirts of Srinagar on Monday, while at least one other youngster was critically wounded.

“We take responsibility for the death of the two boys in Kashmir,” the chief of the army’s northern command, D.S. Hooda, told reporters in Srinagar late on Friday in televised remarks.

“We admit a mistake was made... there was some information about a white car with terrorists. Obviously, the identity was mistaken in this case,” the lieutenant-general added.

Gen Hooda promised an investigation into the deaths that would be conducted with “the highest standard of transparency”.

Anger has been mounting in the scenic Kashmir valley over the killings, with the families of the deceased rejecting the army’s offer of Rs1 million as compensation.

“The blood of my 14-year-old son is not so cheap that I would barter it. I reject this compensation,” Mohammad Yousuf Bhat, the father of one of the boys, was quoted as saying by the Times of India newspaper on Saturday.

Human rights critics accuse Indian security forces — estimated to number half a million in occupied Kashmir — of committing frequent rights abuses while fighting militants.

Indian officials say all allegations are investigated and the guilty are punished. However, punishments are rarely made public and soldiers are often tried by the army itself.

Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the latest killings had marred the political atmosphere, already strained by the recent devastating floods.

“Such killings have no place in an otherwise improving security environment where militancy incidents are at record low levels,” Mr Abdullah tweeted this week.
