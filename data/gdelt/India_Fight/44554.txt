India and USA fighting to combat radical Islam, secure border: Trump without naming Pakistan

Houston: Without naming Pakistan, US President Donald Trump on Sunday said border security is vital to both India and USA and they are committed to fighting radical Islam.

Addressing Indian Americans at a huge gathering in the presence of PM Modi after a historic introduction of Trump by the Indian PM at the NRG stadium in Houston in Texas, Trump said border security is vital to both nations.

"We are taking steps to stop illegal immigration," said Trump and though he did not name Pakistan, his words were a veiled jibe at Pakistan exporting terrorism in Indian Kashmir.

Trump's speech and choice of words like "radical Islam" and "border security" ahead of Modi's attendance in the UN session and after the Kashmir move, assumes significance. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to raise the issue of Kashmir at the UN. Imran Khan is also trying to raise the issue with Donald Trump.

Claiming that India never had a better friend in the White House than before, Trump heaped praise on Modi and thanked Indian Americans for their contribution to USA.

He said both he and Modi are trying to keep the people safe and secure from Islamic terrorism and illegal immigration that plagued both countries.

As Trump mentioned these words, Indian Americans stood up and cheered for the US President.
