Citizenship Act protests HIGHLIGHTS: Crackdown on students assault on soul of India, says Priyanka Gandhi

The Opposition parties also condemned the police action in Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia and targeted the Centre. Demanding a judicial inquiry, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said, "Police can't enter into university premises without the permission of Vice-Chancellor. If they weren't permitted, how did Police, which comes under Central govt, enter into the campus? We condemn it. There should be a judicial inquiry." CPM leader Sitaram Yechury who was also present at the presser asked, "Where is the Home Minister."

Scrambling to cope with the spurt in violence, the state government suspended Internet services in four districts and parts of two others while police resorted to lathicharge to disperse protesters who ransacked shops and burnt tyres to block roads in parts of the state.

Indicating the areas from where unrest was reported, the state government said: “Under the circumstances, left with no other alternative, Internet services are being temporarily suspended in the districts of Uttar (North) Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Howrah, and parts of North 24 Parganas (Basirhat and Barasat subdivisions) and parts of South 24 Parganas (Baruipur and Canning subdivisions).”

Among the railway stations vandalised were those at Murshidabad’s Tildanga, Reginagar, Krishnapur and Monigram, Malda’s Bhaluka, and Birbhum’s Nalhati and Lohapur.

In South 24 Parganas’s Akra railway station, protesters vandalised several rooms, including ticket counters, and targeted two local trains.

Rail services were hit at Diamond Harbour, and at Lalgola and Farakka in Murshidabad. In Farakka, a group led by Congress MLA Moinul Haque took to the streets wielding sticks to disperse a mob that targeted the railway station.

Shops were ransacked and tyres burnt in North 24 Parganas districts, while protests were reported from parts of Howrah, Burdwan and Birbhum.
