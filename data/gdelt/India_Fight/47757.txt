Cracker licence holders sub-letting kiosks: Assn chief

Amritsar Fireworks Association president Harish Dhawan said allottees were engaged in deals with interested people, especially licensee firecracker dealers, to make most of the opportunity. He said two kiosks were sub-let on Wednesday for over Rs 4 lakh each. Most of the lucky winners of the draw of lots were those who did not have any experience in the firecracker trade. However, with a view to earn quick bucks they went for the draw of lots, which was like a godsend opportunity. There are 32 licence holders in the city dealing in manufacturing, storage and possession of crackers in addition to two Union Government licensed firecracker manufacturing units.
