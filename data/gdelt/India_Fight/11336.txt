India’s cowardly act

Two Indian warplanes entered Pakistani territory on Monday night. The Pakistani Air Force was able to counter them in a befitting manner. In the aftermath of the Pulwama attack, the Modi government has been threatening Pakistan with war.In response, Prime Minister Imran Khan said in his speech that, if India was to attack, Pakistan would retaliate, and Wednesday’s events were reflective of these statements.However, if we analyse the situation rationally, and the way events have unfolded over the past few days, then Pakistan should not respond to Indian threats of war with equal aggression, as this can escalate the situation further.A resulting war will be disastrous for both sides, with no end in sight especially with both sides possessing nuclear weapons.As Pakistanis, we should deal with this situation logically and use this chance to expose India’s warmongering tactics and violation of human rights with their constant attacks on civilians, to the international community.Even though our country is well-equipped to respond to Indian aggression, we should look at the broader perspective and not give in to pressure of any kind.Javed Mohsin SyedPublished in The Express Tribune, March 1, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
