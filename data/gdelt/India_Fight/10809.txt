PAF’s victory for Pakistan

OUR brave Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Army won the hearts of the people by responding to India’s air space violation on Tuesday, shooting down two Indian air force fighter jets on Wednesday.

According to reports, two Indian pilots have also been taken prisoner. It is a victory for Pakistan and a huge setback to Narendra Modi’s election campaign.

It is an embarrassment and humiliation for India. The response by PAF is a clear warning to India that if it continues such violations, it will face more fatalities and embarrassment.

Our civil and military leadership is united and has an excellent defence and diplomatic approach. On the contrary, India has nothing except false claims of ‘surgical strikes’. Kudos for Pakistani armed forces!

Pakistan zindabad! Armed force paindadbad!

PAF brought victory for Pakistan after Pakistani pilots brought down two intruding Indian aircraft.

As soon as two Indian jets entered the Line of Control, PAF retaliated and gave a befitting reply by shooting them down, highlighting the fact that sovereignty matters for us.

The threats by New Delhi failed to dampen our spirits. We remained patient and assured the nation that the retaliation would be great.

However, now both countries can still compensate and have a dialogue to settle the issues.
