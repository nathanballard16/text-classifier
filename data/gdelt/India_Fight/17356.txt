On Monday, a terrorist hideout was busted in J&K's Shermal Shopian. "Incriminating" material and other items have been recovered from the site, an official said. Hideout has been blasted so that terrorist can't use the hideout in future, he said. J&K police has filed an FIR and further investigation is going on, he added.
