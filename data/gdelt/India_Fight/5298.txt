Police seize huge amount of cartridges, arrest 3 persons

The Police have seized a huge amount of cartridges, unassembled parts of AK-47 rifle and arrested three arms smugglers from Bihar's Purnea district, a senior officer said Sunday.

A police patrolling team stopped a vehicle in Baisi area on Thursday during routine checking and found 600 live cartridges and arrested three arms smugglers, Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Kundan Krishnan told reporters here.

After a thorough checking of the vehicle the police recovered various parts of firearms and 1000 additional cartridges which were hidden in specially built boxes inside the vehicle.

The police found that there were three AK 47 rifles after assembling the various firearms parts seized, the ADGP said.

During interrogation, the three arrested persons confessed that they used to supply arms and weapons to Mukesh Singh of Patna and Santosh Singh of Bhojpur, Krishnan said.

The police raided Mukesh Singhs house in Patna on Saturday and seized 50 cartridges, he said adding that Mukesh has been absconding since then.

Police are also considering to hand over the case to Central agency as arms bore the 'MA' mark which shows that the arms are of Myanmar Army and have been smuggled into India, the ADGP added.
