Tara Sutaria finds a new BFF in Kareena Kapoor Khan & Ranbir Kapoor's cousin Aadar Jain? Here's what's cooking

She might have made her debut competing for the Student of The Year in SOTY 2, but Tara Sutaria is turning out the friend of the year for Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ranbir Kapoor's cousin Aadar Jain. The actress, who made her silver screen debut alongside Ananya Panday and Tiger Shroff in the Puneet Malhotra directorial, is making heads turn with her friendship with Aadar. For the unversed, Aadar has already made his not-so-impressive Bollywood debut in a movie called Qaidi Band. The movie released in 2017.

The new BFFs in B-Town were reportedly spotted at a popular Mumbai suburban restaurant several times, bonding over numerous things. Insiders told Mumbai Mirror that Tara broke the ice between the two and offered a hand of friendship. The two stars were introduced to each other through common friends.

“Tara is a friendly girl who quickly broke the ice and drew out the normally reserved Aadar. They share a lot in common,” the source told the daily. This isn't the first time that news about their blooming friendship has made the headlines. Last week, Deccan Chronicle also reported that Tara and Aadar were getting close. A grapevine told the outlet, "They are happy meeting at parties and spending time with each other rather than go out on quiet dinners which don’t’ turn out so quiet when the paparazzi start snapping."

We wonder what they bond on! Meanwhile, earlier this year, Tara was linked to Sidharth Malhotra. Tiger Shroff even teased the duo on their debut episode of Koffee With Karan. However, Tara shot the rumours down almost immediately.
