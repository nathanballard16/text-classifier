Pulwama attack: 15 held in Assam for anti-India, pro-Pakistan posts

GUWAHATI: Assam Police have so far arrested 15 persons, mostly teenagers, for allegedly putting anti-India and pro-Pakistan posts on social media since the Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaishe-e-Mohammed on February 14 in which 42 Crpf personnel were martyred.Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma while addressing the media here said that these persons were arrested under various provisions of IPC, including, charges of sedition, provocation with intent to cause a riot, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race and assertions prejudicial to national integration."We have identified 19 such people for making objectionable anti-India posts and out these 15 have been arrested," Sarma said. Police are unable to locate many other people, who have put such posts on social media because they are suspected to have used fake identities.He said that Assam Police had been alerted to take a tough stand against anyone posting such anti-India and pro-Pakistan materials in social media."We have noticed that some of the handles sued to make such anti-India posts are also the same handles which were used to make some disturbing posts in last four months (when the state was engulfed by the protests against the Citizenship Bill)," Sarma said."These people are trying to weaken the society. These elements live in India but would always prefer Pakistan over India. When BJP and Congress are fighting, these people will side with Congress but if Congress is fighting with some fundamental group , these people will side with the fundamentalist group,” Sarma said.One 17-year-old Tejpur boy was among 15 people arrested by the Assam Police.
