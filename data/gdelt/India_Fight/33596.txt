Jammu and Kashmir Governor says people in charge destroyed forests

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik accused people assigned to protect forests in J&K of destroying them and of buying bungalows in posh areas of the national capital, even as he reiterated that his administration is committed to expose corrupt people in the state.Speaking to media persons at Zabarwan Hills on Monday after launching a drive to plant five million trees in the state by June 2020, Malik said, “Those people who were responsible for protection of forests have instead destroyed them ruthlessly and bought bungalows in Maharani Bagh and Vasant Vihar of Delhi.”He said he knows many families who made millions just because they were in charge of the forest department in the state.Malik said that his administration does not believe in “political vendetta” and that “no extent of influence or party affiliation” will save corrupt people in the state. With the Centre extending President’s rule in the state for another six months with effect from July 3, Malik said that he is not going anywhere soon and is committed to cleanse the system.The ‘Green J&K’ drive launched by Malik coincides with the BJP’s initiative of planting trees and conserving water during its membership drive. The Governor’s administration has strengthened the Anti-Corruption Bureau in the state, which has been investigating high-profile cases including fraudulent appointments in J&K Bank and has raided offices of some influential politicians and businessmen.“There is no vendetta against anybody. During the natural course (of investigation), even if influential people come in the net, we won’t discriminate or hesitate and won’t consider party affiliations. Law is always supreme,” said Malik.
