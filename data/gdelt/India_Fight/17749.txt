Fire engulfs power plant near Ghogha

Source of fire was the conveyor belt in the plant

Rajkot: A major fire broke out at the power plant of Bhavnagar Energy Company Limited at Padava village near Ghogha in Bhavnagar district on early Friday morning.

It took six hours for the fire-fighters from Bhavnagar fire brigade and personnel from the power plant to douse the fire.

“The source of the fire was the conveyor belt in the plant. The plant is lignite based which ignited the fire into an inferno that charred a major portion of the plant's machinery,” said Pradyumansinh Jadeja, station officer of Bhavnagar fire brigade.

Pradeep Dahake, managing director of Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Limited, said, “Fortunately, there was no casualty reported in the incident. We have decided to form a team to investigate the cause of the fire and ascertain the incurred loss. The plant will resume its functions within two-three days.”
