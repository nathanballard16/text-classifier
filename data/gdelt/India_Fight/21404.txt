The police had already sent to the jail one of my two sons, both who have been booked under section 326 of IPC. The police from last six months were harassing us by conducting raids in our house to nab my second son Naib Singh. The cops used to rebuke and insult us and even sometimes thrash us but we could not say anything to them. Naib had not come to my house since he was booked in the case six months back and we do not know about his whereabouts but the cops did not believe my wife and tortured her to death.
