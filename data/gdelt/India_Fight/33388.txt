Separatists call for Valley shutdown today

SRINAGAR: Kashmiri separatist group Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) on Saturday called for a complete shutdown across the Valley on the third death anniversary of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani and his associates. The anniversary falls on July 8.Hizb commander Burhan and his associates were killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, 2016. The elimination of the terrorists had then triggered wide-spread violence across the Valley, which claimed the lives of 126 people, including policemen.While calling for a shutdown on Monday, a JRL statement said no nation can afford to lose its generations in such fast pace and Kashmiris also want resolution of this bleeding issue without further bloodshed. “Our youths have been forced to take extreme steps as their peaceful cries and democratic posturing were responded with brute and unmatched force,” the statement read.“Unending curbs on political activities, continuous detention of resistance leadership and denial of basic human values have added to the already existing political uncertainty in the state and, as such, our youths are quite disheartened with the prevailing situation,” the statement said.
