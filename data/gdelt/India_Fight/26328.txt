After Uri, a film on Indian Navy’s daring attack on Karachi harbour in 1971

After the success of Uri: The Surgical Strike, another film on the Indian armed forces is in the pipeline. Based on the daring attacks on the Karachi harbour by Indian Navy in 1971, the film will be produced by Bhushan Kumar, along with Tanuj Garg, Atul Kasbekar and Swati Iyer Chawla, according to a report in Mumbai Mirror.

The report adds that the film will be lavishly mounted. In 1971, during the Indo-Pak war, the Indian Navy attacked the Karachi harbour as part of the Operation Trident, completely decimating the opponent. The operation was commanded by Admiral Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda and took place on the night of December 4 and 5.

Quoting Bhushan Kumar, the report said: “Our navy suffered no losses and caused heavy casualties on the enemy side. It’s an extraordinary tale of strategy, thrill and bravery.” The film is expected to go on floors by mid-2020. The report adds that the film will be directed by ad filmmaker Razneesh Ghai. The film’s script will be finalised by August-September after extensive research.

Speaking about the choice of Razneesh, Tanuj was quoted in the report as saying: “After Ram Madhvani (Neerja) and Suresh Trivedi (Tumhari Sulu), we are launching another leading figure from Indian advertising. He’s an army kid who shot the campaign to commemorate the 84th anniversary of the Indian Air Force and motivate youngsters to reach for the skies. With the panache of his story-telling, I’m sure Razneesh will bring a new approach to the genre.”

Uri: The Surgical Strike, starring Vicky Kaushal and directed by Aditya Dhar, was based on Indian Army’s response to attack on Indian Army brigade headquarters in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists in 2016.
