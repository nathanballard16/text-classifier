This is the second such incident in J&K in a week. A Punjab apple trader and his truck driver were shot by militants in Shopian earlier. The truck was shot dead by two terrorists in Shopian while they thrashed the orchard owner and set ablaze the truck.

Following the incident, the non-local apple traders and truckers were moved to safer locations.

The attack took place hours after the government restored postpaid mobile services in Kashmir. The mobile connections were snapped after the Centre decided to abrogate Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, on August 5.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, terrorists also hurled grenade at a police station in Kulgam during which one civilian was injured.
