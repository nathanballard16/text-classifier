Killings in presence of cops: Activist

JALANDHAR: After procuring information under RTI Act from Haryana government about deployment of police during anti-Sikh riots in November 1984, Manwinder Singh Giaspura of Hondh Chillar Talmel Committee, who had exposed the massacre at Hondh village of Rewari district in which 32 Sikhs were massacred, has alleged that this detail clearly showed that Sikhs and their houses or gurdwaras were targeted only at those places where cops were present.The committee, which is already pursuing the case of massacre at Hondh Chillar, has alleged that later Haryana police under Congress CM Bhajan Lal had closed the FIRs in all these cases in around six months.Providing details procured under RTI about the deployment of police and juxtaposing it with the details of killings of Sikhs and arson during a press conference here, Giaspura said 38 Sikhs were killed at eight places in Gurgaon city alone, three gurdwaras and scores of shops were burnt. “Nine persons were killed in Pataudi in the same district. The RTI data clearly shows that police were deployed at all these places. It is clear that Sikhs were targeted with active connivance of the police as at other places where there were no policemen, Sikhs were not targeted,” he said in the presence of other Coordination Committee members.He said then Haryana CM Bhajan Lal was known for his strong anti-Sikh bias, which he openly displayed during Asian games of 1982, and the FIRs in all these cases were closed in around six months. “Total 79 Sikhs were killed in Haryana during November 1984 but no culprit was ever brought to book and all the cases were closed,” he said.Giaspura alleged that Justice T P Garg Commission, formed to investigate the Hondh Chillar massacre, had recommended action against four police officials but Manohar Lal Khattar government was also going soft. “A petition seeking action against them is pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court but Haryana government has been preferring to get the case delayed on one or other pretext. This behaviour of Khattar government is in contrast to the BJP claim of championing the cause of justice for the victims of November 1984 massacre,” he said.
