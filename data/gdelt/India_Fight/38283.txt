JI rally slams Indian atrocities in Kashmir

TIMERGARA: Jamaat-i-Islami, Lower Dir chapter, held a protest rally against the Indian government for its move to revoke special status to the India-held Kashmir.

The JI workers from different parts of the district gathered and took out a procession from Ahyaul Uloom, Balambat. Carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans in support of Kashmiris, the participants held a procession that ended at Gorgorai Chowk.

JI district chief Izazul Mulk, former provincial minister Muzaffar Syed and JI youth wing district president Farooq Hameedullah spoke on the occasion. They condemned the government of India for changing the special status of Held Kashmir through constitutional amendments.

The speakers urged the UN to take notice of the Indian atrocities in Kashmir. They said that the UN should impose sanctions on India for revoking Article 370. They said the Indian forces had besieged the innocent Kashmiris for the last 70 years and now a conspiracy was being hatched for converting the Muslim majority into minority.
