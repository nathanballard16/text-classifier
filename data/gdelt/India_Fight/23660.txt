All members of Burhan Wani's group eliminated as 3 terrorists killed in Shopian encounter

Security forces in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir have killed three terrorists during an encounter which erupted in the wee hours after specific inputs about their presence in Imam Sahab area of restive Shopian district in south Kashmir.

Sources told WION that a search operation was launched by a joint team of 34 Rashtriya Rifles, a counter-insurgency forces of the Indian army, Jammu and Kashmir police and CRPF. Soon an exchange of fire broke out in which one army man sustained injuries.

The sources added that top Hizb-ul-Mujahideen Commander and the last surviving terrorists of the former Commander Burhan Wani group, Latief Tiger, was among the killed. Apart from him, sources say two other terrorists were also killed including Tariq Moulvi. However, there was no confirmation from the forces about their identity.

The clashes have erupted around the encounter spot between protestors and security forces after the encounter broke out. Mobile internet, train service between Srinagar-Banihal will also remain shut given the situation.

The last leg of Anantnag Lok Sabha election is scheduled to be held in the district on Monday and the encounter has made the situation difficult for the administration. The Election Commission had decided to hold elections in three phases for the one seat, in a first since the independence of India, given the fragile situation in south Kashmir.

All the militants who appeared with Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in a group picture that went viral in 2015, have been killed by forces now. One among them, Tariq Pandit was captured alive by the security forces in 2016.
