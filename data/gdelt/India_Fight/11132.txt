Pune: Alert policemen on patrol duty while the city was fast asleep have averted a major dacoity from being carried out. The incident happened in Pune, on Bopodi Bhau Patil Road, at the Vardhaman Jewellers shop. It happened at 4:00 am, reports Lokmat.

The thieves were attempting to tear open the shutters to the shop when beat marshals Madhav Gopnar and Swapnil Gholap of the Khadki police station arrived there on patrol duty. The thieves had kept their car parked with headlights on and ready to move at short notice. Just then the beat marshals arrived there and saw the men at work outside the jewellery shop, filing away at the shutter locks in a rather suspicious manner.

When the police approached the men, they abandoned their work and ran towards their parked Innova car, one of them firing away at the police. Luckily, no one was hurt but the act gave the thieves a chance to flee with ease. The CCTV footage is unable to provide the car's registration number as the car's headlights shone into the place's CCTV camera in such a way that the glare blinded its lenses, blurring the capture of the registration plate details. Police are probing the case.

A similar incident had taken place in November 2018. The accused fired at the police at the Pune railway station. Police Inspector Gajanan Pawar was injured in this shooting. After the incident, he was immediately taken to a nearby hospital. Pravin Wadekar, a railway police personnel, was also fired upon.
