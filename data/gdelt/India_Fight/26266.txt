EC capitulated before PM Narendra Modi, claims Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: As the Lok Sabha election drew to a close, Congress president Rahul Gandhi led the opposition attack on the Election Commission for allowing PM Narendra Modi ’s Kedarnath visit ahead of the last round of voting. Rahul accused the EC of “surrender” before Modi.“From electoral bonds and EVMs to manipulating the election schedule, NaMo TV, ‘Modi’s Army’ and now the drama in Kedarnath, the Election Commission’s capitulation before Mr Modi and his gang is obvious to all Indians. The EC used to be feared and respected. Not any more,” he tweeted.The Congress attack mirrored the sentiment in the rest of the opposition camp, though not all parties spoke out. TMC complained to the poll panel that Modi’s address to the media at Kedarnath was “unethical” and the media coverage of his visit violated poll norms. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu wrote to chief election commissioner Sunil Arora saying “continuous” telecast of Modi’s “private activities” at the shrines was violation of the poll code.
