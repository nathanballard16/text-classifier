Ahmedabad: In a tragic incident which has come to light from Gujarat, an infant was reportedly mauled to death by a leopard in the Sarasiya range of Gir forest in Amreli district. Officials with the forest department said that the incident took place on Monday when the big cat entered the house of a farmer in the district.

Chief conservator of forests (Junagarh) DT Vasavada told news agency PTI that the leopard took away the two-year-old child from the house in Gopalam village on Monday. The animal entered the house and ran away with the child in his grasp, added Vasavada. The boy's grandfather witnessed the incident and summoned locals for help. Upon hearing a commotion, the big cat left the child and ran away. Unfortunately, the infant had passed away by that time.

An official with the forest department in the area told media personnel that efforts are underway to capture the animal. Cages are being placed across the area to trap the animal, he added.

A similar incident was reported from Gujarat's Chhota Udaipur district in July of last year when a fully-grown leopard attacked a couple and their child near Raipur village in Pavi Jetpur tehsil. The victims were reportedly travelling on a motorcycle at the time of the attack. It was only after bystanders raised an alarm that the big cat fled the spot.
