Kejriwal claims credit for rise in Delhi's revenue

New Delhi, Sep 24 : Claiming that the Aam Aamdi Party (AAP) has boosted public confidence in the government, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said here on Tuesday people had started paying more taxes since he came to power as they felt the government was honest.

From Rs 30,000 crore in 2015, the government revenue had increased to nearly Rs 60,000 crore this year, he said during an event at the Talkatora Stadium. In 2010, the revenue collection stood at Rs 25,000 crore, and in the past five years, between 2010 and 2015, it increased Rs 1,000 crore per year, he added.

He said the business community was happy with his government as they were not being harassed with raids. "People are willing to pay taxes as they know an honest government is in charge of Delhi," Kejriwal said.
