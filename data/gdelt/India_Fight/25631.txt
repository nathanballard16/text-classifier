Smriti Irani, Union Textile Minister, while launching a scathing attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, here today called her anti-national, who had no faith in the democracy and was behaving like a dictator. Smriti said that Mamata even refused to respect the Constitution of India.

Addressing an election rally here this afternoon, Irani condemned the politics of violence, which, she said, was being patronised by Mamata Banerjee in her state. She said law and order situation in the West Bengal had gone beyond the control of the state government. This was evident from the yesterday’s incident when TMC workers attacked the roadshow being carried out by BJP president Amit Shah in Kolkata.

She said Mamata had deprived the people of West Bengal of the due share of development from the Union government-funded schemes like medical benefits of up to Rs 5 lakh under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. She said it was on record that the TMC government had withdrawn its consent to the scheme. Likewise, for many other Central schemes, the West Bengal government had not even opted to reply to the letters sent by the Centre.

Irani said the country was safe only in the hands of Narendra Modi under whom the state had scaled new heights in the past five years.

While appreciating the role of Shanta Kumar in taking BJP to new heights in Himachal during his 65-year political stint, she said the party had the highest regard for leaders like Shanta Kumar. Their service to the party could not be forgotten.

Earlier, addressing the election rally, Shanta Kumar said it was his last speech in the election rally as he had already announced retirement from the electoral politics. However, he would continue to serve the people of the state through social service.
