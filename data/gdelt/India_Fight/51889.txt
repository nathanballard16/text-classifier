JNU protests: Delhi Police registers FIR day after clash with students

The Delhi Police has filed an FIR in connection with ongoing protests against increased hostel fees at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

The FIR was registered at the Kishan Garh Police Station under Sections 186 (obstructing a public servant in the discharge of public functions) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code.

On Monday, as Parliament reconvened for its Winter Session, JNU students clashed with the police after they were stopped from marching there.

The students also clashed with the police outside Safdurjung tomb near Jor Bagh. While the students alleged that they were baton-charged by police, top police officials denied having used any force.

Around 30 police personnel and 15 students were injured during the protest, in which thousands of students participated from different universities across Delhi, the police said.

UPROAR IN PARLIAMENT

On Tuesday, Opposition members in the Lok Sabha described the alleged baton-charge by the police as the suppression of students' voices.

In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition leaders raised the issues of police action against JNU students and detentions of political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir.

Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said adjournment notices received from members didn't warrant setting aside listed business.

But the members were unrelenting and continued to raise the issues from their seats. Proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm.
