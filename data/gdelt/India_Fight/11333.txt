All-woman crew that circumnavigated the globe

AHMEDABAD: Battling the notorious Pacific Ocean and the hailstorms and hurricanes in mid-sea, living in a confined space on a 17x5metre boat, battling health concerns, steering their sail boat and making every resource count, the women crew members of INSV Tarini , who circumnavigated the world over a 254-day voyage call it an experience of a lifetime.Six crew members – Lieutenant Commander, Vartika Joshi, along with Lt Commander, Pratibha Jamwai, Lt Commander, Aishwarya Boddapati , Lt Commander P Swathi and Lt Commander, S Vijaya Devi, who took the journey, were in Ahmedabad on Thursday to meet students of the city. Recalling the journey, Swathi, said, “Women recruits in the Indian Navy are usually part of the ground staff and are into administrative roles and not on the seas. To be able to undertake this voyage, we trained for nearly two years before we could actually start our voyage and it was an enriching experience.”“We had a small boat and limited supplies and therefore, we used to literally count the number of biscuits and bottles of water that we have for all possible uses. There were days when we exhausted water and used to collect rain water, boil it and use it for cooking,” she added.
