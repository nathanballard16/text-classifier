Woman injured after taking flaming shot at hotel in Bengaluru

This is the second instance of a customer being injured after consuming such a shot.

A woman sustained injuries after she consumed a flaming drink at a hotel in Whitefield on Friday. She alleged that the fire in the drink caused the glass to break. This is the second instance of a customer being injured after consuming such a shot.

In February this year, a 28-year-old lawyer sustained severe burns while trying a flaming shot at a bar on Residency Road. The Ashoknagar police filed a case of negligence against the staff.

The latest incident took place at 11.30 p.m. on May 3. The victim, Itishri, 42, a senior executive in the airline service industry, from Delhi, was in the city for a conference. She was staying at the hotel for a few days. Her colleague R.C. Panwar, from Gurugram, told the Whitefield police she and her colleagues met for dinner and decided to take the shot.

The bartender asked everyone to close their eyes and gulp it down. Everyone followed his instructions. “However, the victim felt a piece of glass in her mouth and fortunately did not swallow it. She spat it out but it had cut her mouth,” the police said.

The group alleged that the bar manager and other hotel staff were rude to them when they raised a complaint. Mr. Panwar then took his colleague to a hospital after which they approached the police.

Based on the complaint, the Whitefield police have taken up a case against the staff of The Den, on ITPL Main Road, charging them under Sections 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 506 (criminal intimidation) off the Indian Penal Code or allegedly threatening the victim and her friends who complained about their negligence.
