EXCLUSIVE: Sonakshi Sinha off to Jaipur to shoot Dabangg 3 with Salman Khan, will miss Rakshabandhan this year

Sonakshi Sinha has had a really busy 2019 so far. After Kalank, the actress' second film Khandaani Shafakhana released earlier this month. And within two weeks, she has another film lined up. Jagan Shakti's Mission Mangal that stars Shotgun Jr along with Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Taapsee Pannu, Nithya Menen and Kirti Kulhari releases tomorrow. So it has been a whirlwind of a promotional schedule for Sonakshi already.

Says a source, "Sonakshi wrapped up shoot for Bhuj in the meanwhile which is why she had taken a few days off furing the promotional leg of Khandaani Shafakhana. She tried her best to be present for most of the Mission Mangal promotions. Now, she has already committed her dates to Dabangg 3 and she will fly to Jaipur from Delhi tonight." She had confirmed the same to us during our interactions for the movie.

The source adds, "The third schedule of Dabangg 3 begins right now. Salman Khan and Sonakshi Sinha will be shooting in Rajasthan for the next few weeks. Mahesh Manjrekar's daughter Saiee Manjrekar will also join the duo. She couldn't get a breather in between and now that the Jaipur schedule begins tomorrow, she will also be missing the rakhi celebrations at home." For the unversed, Sonakshi has two brothers Luv Sinha and Kush Sinha.
