"Yesterday night at Delhi when an engineer was doing a routine technical examination of an empty aircraft (777), APU auto shut down took place. Airport fire personnel observed black fumes from the APU exhaust and believing it to be a fire hazard sprayed APU and part of the fuselage with foam spray," a statement released by Air India on Thursday read.

They added, "After this event, APU was examined by opening its cowlings and there was no trace of any burn or external damage noticed except for the minor oil leaks traces, which was normal. A detailed inspection is going."

This is not the first mishap of an Air India aircraft. In October 2018, an Air India flight travelling from Tiruchirappalli to Dubai had unknowingly hit the perimeter wall while take-off. The pilots in the flight came to know of the incident when they were over the Arabian Sea. They had to turn back and make an emergency landing in Mumbai to repair the damage caused to the underside of the flight.
