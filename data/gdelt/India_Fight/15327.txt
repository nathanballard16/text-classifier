Man injured in NZ attack recovering

Ahmed Iqbal Jahangir, the 35-year-old man who was injured in the terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, is recovering, his family said on Saturday.

Mr Jahangir was one of the dozens injured when a gunman opened fire in the mosque. “My brother was operated upon on Friday. A second surgery has been rescheduled for Monday,” Mohammed Khursheed, the victim’s elder brother who lives in Hyderabad, said. Mr Jahangir’s family is by his side in the hospital. Sources close to the family said Mohammed Tanveer, the victim’s sibling, a resident of Australia, reached New Zealand and is with Mr Jahangir.

A video clip shared by the family shows the injured victim being treated in a New Zealand hospital. Mr Tanveer is seen speaking to him, assuring him that his family is doing well. He then tells Mr Jahangir to convey his regards to their mother, a resident of Hyderabad, after which the victim is seen waving his hand slowly.

Meanwhile, Mr Khursheed said the New Zealand embassy had granted visas to him and his mother Shamsunnisa Begum on Saturday. The visas, he said, were a welcome move and would allow her see her son.

The mother-son duo are scheduled to depart from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport on a late night Singapore Airlines flight. “Soon my mother and I will be with my brother. I wish to thank Mr Asaduddin Owaisi who has given us his full support and brought our situation to the notice of the Ministry of External Affairs. The Ministry has been in touch with me throughout. I wish to thank them,” Mr Khursheed said.

It came to light on Saturday, after The Hindu spoke to Telangana Jagruthi New Zealand, that the treasurer of Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch is from Kodad. “Mr Mohammed Abdul Aleem, who is the treasurer of the mosque, is safe. He was unhurt,” said TJNZ president Jyothi Muddam.
