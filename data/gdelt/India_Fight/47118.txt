Ramesh, in the note found, stated that he was distrubed by the I-T raids and that’s the reason behind his extreme step, the police said.

Mr. Parameshwara, who visited the spot, told the media: “Ramesh has been working with me since 2010 and he is like friend more than a staff. He was with me when the I-T officials came to meet me at in Koratagere on October 9. The officials brought us to Bengaluru and took him home for questioning.
