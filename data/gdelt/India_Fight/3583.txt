Rajkummar Rao: Anurag Basu is a genius & magician as he can transform the actors into something different

After Ayushmann Khurrana, 2018 has been lucky for another actor and that being Rajkummar Rao. After the roaring success of Stree, having entered Rs 100 crore club, little did Rajkummar Rao know that his life is going to take a U-turn with filmmakers wanting to sign him for their next projects and amid all the array of directors, Rajkummar Rao zeroed in on Anurag Basu. Yes, Rajkummar Rao and Anurag Basu are working together for an untitled project in 2019 and talking about the same, Rajkummar told Deccan Chronicle, “It was great and something new. I feel Anurag Basu is a genius, he is a magician as he can transform the actors into something different,” adding, “I am fortunate to collaborate with him in two films. The kind of sensibility that he shows on screen is something not many people can do. I don’t want to reveal much about my character. Just wait for the right time.”

Recently, Rajkumar Rao and Dangal fame Fatima Sana Sheikh were shooting in Bhopal for Basu’s film and just like 2018, this actor, who has swayed us with his brilliant performances in films such as Trapped, Fanney Khan, Love Sonia, and Aligarh, among others, wants 2019 also to be his year. “I want every year to be mine. 2018 has been great and I have some great line up in 2019. All my films are different from each other and as an actor, I want to give something to our industry which will be remembered forever,” informs Rao.
