Local people captured the man and handed him over to the police.

The incident occurred in a government-run school at Ambapada village in Niali block when the accused entered the classroom and attacked the teacher with a dagger, police said.

The teacher, a married woman of the same village, suffered grievous injuries in her hand, head and abdomen.

She was first taken to a nearby hospital from where she was shifted to the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack as her condition deteriorated, police said.

The accused, also a resident of Ambapada, had run away from the school campus with the blood-stained weapon in hand.
