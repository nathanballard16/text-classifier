South Korean dies in glider crash

A 45-year-old South Korean national was killed when his glider crashed during an event near Panchgani in Maharashtra's Satara district, over 100 kms from here, police said Wednesday.

The deceased Sang Teak Oh was a professional paraglider, a police officer said.

On Tuesday evening, Sang Oh took off from Rajpuri near Panchgani, the famous hill station located in the Sahyadri mountain ranges in western Maharashtra, but strayed the course and descended into forest areas, he said.

"As per the information received by us, the glider after taking off from Rajpuri, strayed away and slid down into the forest areas," the Satara police officer said.

He said a rescue team present at the event rushed to the spot where Sang Oh's glider collapsed.

"They found Sang Oh with serious injuries and rushed him to a hospital in Wai, around 25 kms away, where he succumbed to his injuries," he said.

The paragliding event was organised by a Mumbai-based firm.

"We have registered a case against the event firm and arrested its event manager Vistas Kharas under IPC section 304 (A) (Causing death by negligence)," the officer said.

Sang Oh's body was handed over to the Korean embassy after postmortem, he said.

Satara superintendent of police Pankaj Deshmukh said Sang Oh's last rites will be performed in Wai as his family members have given their consent.

Sang Oh came to India on a tourist visa. He came to Wai on February 10.

Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders---a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.
