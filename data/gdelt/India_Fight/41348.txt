Rajrani, an 88-year-old woman drug dealer, who was arrested in Delhi on Wednesday.

Delhi Police on Wednesday arrested the oldest drug peddler in the national capital, an 88-year-old woman named Rajrani, who has been in the drug business for decades.

After the death of her husband who owned this business initially, Rajrani took over in the 1990s and since 1996 she has been arrested three times by the Delhi Police.

On Wednesday, Rajrani was arrested from a small locality in west Delhi's Inderpuri after the police laid out a trap for her. Police had received a tip off that Rajrani and her associates who assist her to move around because of her age and failing health would be returning to their Inderpuri residence after receiving a delivery of 16 grams of heroin.

According to DCP (West) Monika Bhardwaj, police raided the house and arrested Rajrani and found heroin in her possession. She was in touch with drug dealers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, police said.

The woman, who is accustomed to going to jail, is well aware of laws of the land and manages to secure a bail every time.

However, Rajrani has a sad story behind this life of drug peddling, reported the Times of India.

During interrogation, Rajrani told the police that she was married at a very young age and had seven children along with her husband, who was a drug dealer. Six of her children died either due to drug abuse or some accident.

Police have registered a case against Rajrani under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the Excise Act.
