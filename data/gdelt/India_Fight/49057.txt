HC dismisses case filed against Nungambakkam

The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a writ petition filed by R. Paramasivan, father of youngster Ram Kumar who was accused of hacking to death Infosys employee S. Swathi at Nungambakkam railway station in Chennai, in June 2016, against making of a movie titled Nungambakkam.

Justice T. Raja refused to entertain the case at the admission stage itself. In his affidavit, the petitioner stated that he belonged to a Scheduled Caste. He said, the false implication of his son in the murder case and the youngster’s death inside prison on September 18, 2016 had become a sensational issue. Though the police claimed it to be a case of suicide by biting a live electric wire, the petitioner was unwilling to buy that claim. Stating that he had been struggling hard to unearth the truth behind the woman’s murder and his son’s death, the making of a movie on the issue might spoil such efforts, he claimed.

However, a government counsel told the court that Ram Kumar was arrested for murder only on the basis of CCTV footage recovered by the police. After recording the submission, the judge decided to dismiss the case.
