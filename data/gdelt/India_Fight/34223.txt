The rise of Marc Benioff, the bombastic Salesforce CEO and owner of Time Magazine, who has a $6.5 billion fortune and owns a 5-acre compound in Hawaii (CRM)

It seems like Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff never leaves the spotlight.

Between Salesforce's Dreamforce mega-conference in San Francisco, his philanthropy , and his willingness to take political stands, it seems like he's always in the spotlight even if, sometimes, it's because he's facing protests over Salesforce's work with the United States Customs and Border Patrol.

Salesforce itself is in a good position at the moment: Under Benioff's leadership, the company has swelled to a $121 billion market cap , even as it hit $10 billion in annual revenue for the 2018 fiscal year. It's gone from an upstart Oracle rival to a cloud computing behemoth in its own right.

Here's how Benioff, whose estimated net worth now stands at $6.5 billion , worked his way up to the national stage from humble origins.

Marc Russell Benioff, 54, was born in San Francisco on September 25th, 1964, the son of Joelle and Russell Benioff.

Benioff is something of an anomaly among Silicon Valley CEOs he was actually born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.

His father, Russell Benioff, owned a local department store in San Francisco. "I learned my work ethic from him," Benioff once said.

Benioff got his first job at a jewelry store to save up for his first computer. He was eventually fired for cleaning the floors with the wrong soap.

While in high school, Benioff sold his first app software called "How To Juggle" for the TRS-80 Model 1 computer to a computer magazine for $75.

At age 15, Benioff founded Liberty Software, his one-man company making games for the Atari 800 computer. Titles included "King Arthurs Heir," "The Nightmare," "Escape from Vulcans Isle," and "Crypt of the Undead."

By age 16, Benioff was pulling in $1,500 a month enough that he was able to pay for his own tuition at the University of Southern California. He graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration in 1986.

While at USC, Benioff took a summer internship with Apple, working as a programmer in the Macintosh division under cofounder Steve Jobs. "That summer, I discovered it was possible for an entrepreneur to encourage revolutionary ideas," Benioff would later write.

Jobs became one of Benioffs mentors. There would be no Salesforce.com without Steve Jobs, Benioff said in 2013.

Benioff planned to stay in programming for the rest of his career, but a USC professor suggested he might have a mind for business. And so, he took a customer support role at high-flying database company Oracle right out of college.

Young Benioff rapidly made it up the ranks. At age 23, Benioff was named Oracles "Rookie of the Year."

While at Oracle, Benioff caught the attention of its billionaire playboy founder Larry Ellison. The two became very close, with Ellison mentoring the younger Benioff.

After 13 years with Oracle, Benioff started itching for something new. With Ellisons permission, Benioff took a sabbatical to travel the world. He spent part of that time studying meditation in Hawaii.

Benioff came up with the idea for Salesforce while swimming with dolphins. He soon started working on the company with a few other Oracle veterans.

The big idea behind Salesforce was that where most companies including Oracle sold enterprise software that companies had to install on their own servers, they would let people access business apps from the web browser. For the late nineties, this was revolutionary.

At first, Ellison was supportive of Benioff. Ellison even gave Salesforce $2 million in funding from his own pocket to get it started, and sat on its board of directors.

But things turned sour between the two. Benioff found out that Oracle was working on a direct competitor to Salesforce. Benioff tried to force his mentor to quit the companys board. Instead, Ellison forced Benioff to fire him meaning Ellison kept his shares in Salesforce.

Salesforce has gotten so big, that at one point, the company had to abandon plans to move into a new San Francisco campus, because it had already outgrown it. Instead, it opened Salesforce Tower, its new headquarters and the tallest building in San Francisco in 2018.
