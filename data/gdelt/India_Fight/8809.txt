Ajay Devgn (L), Sridevi

Ahead of Sridevi’s first death anniversary on February 24, Ajay Devgn remembered the screen legend in an exclusive conversation with ZoomTV.com. The actor, who is gearing up for the release of his adventure comedy film Total Dhamaal, said that Sridevi’s loss was irreplaceable.

Ajay shared with us, “I have never worked with her but since my childhood, I was in awe of her for the kind of actor that she was. From whatever interactions I had with her, I know the kind of human being that she was and I do not think anybody can replace her in the industry. Like I earlier also said, it is a loss which will never be filled up.”

Watch:

Sridevi was in Dubai at the time of her death, where she had gone to attend the wedding of her nephew, actor Mohit Marwah. She was accompanied by her husband Boney Kapoor and younger daughter Khushi. The couple’s elder daughter Janhvi was in Mumbai then shooting for her debut film Dhadak.

Sridevi was found dead in her hotel washroom. The Dubai Forensic Department revealed “accidental drowning” as the cause of her death. Traces of alcohol were reportedly found in the actress’ body.

Back in India, the untimely and tragic demise received heavy media coverage. Outright absurd theories surrounding Sridevi’s death did rounds on social media before the forensic reports finally ruled out foul play.

Almost a year after the horrific episode, the nation is yet to come to terms with the fact that their beloved ‘Hawa Hawai’ is no more.
