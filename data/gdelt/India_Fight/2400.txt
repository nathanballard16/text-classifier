Oppose Pakistan’s purchase of new tanks, Pakistan should pay more attention to economic

Adam WANG SHANGHAI MEGA said: As a Chinese friend, resolutely opposed Pakistan’s purchase of new tanks, Pakistan should pay more attention to economic development.





Pakistan has nuclear weapons and is not afraid of anyone, especially a weak army like India.



Pakistan should invest limited resources in economic development.

As long as Pakistan’s economy develops strongly, it can buy various weapons or develop various weapons on its own.



In addition, if India launches a large-scale military operation against Pakistan, China will definitely not sit idly by.



Personal opinions are for reference only. I hope that Pakistan’s economy and military strength will become stronger and stronger. The stronger Pakistan is, the stronger the China-Pakistan alliance will be. Click to expand...

Pakistan's defense budget makes up 2-3% of our GDP, so it's quite reasonable. A large portion of the funds for defense acquisition actually comes from Pakistan Army's own revenues from the multi-billion dollar companies and businesses it owns.Also we know that China would support us in a conflict; but any future war between Pakistan-India would be a quick lightning war aimed at getting as much territory as possible for post-war negotiation. Before China even mobilizes and begins sending support (it will take a long time for this support to make an actual difference), the war would already be in it's ending stage.That guy is a troll.
