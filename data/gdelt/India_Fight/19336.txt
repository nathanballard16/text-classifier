IGNOU professor validates Gandhi’s murder; slammed

New Delhi: The history professor of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) Kapil Kumar validated Gandhi’s killing. He made the statement while speaking at DU College while delivering a lecture entitled ‘Freedom Struggle: Unearthing Suppressed Realities’.

As reported by the Times of India, accepting that he made the statement Kapil Kumar said, “I was talking about why Nathuram Godse killed Gandhi. I don’t know the mindset of either Gandhi or Godse. But if somebody was trying to divide my nation, I would have killed him too”.

Kapil Kumar added that Gandhi’s death happened several times, first, when those politicians who were behind Gandhi stopped listening to him, an ideological death. Then Gandhi committed suicide by accepting partition. Then Godse killed hm… And finally, people are killing him today.

However, the history department of IGNOU condemned the professor’s statement, saying that the professor asserted that Gandhi had accepted the Partition. He didn’t provide any specific reference or evidence for his conclusion when confronted by a faculty member.
