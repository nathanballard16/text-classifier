80 and spry: But Sheila may find it hard to bowl out Kejriwal

Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Congress has given the reins of the Delhi battle to veteran warhorse Sheila Dikshit. The strategy is to put 15 years of her rule face to face with AAP’s five year tenure.

To recap, in her three term chief ministership Dikshit won laurels for an agenda of development – which may evoke nostalgia among current denizens of the city. A couple of the highlights of her long tenure were that Delhi got a metro rail that’s the envy of the rest of the country and pulled off, after worrying last minute hiccups and multiple corruption charges, the Commonwealth Games. But she also made controversial pronouncements, seeming to blame the capital’s crime problem on migrants, and its women safety challenge on women being ‘adventurous’.

In 2013 she lost her seat to Arvind Kejriwal. In 2014 Congress didn’t win a single Lok Sabha seat. It likewise scored a big zero in the 2015 assembly elections. Reversing this tide is a tall order. No doubt the AAP government has many failures on its record too, but it has also launched several popular initiatives on the ground. Can the Sheila nostalgia card really triumph over these? Or could all this be a Machiavellian setup for a Congress-AAP alliance? In any case, after Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, in Delhi too Congress has chosen to entrust its hopes for a new dawn to an old hand.
