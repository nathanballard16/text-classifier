The accused was wanted by the police of four neighbouring states along with two of his allies. Navpreet Singh, who also went by the name Nav Lahoria's arrest has added a feather in the cap of the police.

Lahoria, along with two of his allies had absconded from an encounter where the police successfully caught two other allies of the accused, namely, Mani Dullar from Patiala and Navneet Singh from Haryana. The encounter happened on Saturday, two days after the leaman and his allies took a resident's car at gunpoint.
