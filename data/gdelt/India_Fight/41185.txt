No rules yet to cut crashes due to high-tension cables

MUMBAI: High-tension power supply wires and cable lines have been the bane of helicopter and small fixed-wing aircraft pilots worldwide, having caused hundreds of fatal accidents. On Tuesday, all the six passengers of a private aircraft which reportedly got entangled in electricity wire and caught fire after hitting the ground had a narrow escape in Aligarh.However, a helicopter accident last week in Uttarkashi, which killed three people, is also believed to have happened because of the power supply wires that went unnoticed by the pilots, until it was too late to recover the aircraft and fly over the obstacle. However, unlike regulators in other countries, India is yet to formulate norms for state governments and power-supply companies, aimed at cutting down the number of wire-strike crashes, say industry experts.“In other countries, like Australia, for instance, the rule is that any transmission company setting up cables, mostly in valleys, should put up markers. Our Directorate General of Civil Aviation doesn’t talk about it,’’ said a senior helicopter pilot. India has about 2.6 lakh circuit km of power transmission lines, apart from other wires and cables that cut across the path of low-flying aircraft and many of these, including those that run through valleys frequently used by helicopters, remain unmarked.Capt Uday Gelli, western region president of Rotary Wing Society of India, said: “We believe that installing aerial marker balls on high-tension wires crisscrossing valleys in northern parts of India should be made mandatory.” An aerial marker ball is a bright orange fibre glass ball, weighing about 20 kgs and about 2-3 feet in diameter, which is installed along the power supply lines to alert pilots about the obstacle in their flight path.“The question remains how long can we continue to accept such accidents wherein helicopters crash into high-tension wires resulting in fatalities. It is time the DGCA sends out a strong message to state governments, the local district administration and power producers laying transmission lines,” said Capt Gelli.Another problem with operating in areas like Uttarakhand Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir is the presence of cable lines put up by villagers over rivers and valleys across hills to transport farm produce.The US Helicopter Safety Team found that approximately 16% of all rotary-wing accidents involve wire or obstacle strikes. The US civil aviation regulator, Federal Aviation Administration , studied 124 wire-strike accidents involving civil helicopters between 1994 and 2004 and found that 86% of fatal accidents occurred in clear weather with good visibility. A study by South African civil aviation authority, following 117 wire-strike accidents between 1990 and 2008, found that attempts to carry out emergency landing, failure to look out for wire due to distractions in the cockpit, poor visibility factors like low clouds, fog and sun contribute to such crashes.Unlike navigation charts used by airline pilots, those used by general aviation pilots aren’t updated regularly and don’t carry all the needed information to prevent wire-strikes. Currently, the only system in place to prevent such crashes in India is through information sharing by pilots. But relying solely on word-of-mouth information regarding hazardous wires and cables in flight paths is hardly serving the purpose.Also, pilot experience plays no role in reducing the chances of such accidents. The Federal Aviation Administration also found that the average age of pilots involved in civilian helicopter wire-strike accidents was 43.5 years, with 78% of the accidents involving pilots between the ages of 40 and 59, and with an average flight experience of 3,575 hours.
