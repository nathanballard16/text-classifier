Maoists’ Bharat Bandh hits life in several districts

The Maoists-called Bharat Bandh on Thursday threw normal life out of gear in several districts of the State. The Red rebels blocked roads by felling trees on National Highway-59 near Pakaladami Ghat disrupting vehicular communications between Balliguda and Daringbadi of Kandhamal district.

The ultras also put up posters and banners on the spot with an aim to trigger panic among the locals. The Maoists also felled trees near Satanalia on Kothaguda-Muniguda road in the district. The ultras also blocked road by felling trees on Fikarkupa-Dhepaguda road in Kalahandi district and torched a JCB engaged in road construction work near Kendu ghati area in the district. Posters opposing the road construction were also recovered from the spot.

In Malkangiri, Government buses stayed off the roads giving a tough time to commuters. Vehicular movement in and around several Maoist-dominated areas including Moupadar and Bejenguda in the district was severely hit due to the bandh.

Security forces were on high alert and intensified combing operations to prevent any untoward incidents.

“The District Voluntary Force (DVF), Border Security Force (BSF) and Special Operations Group (SOG) jawans have stepped up combing operations in the Maoist dominated areas and interior parts of Malkangiri district. Joint operations are also being carried out with the Chhattisgarh and the Andhra Pradesh police. The intelligence networks have also alerted,” said Malkangiri SP Jagmohan Meena.

On the other hand, the Maoists blew up an Improvised Explosive Devise (IED) at Chatikona in Rayagada district in the morning. However, no one was reportedly hurt in the explosion. Police and forensic team rushed to the spot after getting information and recovered another IED.
