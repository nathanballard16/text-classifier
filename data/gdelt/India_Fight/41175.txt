No direct proof: Bombay High Court upholds Jigna Vora's acquittal in J-Dey murder case

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday upheld the acquittal of former journalist Jigna Vora in the sensational J-Dey murder case and stated that there was insufficient evidence against her for the acquittal to be challenged before it.

The high court also said that there was no direct evidence against her, standingby the decision of the trial court that had acquitted the former journalist in May 2018, while convicting Chhota Rajan and eight others for the killing of Jyotirmoy Dey, who was the then crime and investigations editor at Mid-day.

Appearing for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Advocate Pradip Gharat had challenged Vora's acquittal on the grounds that the trial court had accepted the call transcripts of the phone call that Chhota Rajan had made to a real estate broker, who had deposed as witness in the Dey case.

In this transcript, Rajan had claimed that Vora had provided the registration number of Dey's motorcycle.

Gharat had also argued that Vora had gone on a "sudden 10-day leave" just one day before murder as was confirmed by her own HR representative.

Meanwhile, representing Vora, Advocate Meghashyam Kochrekar had argued that there was no direct evidence to connect Vora with Chhota Rajan.

The bench also agreed with the observation of the trial court that a crime journalist speaking to the underworld could not be construed as wrong.

Vora, who had been working as deputy chief of bureau at The Asian Age at the time had been accused of instigating Rajan to eliminate Dey due to professional and personal rivalry. Dey's stories against Rajan is also said to have irked the gangster. The case has been ongoing since 2011, after Dey, 56, was gunned down by motorcycle-borne assailants in November near his Powai residence.
