Immediately after the Pulwama attack, Pakistan ordered all terrorists of the Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Hizbul Mujahideen to shut down terror camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. This was done in anticipation of a major strike by India.

The terrorists were ordered to be moved into the Balakot camp, which is in a densely forested area and is spread across nearly 7 kilometres. The movement of the terrorists into Balakot began immediately after the Pulwama attack.

This was in a way a blessing for the security agencies, who went on to target a large number of terrorists in one operation that was carried out by the Indian Air Force. There were a large number of terrorists present at Balakot at the time of the strike. Sources tell Oneindia that at least 300 terrorists including their top commanders and trainers have died in the strike.
