Bharat: Salman-Katrina shoot for a wedding number

For a long time, the most asked question to superstar Salman Khan is the one about his long impending marriage. He is often asked this question by the media, fans and at several shows, he appears in. Not just that, his wedding has also become a part of pop culture jokes. Well, there is still no date or confirmation about his wedding and it seems like Salman Khan has no plans of tying the knot in near future.

But, later this year, fans will witness his wedding with Katrina Kaif on Eid. Before you get any idea, Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif are currently shooting for their new film Bharat. In the movie, the two will be seen getting married according to the reports and are currently busy shooting for a wedding sequence and a song. If you remember, when Salman Khan had appeared on the new season of The Kapil Sharma Show, he had stated that his character doesn't get married until he is 72 years old in the movie.

The song is being choreographed by Vaibhavi Merchant. Divulging few details about it, a source told DNA, "There are several tracks in the film, featuring on different actors but the one that’s being shot right now is a wedding number. It’s an upbeat song that gives out the festival feel as well. A lot of flowers and other decorations are being used. This will also be Salman and Kat’s second song in the film, after the one they shot in Malta."

Apart from Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, Bharat also stars Disha Patani, Tabu, Jackie Shroff and Sunil Grover.
