PHOTOS: 1st spell of monsoon shower submerges Mumbai

Mumbaikars woke up to heavy rains, ending a long dry spell, but a few hours of incessant showers left the financial capital struggling with familiar monsoon woes of waterlogging, delayed trains, traffic jams and choked drains.

Eight people were killed and five injured in rain-related incidents across Maharashtra where several parts were lashed by heavy rains on Friday.

In Palghar in Maharashtra, an eight-year-old boy died after being struck by lightning while two farm labourers were killed in Akola. Two persons, including a teenage girl, were killed in rain-related incidents in Nashik district which was lashed by heavy showers for the fourth consecutive day.

In Mumbai, three persons were killed and five injured in rain-related incidents.

The metropolis was lashed by the first spell of heavy rains this monsoon that marked its most delayed arrival in the city in 45 years.
