Friend in need: Kashmiri fruit grower tends to critically injured Punjabi fruit buyer at Srinagar hospital

SRINAGAR: Parvaiz Ahmed, a fruit grower from south Kashmir ’s Shopian district , was travelling with fruit buyer Charanjit Singh and his friend Sanjay Charya from Punjab when two terrorists opened fire at the trio’s fruit-laden truck in Shopian’s Trenz area late on October 16. While Charanjit was killed and Sanjay critically injured in the attack, Parvaiz managed to escape unscathed.Since then, he hasn’t left Sanjay’s side and is tending to him at Srinagar ’s SMHS hospital day and night.The 25-year-old Shopian resident is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that Sanjay, also 25, recovers soon. “Sanjay suffered a bullet injury in his chest and is battling for life. I am here to take care of him,” Parvaiz said.“I have known Sanjay for the last two years, but my family has had business relations with him for the last eight years. For me, he is a brother and a family friend,” said Parvaiz, who is bearing all the expenses of his friend’s treatment, although the deputy commissioner has released Rs 50,000 for the purpose.Narrating the fateful evening of October 16, Parvaiz said, “Sanjay was left unattended for about 10 minutes after being shot. He had sustained bullet injuries on his arm and right side of the chest. I first took him to a nearby hospital and later to Srinagar’s SMHS hospital.”Touched by the humane gesture, Sanjay’s father Jaspal Charya said they have no words to thank Parvaiz for his goodwill. Sanjay’s uncle Subash said, “He has been with us since October 16 and was the one who informed us about the attack.”
