Pakistan approves Indian PM Modi's request to fly over its airspace

ISLAMABAD - Pakistan has allowed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plane to fly over its airspace, it emerged on Wednesday.

According to details, the Indian PM had requested authorities in Pakistan to let his plane fly over its airspace, carrying him to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Kyrgyzstan.

Islamabad formally granted the permission as a goodwill gesture amid tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours that have clashed in recent months.

However, after Pakistan allowed PM Modi's overflight through its air space, the Indian premier decided not to use the option, rather he would fly over via Iran or Oman, claimed editor of The Hindu.
