Faridabad, October 28

The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) and the deadline for bursting crackers remained ineffective on Diwali as air quality dipped to its worst. The PM 2.5 level was recorded at 500 at 11 pm, eight times more than the safe level of 60.

The PM 2.5, which improved to 336 at 8 am on Monday morning, shot to 358 in the evening as smog that enveloped the atmosphere since Monday night continued throughout the day.

“The time limit for bursting crackers was 10 pm, but it had no impact on majority of people who continued to burst crackers till midnight,” said Pinaki Ranjan, a resident of Sector 86 here.

The situation worsened when cracker waste was put on fire at some of the places on Monday morning. A heavy smoke emitted from a heap of garbage in Sector 17 which, according to city resident was a violation of norms.
