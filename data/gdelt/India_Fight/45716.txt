New Delhi, October 1

Pakistan’s reshuffle of its diplomats in crucial positions suggests its clash with India over the Kashmir lockdown will be relocated to world capitals after the curtain came down in the UN General Assembly’s high-level segment in New York on Monday.

Constantly seen by Pakistan Prime Minster Imran Khan’s elbow during the time he spent at the UN headquarters, Maleeha Lodhi was suddenly put out to pasture on Monday night. A Pakistan Foreign Office announced the replacement of its most high-profile diplomat this past week as part of several changes in the world capitals.

There is no official word over whether Lodhi’s replacement happened because it was overdue or because of displeasure by the Pakistan PM. But there are two other equally intriguing changes — one is of the Pakistan Counsel General in Houston, the site of the hugely successful Howdy Modi rally, and the second of the Permanent Representative in Geneva where Pakistan was unable to muster support for its resolution against India at the UN Human Rights Council.

Sources here said so far two threads have emerged after the frenzied diplomacy at the UNHRC and UNGA failed to meet Islamabad’s expectations. The first: far from internationalising the dispute, India has simply been asked to take care of the human rights aspect while handling Kashmir. Second is the world community unanimous in asking Pakistan to keep cross-border terrorism in check.
