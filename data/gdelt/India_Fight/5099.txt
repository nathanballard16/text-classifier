Lucknow, February 8

A Muzaffarnagar court today sentenced all seven persons convicted of killing two cousins in Jansath town to life imprisonment. The incident is believed to have triggered the 2013 communal riots in the district.

On February 6, Additional District Judge Himanshu Bhatnagar had held the seven guilty of the August 27, 2013, killing of cousins Sachin and Gaurav.

Today, the ADJ pronounced life sentence for all seven. They are Mujassim and Muzammil, both sons of Naseem; Furqaan, Jahangir, Nadim, Afzal and Iqbal.

While the others have been behind bars since 2013, Iqbal and Afzal, who had been granted bail by the High Court, were taken into custody soon after they were convicted two days ago.

In 2013, Gaurav's cycle had crashed into the motorcycle of Kanwal village residents Shahnawaz and Mujassim, leading to an argument that escalated to the murder of the cousins. Shahnawaz was also killed during the fracas.

After the incident, Gaurav's father Ravinder Singh had lodged a case at the Jansath police station against Mujassim and Muzammil, Furqaan, Jahangir, Nadim, Afzal, Iqbal and deceased Shahnawaz. Shahnawaz's father Salim lodged a counter-FIR against five relatives of Gaurav and Sachin. After the constitution of an SIT, an FIR was also filed into Shahnawaz's killing.

SIT's investigating officer Sampoornanand Tiwari, probing the killing of Gaurav and Sachin, presented a charge-sheet in court on November 24, 2013. The trial started on April 15, 2014.

During the nearly five-year trial, the prosecution presented 10 witnesses, while six witnesses appeared on behalf of the defence.

Around 65 people were killed in the communal violence that followed, engulfing Muzaffarnagar and neighbouring Shamli and Baghpat districts.
