64 year old man kills wife daughter in law arrested

On Friday morning, a 64-year-old private school teacher brutally stabbed his 62-year-old wife and 35-year-old daughter-in-law after he suspected them of having illicit affair. Police said that Satish Chaudhary, 64, allegedly killed Pragya Chaudhary (35), wife of his son Gaurav Chaudhary who is a software engineer in Singapore; and his 62-year-old wife Snehlata Chaudhary at their home in Rohini. "The retired teacher has been arrested and a case has been registered at the Vijay Vihar police station," said Shank Dhar Mishra, DCP Rohini. This is the second case resulting in double murder and murder and suicide in the same district of Delhi within a span of two days. Initial probe suggests that the doctor first shot his employee and then shot himself dead.
