National Call for 2 minutes Silence on Gandhiji’s Martyrdom Day

The National Call for 2 minutes Silence at 11.00am & 5.17 pm is being held from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kohima to Kutch! The National Initiative to Commemorate the Martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi is now a People’s Movement! ———————————————————————————————————————————- Mumbai: Silent March from Mani Bhavan to August KrantiMaidan. We will Commemorate, pay homage and stand in Silence for 2 minutes at 5.17pm. · Sarva Dharma Prarthana, Inter-Faith Prayer meeting. · Take a Pledge for Communal Harmony, Peace and Non-Violence. · In the morning at 11.00am, similar programmes are being held in various schools, colleges, community centres and religious places across the city & across all of India.

It is during the course of the 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations, that we will also mark the 71st anniversary of the Martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our nation, the apostle of Harmony, Peace and Non-Violence. Gandhiji was a victim of an assassin, indoctrinated by an ideology of hatred and communal divisiveness, an ideology that is detrimental to and opposed to the very idea of a secular, democratic, modern India. Again as our nation is faced with a crisis, it’s time to recall the man and his message.

Thus during the course of the last few months, various Gandhian, Socialist, Leftist and Ambedkarite organisations have come together to appeal for a nationwide call to observe the solemn day. We have also reached out to and coordinating with various Trade Unions & Political Parties across the country, so as to make this a call that will reach out to crores and crores of Indians. We have also reached out to the people of every religion, language and culture. Our objective is to ensure that the call reaches out to the masses, to every home, school, college, field, factory, office, shop and pheriwala in our country.

Political Initiative: Our intention in reaching out to political parties was to ensure that the coming 30th of January, the Day of Gandhiji’s martyrdom, would be a day when Crores and Crores of ordinary Indians would be aware and actively participate in commemorating and remembering the message of the Mahatma. We thus decided to reach out to both social movements and thus contacted & met secular political parties across the spectrum & included leaders from the Congress, NCP, CPI, CPM, SP, BSP, CPI-ML, JDS, RJD, LJD, that even as the process carries on.

Thus as one can clearly see, that the coming Martyrs Day is indeed a spontaneous commemoration on the part of the People, from Students, Workers, Farmers, from people across all religions and regions of India. Needless to say, that our nation is facing a major challenge, where the very IDEA of INDIA is at stake, our very Constitutional Democracy under threat from regressive communal forces. Thus it’s time once again, to remember the Mahatma, the man and his teachings.
