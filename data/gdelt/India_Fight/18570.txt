Congress picks a political neophyte to fight Jardosh

SURAT: Congress has pitted a political novice to take on the might of BJP candidate Darshana Jardosh, who won from the Surat seat with a massive 5 lakh margin in 2014 and is seeking a second term.Ashok Adhevada, 46, is a diamond trader who also has interest in construction business, will debut in the hustings this time, despite his 16 years of association with the grand old party and holding the post of secretary in the pradesh Congress set up. Though observers feel that him being from Gohilwad worked in his favour, the man himself claims that he was offered the mandate by party high command owing to the backing he received from a large number of Varachha-based social organizations. Moreover, with no local Surat cadre seeking ticket for the seat, Adhevada at least won the ticket battle uncontested!Talking to TOI, he said: “I have full confidence in our local Surat Congress team and I am fighting this elections with the blessings of Surat people. We will turn the past defeats into victory this time with our hard work.”Settled in Surat for the past 16 years, Adhevada is controversy free and holds a low key profile. Not many would recognize him easily on the streets. Diamond worker from Varachha, Suresh Navadia said, “I know that Adhevada is a village in our Bhavnagar district , but I haven’t heard about Ashok Adhevada. I may not recognize his face too.” Navadia is not the only one to be surprised.However, Adhevada is unperturbed by such reactions.“I have worked in the party since the beginning and I know that once we start moving in the city areas, people will know me better. In the next 10 days we will start a programme titled human chain building where we hope to connect with more than 15 lakh households of Surat,” said Adhevada.He highlighted issues of textile industry subsidy, GST, lack of proper transportation system in city.
