Expressing condolences to Chaudhary’s family, the Congress Party on Thursday said it was deeply angered and saddened by this act of grotesque violence against a member of the party and urged the Haryana government to bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest.

Speaking on the daylight murder, Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar termed Manohar Khattar rule in Haryana “jungle raj”. Demanding a thorough investigation, Tanwar said there is no fear of law in the state and a similar incident happened on Wednesday when a woman, who opposed molestation bid, was stabbed by unknown people.

More details are awaited.
