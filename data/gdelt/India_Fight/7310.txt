FCB Ulka and ScoopWhoop invite women for 'symbolic' trip to Sabarimala Temple

Sharing her perceptive on the campaign, Swati Bhattacharya, CCO, FCB Ulka says, “It is so heartening to see that all the issues we ignited with Sindoor Khela are gaining such momentum in the country! What happened at Sabarimala or the Kinnar Akhada’s debut at the Kumbh Mela just imply that time’s up! Things do need to happen in a fair and free manner for women. And this is what happens when you tell a woman you can’t go there, or you can’t do that!”
