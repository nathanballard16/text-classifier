Man who opened fire in school identified

Ludhiana: A day after a teacher reprimanding a student led to violence in Gag Kalan village of Sidhwan Bet, Ludhiana rural police have identified two of the accused. The police said Bitta of Khurshaidpur in Ludhiana district had opened fire on the gathering. The cops, however, didn’t divulge the name of the other identified accused.

On Tuesday, two groups, one supporting the teacher and other the student, had come to blows. In the melee, unidentified accused fired three to four gunshots, of which one hit Daljeet Singh of Tudyad in Dharmkot, Moga. Besides, Manjeet Singh of Khurshaidpur was hit on the head with a rod.

DSP Gurdeep Singh said only two accused have been identified so far, but they were yet to be arrested. He said the weapon used by the accused, Bitta, was illegal.

However, even after 24 hours of the incident, the police have not registered an FIR. Cops said the two injured were declared unfit by doctors to give their statement. They added that now they would be registering a case on the statement of their relatives. A police officer said it was yet to be ascertained if the accused who had opened fire was on the teacher’s side or the student’s.

It all started when the teacher asked the student to leave his classroom a few days ago. A cop said, “Jasvir Singh, who teaches at Senior Secondary School, Gag Kalan, had scolded the Class XII student and asked him to leave the classroom. As the matter snowballed into a controversy, the education department sent an official to the school to sort it out.”

On Tuesday, the education department official was holding a meeting with the village panchayat, the student’s family and the schoolteachers on the campus when the two groups, who were waiting outside, had a heated argument that later led to violence.
