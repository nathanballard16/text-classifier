Bengaluru: The BJP can take power in Karnataka “within 24 hours” if it wins 22 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, the party’s state chief BS Yeddyurappa said.

However, BJP currently has 16 seats of Karnataka’s 28 parliamentary seats.

"I am not telling you this is out of audacity. If the people of Karnataka give us 22 seats in the coming Lok Sabha elections, we will form the government in Karnataka within 24 hours," Yeddyurappa bragged at a public meeting on Sunday.

Yeddyurappa has often been in the news over his pronouncements while campaigning for 2019 national elections.

Last month, BJP state chief said that Indian Air Force’s air strike in Balakot would help BJP to win 22 seats in Karnataka.

Yeddyurappa was sworn in as chief minister soon after the Karnataka elections last year in May. He was forced to resign as the BJP was short of the majority mark of 111 in the state assembly.

Later, JD(S) and Congress formed an alliance to form the government.
