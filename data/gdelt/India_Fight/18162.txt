New Delhi, April 1

Tensions continue between India and Pakistan as the Indian Air Force on Monday scrambled two Sukhoi-30 fighter jets after sighting a Pakistani drone and a group of four F-16 fighter jets along the Indo-Pak border in the Khemkaran sector of Punjab.

Though sources confirmed the development, the IAF spokesperson refused to comment on the matter.

Sources said the Sukhoi-30 MKI jets were deployed soon after a Pakistani unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was seen hovering over the border, and the F-16s were close by.

The drone retreated to the Pakistani side after the Indian jets were scrambled. Both sides continue to have combat air patrols, testing each other’s nerves. UAVs of both countries have been noticed hovering in ‘enemy’ territory.

Post the Balakot airstrikes on February 26 and the air duel a day later, there have been a series of incidents of Pakistani drones coming close to the Indo-Pak border.

A UAV which intruded into Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar sector was shot down by the Army. Another drone was shot down in Bikaner sector. — TNS
