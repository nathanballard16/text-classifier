According to the Hindustan Times' report, the murder took place at 6 am on Sunday. The deceased was standing with a female friend of his in an open ground situated near a labour camp in Kharadi.

This prompted a fight between them and the accused allegedly hit Singh on his head with a stone.

While talking to HT, Krishna Indalkar, a senior police officer, stated that after the alleged fight, both the parties parted ways. On reaching home, the victim took a bath and soon after, he started vomiting. He then went to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared him dead.
