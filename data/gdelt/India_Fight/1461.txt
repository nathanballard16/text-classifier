India news: Nurse decapitates unborn baby tries to hide evidence

A nurse at an Indian hospital has pulled the head off a baby during birth, according to reports.

On January 6, pregnant Dikhsha Kanwar was admitted to the government-run Ramgarh Community Health Centre, in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer district, when she began having contractions.

During the birth, it is understood the baby was in breech and when a nurse attempted to pull it out, he ripped the child’s body in two from the torso down, leaving the head inside Ms Kanwar’s womb.

It is alleged two nurses in the medical team, Amritlal Singh and Juhjar Singh, hid the child’s headless body in the medical centre’s mortuary and advised one of the hospital’s doctors that they had finished Ms Kanwar’s delivery but there was a problem delivering the placenta.

She was then transferred to Ummed Hospital in nearby Jodhpur, where doctors thinking they were recovering the placenta, were shocked to discover the foetus’ dismembered head.

According to the Hindustan Times, this was the first time Ms Kanwar and her husband were told what had happened.

Both men have been suspended and an internal investigation is currently underway.

“When questioned, the hospital staffers handed over the lower part of the foetus to us,” investigating officer Jalam Singh said in a statement.

Dr Nikhil Sharma, the head of the Ramgarh Community Health Centre, said he was not present when Ms Kanwar was admitted to the facility and the two nurses allegedly conducted the delivery unsupervised.

No arrests have been made, although Ms Kanwar’s family have filed a formal complaint about the two nurses.
