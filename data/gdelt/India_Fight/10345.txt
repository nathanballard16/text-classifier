Flight operations suspended from Amritsar

Commercial flight operations were suspended on Wednesday from the Guru Ram Das Jee International airport in Amritsar amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan.

Passengers who were in the Amritsar airport terminal to catch flights for various destinations were asked to leave the building.

The Army, Indian Air Force (IAF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel took control of the airport complex.

"We were inside the airport to catch an international flight. We were asked to leave. We do not know the fate of our flight. No one is telling us anything," a young woman who was to leave for Dubai said.

The airports at Halwara near Ludhiana and Adampur near Jalandhar, which are both with the Indian Air Force (IAF), were also put on high alert.
