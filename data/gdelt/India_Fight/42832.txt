Pakistani troops also violated ceasefire by resorting to mortar shelling and small arms firing on forward posts and villages along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch district at around 8:15 pm on Saturday.

Tnsions between India and Pakistan have intensified after the Indian Parliament, last month, withdrew the special status that Jammu and Kashmir had been enjoying for last 70 years and bifurcated the border state into two union territories.

Last week, Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had said that Pakistan was escalating efforts to activate terror training camps once again in an attempt to push infiltrators across the Line of Control. The Army chief, however, assured that India was ready for any eventuality, including war if Pakistan heaps it upon us.
