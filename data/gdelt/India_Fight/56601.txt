India’s indigenously developed upgraded Pinaka guided rocket system test-fired

In a major boost to Army’s artillery power, the defence organisation, on Thursday, December 19, successfully test fired an upgraded version of India’s indigenously developed Pinaka guided rocket system.

Developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the system was test-fired on a base on Odisha coast from the Proof and Experimental Establishment firing test range at Chandipur, said the defence sources. Equipped with state-of-the-art guidance kit comprising an advanced navigation and control system, the Pinaka system is all set to significantly boost the capability of the artillery to hit the targets precisely and accurately.

With a maximum range of 40 km for Mark-I and 75 km for Mark-II variant, the system is capable of firing a salvo of 12 rockets in 44 seconds. The weapon system, mounted on a Tatra truck, achieved the desired accuracy by hitting the intended target with high precision, the DRDO sources said.
