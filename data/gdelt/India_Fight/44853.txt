Kolkata: Son brutally murders old parents using snib

A 36-year-old man, identified as Amit Saha, has allegedly killed his elderly parents on Tuesday night in Kolkata's Nataghar bye lane in North 24 Parganas district.

According to sources, around 2.00 am Amit Saha attacked his parents, 65-year-old Sunil Saha and 60-year-old Shefhali Saha, with a snib while they were sleeping. Amit allegedly launched a fatal attack on their head with the snib.

The police were informed about the incident by the neighbours, and immediately reached the spot and rushed the elderly couple to the hospital, however, they were declared dead on arrival there.

Police have arrested Amit Saha and also recovered the snib as proof.

According to preliminary investigation, locals have said that Amit was the only child in the family and had been suffering from neurological disorders.

Few also said that he has been mentally disturbed for the last few years after his divorce. Some also said that he did not share a good relationship with his parents.

However, the police is investigating the case and trying to ascertain the exact reason behind the murder.

Subal Saha, relative of the deceased said, "We never thought such a thing can happen. My sister-in-law told me to check on them after we heard a noise. When we went, we found them in a senseless state. They were killed with snib. Later the door was broken to enter the room. Amit was standing with the snib in his hand. I think Amit has some neurological problems and there was no effort to cure the disease."
