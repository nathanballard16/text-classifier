PM Modi meets mother, seeks blessings after spectacular poll win

Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to his mother in Gandhinagar on Sunday and sought her blessings after the BJP’s massive victory in the Lok Sabha elections 2019.

The celebrations in the prime minister’s home state, which has voted for the BJP in all 26 Lok Sabha seats, were muted due to the Surat fire tragedy in which 22 students were killed.
