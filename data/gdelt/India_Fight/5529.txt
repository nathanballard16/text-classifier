Ananya Panday and Sara Ali Khan competing to see who wins Kartik Aaryan’s heart?

Kartik Aaryan recently came on Karan Johar’s talk show Koffee with Karan as a guest and in a sweet gesture, also offered the filmmaker sweets sent by the actor’s mom. While talking about the actor’s love-life, it looked like Kartik isn’t a good liar. Every time when Sara Ali Khan’s name was taken on the show, he couldn’t stop blushing, though he tried his best to keep a straight face.

After being asked numerous times, the Pyaar KA Punchnama actor said, “I will ask Sara on a date when I have enough bank balance to take her out, as she is a princess.” Later, he was also paired with Ananya Panday who will be making her debut with the film Student of the Year 2 (SOTY2), directed by Punit Malhotra. Later, the star kid will also be seen starring with Kartik in the film Pati Patni aur Woh. There were rumours that Ananya and Kartik are dating which he declined and said that Ananya is just a good friend. Well, aren’t we all well-aware of this old-school way of celebrities calling their partners good friends? Interestingly, towards the end of the show, in a segment wherein Karan makes celebs call their industry friends, Kartik called Ananya, clearly indicating that the two might be more than just good friends.

Kartik called Ananya who immediately picked up the call which shows the bond between the two. Whereas, when he called Sara Ali Khan she didn’t pick up the first call and when Karan teased Kartik about it, he called Sara again after which she picked the call. At least it is proved that Sara and Kartik have exchanged numbers and are talking to each other. But it seems Ananya is giving attention to Kartik more than Sara, but let’s just put it the way Karan says, it’s a conjecture.
