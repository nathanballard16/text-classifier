Mumbai: 12 illegal slaughtering complaints filed, 4 genuine

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) received a total 12 complaints of violation of High Court order regarding slaughter of sheep and goat outside home or society campus during the Bakri-Eid festival on August 12. However, the civic body found that only three complaints were genuine.



Dr Sangeeta Hasnale, assistant municipal commissioner (Market) said that of the total 12 complaints they received, only three complaints were genuine. "In eight cases, the civic body had given permission and slaughtering was carried out at the authorised place," said Dr Hasnale. She added that in two cases, slaughtering was carried out inside society premises and on the terrace. "We seized mutton and also slapped fine to both of them," said Dr Hasnale.



In two places, goat skin was being cut in open which was opposed was locals. "All four cases were reported from Byculla area," she said.



The BMC had authorised around 825 places for legal slaughtering. "Official from the Market department visited each and every place before allowing slaughtering," said Dr Hasnale.



The Bombay High Court last week banned the slaughter of sheep and goats in flats and outside homes during the festival. A division bench of justices SC Dharmadhikari and GS Patel was hearing a petition by NGO Jiv Maitri Trust on a dispute over granting of temporary permission by the BMC for slaughtering sheep or goats for Eid festivals. The bench had also directed BMC to restrain from accepting or granting permission of slaughter slaughter inside any individual flat.



Advocate Ejaz Nakvi, representing the Muslim-e-Hind said that there is a need of guideline for carrying out slaughter during the festival. "We agree that there should be hygiene concerns. But, at present, there is no clarity and guideline for slaughter during Bakrid," said Nakvi.
