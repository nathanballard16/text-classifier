Three people were killed on Thursday in torrential rains in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain district, a day after two women died in a bridge collapse in Mandsaur.

The August 15 incident occurred in Mahidpur tehsil. Two school teachers, Shailaja Parkhi of Indore and Neeta Shelke, were crossing an inundated bridge on Somalia road, when their hired car was swept away by floodwaters into the nullah below. The two were returning from an Independence Day function at a school in Barkheda Bujurg village when the incident occurred.

On Wednesday, a woman and her daughter were killed in a bridge collapse in Mandsaur. That day (August 14), Madhya Pradesh received more than three times the normal rain, according to the IMD. The latest incident takes this year's overall monsoon death toll in Madhya Pradesh to 58, a TOI report says.

Western Madhya Pradesh (where Bhopal, Ujjain and Indore are located) got 142.2 mm rain, which is 94% more than the normal long-period average of 73.4 mm, in that period. Barwani and Alirajpur district got four times excess rainfall, while Ujjain, Khargone, Dhar and Burhanpur all got over 300% surplus rain that week.

Overall, Madhya Pradesh has received 18% above-normal rain this monsoon season.

The Weather Channel had earlier predicted torrential rain in Madhya Pradesh till Friday evening due to a west-bound low pressure system. The system is also likely to bring heavy rain in Rajasthan on Friday.
