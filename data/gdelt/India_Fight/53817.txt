MUMBAI: The city crime branch recently raided a flat at a prominent building, Jorawar Bhavan, in Marine Lines which was allegedly being used as a brothel.

The flat owner is in Malaysia, said sources, and Haneef Sharakali Uddin, a native from Assam, was the caretaker of the apartment, which was given out to a hospitality chain.

After the police got a tipoff, they sent a decoy who befriended Uddin and confirmed the functioning of the brothel. Police officials from the social security branch (SSB) raided the flat, arrested Uddin and rescued two girls who were forced into prostitution, said inspector Sandesh Ravale from SSB.

Constructed in 1938, Jorawar Bhavan was given on 999-year lease by the then governor general to Pratapsingh Raja of Sant state of Gujarat. In 1948, the Sant state was ceded to India and the properties were taken over by the government.
