Man found murdered on PAU campus

Ludhiana: A newlywed man was found murdered in the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) premises on Friday night.

The deceased was identified as Santosh Kumar, 26, a labourer who got married five months ago to Rachna.

Initially, it was believed that some miscreants had tried to rob him and killed him when he resisted their attempt. But, the police now are suspecting personal rivalry behind the crime.

Survived by his wife, mother and sister, Santosh was lone bread winner for the family and used to stay with his paternal uncle on the PAU campus.

Santosh’s wife Rachna said on Friday, uncle Achhe Ram asked him to get a ceiling fan for the house. Santosh left the house to get the fan from the market outside PAU campus at 10pm. Later, Achhe found the Santosh’s body in an isolated place on the campus and informed other family members.

They hired an auto-rickshaw and took Santosh to the civil hospital where he was declared brought dead.

The woman said as the mobile phone of Santosh was missing, they suspected that someone might have tried to rob him and killed him in the process.

Santosh was attacked on the head and even his ear was chopped, police said.

Assistant commissioner of police (West) Sameer Verma said the police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC against unidentified accused. So far, the police are probing the case from all angles. The possibility of murder due to personal rivalry cannot be ruled out.
