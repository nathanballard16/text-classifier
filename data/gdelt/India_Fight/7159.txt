A total of 44 security personnel from the Army and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have been martyred in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district since February 14.

Forty paramilitary personnel were killed on Thursday when a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist -- a suicide bomber -- rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF convoy headed for Srinagar.

India swiftly withdrew Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation status, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that the perpetrators of the attack would "pay a very heavy price".

Security forces have detained 23 men with links to the Jaish-e-Mohammed, Reuters reports.

On February 18, within four days of the first attack, four Army personnel were killed in an encounter with terrorists in Pulwama. One of them was a major.

A civilian has also reportedly been killed.

Terrorists believed to be from the Jaish-e-Mohammed, including a commander, are trapped in the ongoing encounter in Pulwama, sources said.

The sources said the trapped gunmen are believed to have links to the attack which killed 40 CRPF men.

India has warned Pakistan to stop supporting terror organisations such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed and other Islamist groups that operate from its soil.

However, Islamabad remains in denial and rejected suggestions claiming its involvement in the Pulwama terror attack on February 14.
