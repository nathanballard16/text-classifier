Earlier, members of farmers' body Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) also held protests demanding the channelising of water from Cauvery and Hemavati rivers to canals for saving standing crops.

Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, reacting to the KRRS protest, said that the Centre has to take the decision and give direction to water management authorities.

"The central government has already constituted the Cauvery Water Management Authority; the authority has now directed the Karnataka government to release 7 thousand million cubic (TMC) feet of water to Tamil Nadu; even Bangalore city is facing a drinking water shortage; in villages there is drinking water problem. The central government has to give directions, this is not in my hand."
