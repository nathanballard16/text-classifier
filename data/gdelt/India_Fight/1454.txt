Maharashtra has witness a spike in cases of man-animal conflict in recent times and leopards have killed or been killed at points of contact with human settlements. A major reason for this is the shrinking of the natural habitats for the big cats due to human encroachment. The ecosystems have been disrupted due to rapid afforestation and construction.

As a result such conflicts have become higher in their frequency. On Wednesday, a man was killed by a leopard in Chandrapur. The deceased was identified as 35-year-old Raju Nageshwar Gujlawar and he had gone in the woods to collect fodder. His body was found after an extensive search operation by the forest department officials and was handed over to his family after post-mortem.

Last year, 25 people lost lives to big cats as the man-animal conflict was escalated, according to a report given in the Lok Sabha.
