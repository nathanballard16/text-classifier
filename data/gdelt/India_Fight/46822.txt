Communal clashes broke out in Jehanabad some 50 Km from capital Patna following some arguments between two communities when according to some reports Durga procession was passing through a religious place.

About 14 people including 6 policemen were injured in the stampede and clashes. Two seriously injured and others have been admitted to Sadar Hospital.

People have blocked all the chowks in the city demanding action on the miscreants after the road rage.

Violence took place Wednesday night between two communities when some people allegedly pelted stones at a Durga idol immersion procession. Angry over it, hundreds of people gathered at different places after the news spread; they also pelted stones at people belonging to the other community. They also attacked a religious place, shops and reportedly set ablaze a few shops.
