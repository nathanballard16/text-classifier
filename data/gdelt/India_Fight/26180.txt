Watch: Tej Pratap Yadav defends his bodyguards after attack on cameraman, alleges conspiracy

A cameraman was thrashed while other journalists were manhandled by the bouncers of Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son and RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday.

The incident occurred when Yadav, accompanied by his private bodyguards, was returning after casting his vote. While he was exiting the polling booth, Yadav was intercepted by several cameramen who were seeking comment from him.

Soon after he sat in his SUV after speaking to the media, a leg of a cameraman got caught under the wheel of his vehicle. When other media persons present at the spot asked the driver to stop the vehicle, the car's looking glass was damaged.

In the heat of the moment, Yadav's bodyguards got angry and started thrashing the cameraman.

The incident has triggered anger among media persons present in the scene as Tej Pratap Yadav said that it was a "conspiracy to kill him".

"Today, I filed a complaint in the Airport Police Station on the attack on me and my driver and security personnel," he said in a tweet.

"My bouncers have not done anything. I was leaving after casting my vote when a photographer hit the windscreen of my car. I have filed an FIR in the incident. A conspiracy is being hatched to kill me," he added.
