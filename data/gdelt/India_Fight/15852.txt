Rumour: Tata considering entry-level hatchback below Tiago

According to a media report, Tata Motors is eyeing the entry-level hatchback segment and could develop a new model positioned below the Tiago. The carmaker aims to tap into this high volume segment to increase its overall market share.

Ever since the Nano and Indica were discontinued, Tata hasn't had a presence in the lower end of the hatchback market. But this could change in the future with the introduction of the modular ALFA platform, which can support cars between 3.6 to 4 meters in length. The first model based on this platform will be the Altroz. The H2X micro-SUV could be based on the same architecture, while the next generation Tiago and Tigor are also expected to switch to the new platform.

The ALFA-based cars are expected to be built at the Sanand factory. However, the Altroz is likely to be manufactured in Pune. According to Tata Motors, the demand for electric vehicles is also likely to shoot up.

The entry-level hatchback segment is currently dominated by Maruti Suzuki with the Alto. Hyundai has recently entered the fray with the new Santro, while Renault and Datsun have the Kwid and redi-GO respectively.
