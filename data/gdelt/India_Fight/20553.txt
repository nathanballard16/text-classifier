The One Super Uncomfortable Thing Arya Stark Had To Wear So That She Could Pretend To Be A Boy

'Game Of Thrones' has a cult following for a lot of reasons. One of which is the fact that the show has stellar costumes that look authentic to the timeline they shoot in. However, wearing such context-heavy costumes comes at a heavy price. Sometimes, the fabric or the design was so uncomfortable that the actors could do nothing but sit through long and tiresome shooting hours.

Maisie Williams, in a recent interview with a leading publication revealed that the prep for 'Game Of Thrones', aside from the strenuous shooting in extremely cold locations, also had to deal with uncomfortable straps and bellies.

For Maisie Williams, as Arya Stark in the initial few seasons, had to wear a strap across her chest to hide her breasts. At 15, while normal teenage girls had crushes and an awkward teenage life, Maisie Williams had to wear a strap and hide her breasts for long shoot hours as her character Arya, was pretending to be a boy in the series.

And after the strap stopped working, Maisie Williams had to wear a "chubby belly" to "even out the playing field" so no one( other characters) would suspect her a girl on the show.

It was only in the sixth season that the costume designers decided to let Arya grow on the show so they gave a bra to Maisie Williams as a part of the costume. This made the costume in general so much more comfortable for Maisie Williams.
