US, India agree to designate JeM chief as 'global terrorist'

United States National Security Advisor John Bolton called his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval to express condolences and outrage over the Pulwama terror attack orchestrated by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM).

The two NSAs agreed to hold Pakistan accountable for its obligations under the United Nations resolutions and to remove all obstacles to designating JeM chief Masood Azhar as a 'global terrorist' under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 Committee process.

"National Security Advisor Shri Ajit Doval had a telephone call with his U.S. counterpart Ambassador John Bolton on the evening of 15 February. The call was initiated by the U.S. side to express condolences and outrage over the Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM)," read an official statement.

Bolton also extended support to India's right to self-defense against cross-border terrorism. He further offered all assistance to India to bring the perpetrators and backers of the attack promptly to justice.

The two NSAs also vowed to work together to ensure that Pakistan ceases to be a safe haven for JeM and other terrorist groups that target India, the US and others in the region.
