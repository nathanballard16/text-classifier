India Capable of Tackling Terrorism on Its Own; Has Done in Past, Will Do Again - PM Modi

Modi said that in the past, India has shown its willingness to strike terror elements in their dens and would do it again. Addressing a public function in Mathura, 200 kilometres south of the national capital New Delhi, he urged the world community to take a pledge and stand up against those who give shelter and training to terrorists.

“Terrorism is a global threat, our neighbour is harbouring terrorists. The world should come together against the neighbour. We can tackle terror originating of our neighbour, we have done it in the past and we will do it again in future", Modi said.

The Indian Air Force bombed a training camp of UN-designated terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad in Balakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on 26 February. The bombing was in retaliation of a suicide attack on a convoy of Indian troops in Pulwama in the restive state of Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February, killing 40 troopers.
