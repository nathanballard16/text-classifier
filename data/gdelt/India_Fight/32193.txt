New Delhi, June 27

The Centre is drafting a detailed strategy to address the drug challenge in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday told Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

Capt Amarinder called on the home minister this evening to discuss state’s challenges, particularly in respect of the ongoing Kartarpur corridor project preparations.

The CM urged Shah to press on Pakistan to build an overbridge rather than a causeway over the Ravi as part of the Kartarpur project. He also demanded a National Drug Policy to tackle Punjab’s drug issue.

“Home Minister Amit Shah told Punjab Chief Minister that the Centre was drafting a detailed policy and strategy to address the drug menace in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Shah said this when Amarinder Singh reiterated his demand for a National Drugs Policy to combat the menace,” a CMO spokesman said.

Capt Amarinder thanked the Home Minister for Centre’s support to Punjab’s anti-drug campaign and sought attachment of additional Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officers with Punjab along with deputation of an IG-level officer permanently at Chandigarh along with DIG in Amritsar.

The CM also urged Shah to press upon Pakistan the need to construct an overbridge over the Ravi to facilitate devotees from travelling through the Kartarpur corridor in all seasons, without obstruction.
