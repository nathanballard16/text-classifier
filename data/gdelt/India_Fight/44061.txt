We had earlier reported that director Pa Ranjith ’s next project is a biopic in Hindi on freedom fighter Birsa Munda. While is was recently reported that Dinesh and Kalaiyarasan , who were part of Ranjith’s Attakathi and Madras respectively, will also be part of the yet-to-be-titled movie, the latest buzz about the film is that it has been titled ' Salpetta Parambarai '.The film marks the director’s first non-Tamil project, which will be shot in and around Chennai. Namah Pictures will be bankrolling the project in association with Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi. It is said that this script was the one Ranjith wanted to do immediately after 'Attakathi' but had to postpone it after bagging 'Madras' and then 'Kabali'.Meanwhile, Ranjith is producing to films as well – while Irandam Ulaga Porin Kadaisi Gundu has debutant Athiyan Athirai at the helm, the second project has his assistant Suresh Mari wielding the megaphone.
