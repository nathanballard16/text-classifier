More than 3.5 lakh lawyers go on strike in UP

Lucknow: Lawyers across Uttar Pradesh will remain on strike Monday. Over 3.5 lakh lawyers will not attend court but will hold meetings to press for their demands for better work condition and security.

They will highlight the killing of UP Bar Council president Darvesh Yadav in Agra last month.

According to the Uttar Pradesh Bar Council chief Hari Shankar Singh, lawyers from the tehsil level to the high court level will participate in the strike.

“We are demanding better working conditions and security for all lawyers. In cases where lawyers have been murdered, their families should be given adequate compensation by the government,” he said.
