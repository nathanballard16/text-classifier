Delhi Police on Thursday arrested one Jasmine Iscak for the murder of a Kenyan woman, Ann Sam.

Ann Sam was found murdered with a stab wound to her chest at her rented accommodation in South Delhi's Chhattarpur area on June 17.

Jasmine Iscak, 24, a resident of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania was unable to produce her passport or visa or any other identity documents. She was staying on the same floor as the deceased.

On June 17, the police control room received a call about the murder of a woman near Nanda Hospital in Chhattarpur. A police team reached the spot and found the woman's body lying on the floor of the drawing room.

During the investigation, apart from checking the call records of more than 25 mobile phones and CCTV footages, the police examined behavioural patterns of other residents of the building. Later, the needle of suspicion fell on Jasmine, who initially denied the charges.

Later on repeated questioning, Jasmine confessed that she had an argument with Ann Sam over a bottle of beer. Jasmine said Ann refused to give her a bottle of beer which led to an argument between the two and resulted in the murder.

Police have also recovered the murder weapon, a big kitchen knife, which Jasmine had hidden in her house.
