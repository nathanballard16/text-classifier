NSCN-U is a breakaway faction of NSCN (IM), headed by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, and is one of the seven insurgent outfits of Nagaland which are currently in peace talks with the Indian government.

Bohoto Kiba hit the headlines a few years back after he threatened to kill journalists for writing “self styled” while describing military designations of the insurgent outfits.

The pictures received mixed reactions on social media, some people called it as “heights of lawlessness” while some described it as “..matter of insanity”, others defended the couple saying it was their “personal choice”.
