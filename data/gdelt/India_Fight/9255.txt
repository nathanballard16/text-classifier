Helmed by Sharan Sharma, Kargil Girl is an upcoming biopic based on the life of India’s first woman combat pilot, Gunjan Saxena. The film which will feature Janhvi Kapoor in the lead role will now see Angad Bedi playing the role of Gunjan’s brother, Anshuman Saxena. Angad, who was last seen in film Soorma (2018), has reportedly joined the team of Kargil Girl.

A recent Ahmedabad Mirror report revealed that Angad and Janhvi were doing a late-night shoot. The publication quoted a source who said to have spotted Angad and Jahnvi shooting together over the weekend on the streets of Nirala Nagar. The duo also reportedly shook a leg to the song One Two Ka Four from the film Ram Lakhan during the shoot.

As quoted by the publication, the source also revealed, "They recreated Anil’s iconic steps during the late-night shoot. Angad plays an army officer, like Gunjan’s real-life brother Anshuman, while Pankaj Tripathi plays their father.”

According to the report, the ongoing schedule of the film will be wrapped up by March 2 after which the whole team will return to Mumbai. In April, the team will be back shooting the second schedule in Lucknow.

Being a grown up from the family of fighters, Gunjan joined the armed forces post her graduation. She then became one of the 25 women forming the women IAF trainee pilots’ first batch with Srividya Ranjan. Gunjan was also one of the first women helicopter pilots to be ever posted in the Kargil war. During the war, she evacuated injured soldiers and became the first woman to be awarded with Shaurya Chakra.
