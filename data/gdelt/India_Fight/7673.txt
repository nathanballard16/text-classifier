What proof do you want, Amarinder asks Imran

Says if Pakistan cannot get Masood Azhar, India will do it

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh reacted sharply on Tuesday to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remark that India had no evidence of his country’s involvement in the Pulwama terror attack, wondering “if the Pakistan Prime Minister wanted New Delhi to send the bodies of the soldiers.”

“What proof is he talking about? Should we take the bodies there? Masood Azhar is in Pakistan and doing things from there, and everyone knows it. Every day our soldiers are being killed at the Line of Control — so who’s killing them?” asked Capt. Amarinder.

In a tweet, Mr. Singh asked Mr. Khan about the action taken by Pakistan against the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack despite being presented with proof. “Dear @ImranKhanPTI you have Jaish chief Masood Azhar sitting in Bahawalpur & masterminding the attacks with ISI help. Go pick him up from there. If you can’t let us know, we’ll do it for you. BTW what has been done about the proofs of Mumbai’s 26/11 attack. Time to walk the talk,” he tweeted.

In an informal chat with presspersons in Patiala, he said the Pakistani Prime Minister, along with the Army Chief General Bajwa, was killing Indian soldiers and innocent people. “India cannot and should not tolerate this,” he said. “If they kill one of ours, we should kill two.”

Earlier, addressing the gathering, the Chief Minister underlined the importance of peace for development, but said India needed to avenge the killings of its soldiers. “Surgical strikes could be one way, but it was up to the Centre to decide what course of action it should take,” he said, while making it clear that he was not in favour of war.
