Fire at Aero India show destroys 300 cars

150 cars gutted in fire near venue of Aero India show.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A fire at an airshow in India destroyed three hundred cars on Saturday, a senior fire official said, the latest accident to mar the government-run event.

The most likely cause was a “dry grass fire aided by heavy winds”, said M.N. Reddi, a fire official in the southern city of Bengaluru where the show is taking place. There were no reports of casualties, he added in a tweet.

Footage from Reuters partner ANI showed rows of burnt-out cars and huge flames and plumes of black smoke.

The Aero India show, run by the country’s defence ministry, aims to become one of the world’s premier aerospace events, but has been troubled by accidents this year.

On Tuesday, two Indian Air Force planes collided in mid-air while rehearsing an aerobatic show, killing one pilot and injuring two others.
