PHUKET: Tourists fled in alarm as a taxi driver was shot dead by a colleague outside a hotel in Patong on Thursday morning.

The murder occurred in broad daylight in front of many witnesses at the taxi queue outside a hotel in Phra Metta Road in tambon Patong, Kathu district, about 10.20am.

Patong police said the victim, Songphong Suwansa-ard, 46, of Patong, was left lying full-length on the ground, on his back, with multiple gunshot wounds to his body. Six spent cartridges were found on the ground nearby.

The injured man was rushed to Patong Hospital but died on the way.

Police investigators learned that Somphong, a regular in the hotel taxi queue, had earlier been involved in a brawl with fellow cabbie Paradorn Phutchayant, 48, of Surat Thani province.

Paradorn lost. He then drove his taxi back home. Shortly later, he returned on a motorcycle, allegedly pulled a gun and fired several shots at Somphong's back before fleeing.

As the shots rang out,Thais and foreigners fled in panic. When they cautiously returned, Somphong was lying in a pool of blood.

Pol Col Anothai Jindamanee, chief of Patong police, said the investigation was continuing but it was likely a personal conflict or a dispute over the operation of the taxi queue.

Police were hunting down the suspect.
