KASUR: A man turned out to be the killer of his minor son at Tootal village in the Pattoki city police jurisdiction on Sunday.

Police said the suspect tried to give it a colour of abduction and later confessed to killing his son.

According to SP Investigation Quddus Baig, Ghulam Mohyuddin informed police that his five-year-old son Ahsan had gone missing on Saturday evening. Police registered a case against unidentified suspects and the DPO constituted a team headed by the SP to trace the missing boy.

They eventually arrested Mohyuddin on suspicion and he confessed to killing his minor son Ahsan. Later, police recovered the body of the minor from the ditches of Talab Sarai village near Manga Mandi.

Police were striving to ascertain the motive behind the extreme step.

According to a police official, the suspect had strangled to death his wife two years ago but the matter was resolved on the intervention of elders of the clan. He said the suspect seemed mentally upset.
