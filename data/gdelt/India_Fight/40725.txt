Rahul Gandhi Kashmir visit: J&K situation terrifying, says Ghulam Nabi Azad

Instead stopping Oppn leaders from visiting Srinagar, Centre should have sent them there: Gehlot

Criticising the Centre for stopping an opposition delegation led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from visiting Srinagar, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said the government instead itself should have sent an opposition leaders' team there to check the facts and win people's trust to its decision.

"The government itself should have sent a delegation of opposition leaders and let them check the things on ground themselves," Gehlot told reporters outside the Rajasthan assembly here.

"The opposition parties could have visited Srinagar and come back and told the truth to the whole country. It would have built confidence among people," he added.
