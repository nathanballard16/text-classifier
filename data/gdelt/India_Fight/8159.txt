A Deep tech startup Ariviya is disrupting dairy industry in Chennai Demo Day at IIT-Madras Research Park. Ariviya using Nanobiotechnology invented "MammaryO" to prevent "Mastitis" which is considered as the costliest disease in the dairy industry for a milking cow.



IIT Madras Incubation Cell and TiE-Chennai hosted the first 'Chennai Demo Day' at IIT-Madras Research Park with an objective to showcase India's leading deep-technology startups and help them to interact with investors, industry, government, and institutions across India. 200+ startups demonstrated their Deep Tech innovations including Ariviya.



"Our Vision is to help dairy farmers to Increase milk quality and milk production by preventing diseases that affect the quality and quantity of the milk. We use Deep Tech approach to achieve that vision. Typically in a Deep Tech industry, the technologists and scientists, work together to solve a problem in an unconventional way. In Ariviya that's what we do, we are a team of Nanotechnology scientist, Biotechnology scientist, Dairy Farm Veterinarian, Informational Technologist, Dairy Farmer and we are working together to protect dairy cow udder and hoof from bacterial infections." said, Swami Nathan, CEO, and Founder of Ariviya Inc.



"Bovine Mastitis is a bacterial infection that comes in a dairy cow in mammary gland udder area, mainly in the teat, usually caused by contact with milking equipment, bedding, and unhygienic farm environment," said Dr.Chinnadurai, a senior Veterinarian who has several years of experience in consulting Indian and International Dairy Farms.



Bovine mastitis is the costliest problem for dairy farmers all over the world. According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Report "Impact of Mastitis in Small Scale Dairy Production Systems," annual loss due to Mastitis is 2 Billion USD in the US, 1.5 billion USD in Europe and 2.2 billion USD in India. According to "University of Illinois Extension – Illini DairyNet" and "Foundation Agricounsel Research Study – U.S. Dairy Mastitis Market," Mastitis reduces milk production in the US by 11% and in India by 21%. Mastitis causes 70% of all avoidable losses during milk production. According to an article published in "A Summary of the Reasons Why Farmers Cull Cows" journalofdairyscience.org, Mastitis is ranked second after infertility as the main reason for culling (slaughtering) cows. 20-50% of dairy cows treated for Mastitis in Europe and the USA.



Dr. Siva, Chief Technology Officer of Ariviya, in Chennai Demo Day at IITM Research Park said: “Good udder hygiene practices should be an important part of the daily milking routine. “MammaryO” an udder care product, more specifically a post-dip solution, which would minimize the bacterial infection through our newly invented Nano-Bio polymer technology, it last long in the cow teat until next milking, easily washable, biodegradable and eco-friendly.”



"Preventing Mastitis means, doing big business for dairy farm owners because mastitis affected cow gives less milk, that means they are losing the quantity, and that milk is going to have less fat, that means they are losing the quality, no dairy farm owners want to lose quantity and quality at the same time," said Swami.



“We are actively working with dairy farm owners, Veterinarians, Partners, and Investors across India and United States. They see the value in what we are doing, the deep technology behind our product, the market size, and its demand and shows interest in joining us to scale our product to the next level," said Swami after visiting several dairy farms and its owners in Southern California, USA. According to the article "Top Milk Producing Countries In The World" by worldatlas.com, USA and India are the top 2 milk producing countries in the world respectively, Ariviya presence in these two countries gives an added advantage to meet their vision "Increase milk quality and quantity for Farmers."
