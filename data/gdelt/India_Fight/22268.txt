No Terrorist Ready To Take Over Jaish-e-Mohammed Leadership In Kashmir As Indian Armed Forces Continue Crackdown

The relentless crackdown of Indian Armed forces on the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror machinery has meant that no terrorist is willing to take over the leadership of the terror organisation in Kashmir, Indian Express has reported.

This was announced during a joint armed forces press conference chaired by Director General of Police in Jammu & Kashmir Dilbag Singh and General Officer Commanding (GOC) 15 Corps K J S Dhillon.

GOC Dhillon was quoted as saying that, “We have targeted Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) leadership, the situation now is that no one is coming forward to take over the leadership of JeM in the valley. Even after Pakistan’s best efforts, we will continue to suppress JeM, especially after Pulwama”.

He added that a total of 69 terrorists have been killed and 12 arrested this year. Out of these, 41 terrorists have been eliminated post the Pulwama terror attack. He also assured that the operations against terrorists would continue in full vigour.

Director General Dilbag Singh said that the local terror recruits continue to be low, which is a healthy sign.

It was earlier reported that the entire terror team of the Masood Azhar led Jaish-e-Mohammed involved in the Pulwama attack was neutralised by the India security forces withing 45 days.
