India elections: What you need to know ahead of results

Results will be out on Thursday (May 23) for the world's biggest election, spanning seven phases over six weeks. Thousands of candidates vied for 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament.

With around 900 million Indians eligible to vote, turnout was 67.34 per cent, compared with 66.13 per cent in the 2014 general election.
