Child’s murder: Accused still at large

Coimbatore: Almost a week after a 25-year-old woman and her lover murdered the former’s three-year-old daughter, the city police are yet to nab the man involved in the case. Two special police teams were formed to trace the whereabouts of the accused, but in vain. The case relates to the murder of Devasri, daughter of Paulraj-P Rubini couple of Velliankadu near Karamadai on May 26. According to police, Rubini had separated from Paulraj more than a year ago and she was living with her daughter. “She developed an affair with Tamil alias Sargunam, 28, of Kovilpalayam and they decided to murder the girl child as she became a disturbance for them.” The two subsequently fed the girl biscuits laced with poison on May 26 and dumped the body near a temple at Karattumedu near Saravanampatti. The next day, Rubini was arrested and she confessed to the crime.TNN
