Another 13 people were injured by lightning strikes. Officials say as many as 33 people died in a lightning storm Sunday in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.

Sandhya, a state disaster relief official who goes by only one name, said 13 other people were injured by lightning. He also said 20 houses collapsed in the storm.

The Mumbai Press, citing government statements, reported that seven people each were killed in Kanpur and Fatehpur, five in Jhansi, four in Jalaun, three in Hamirpur, two in Ghazipur and one each in Jaunpur, Pratapgarh, Kanpur Dehat and Chitrakoot.

India Meterological Department official J.P. Gupta told the Associated Press that a low pressure area developed forming a squall line. Heavy rains and lightning lashed the region when farmers were working in the field.

Seven people were killed in one village while working in a paddy field, police officer Pradyuman Singh said, including a woman and a child.

Uttar Pradesh's chief minister Yogi Adityanath says families of those killed would receive compensation of about $6,000.

Lightning strikes are common in India from June through September during heavy monsoon rains, the BBC reported. Government records show at least 2,000 people have died in lightning strikes in India every year since 2005.
