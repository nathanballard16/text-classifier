BJP leader Roy named in TMC MLA murder case

Kolkata, Feb 10 : Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mukul Roy was named in a police complaint here on Sunday in the Trinamool Congress legislator Satyajit Biswas murder case, police said.

Biswas, a popular Dalit leader, was shot dead by unidentified assailants while he was attending a Saraswati Puja programme in the Nadia district on Saturday.

Biswas represented Krishnaganj constituency in the West Bengal Assembly.

"Two accused, Kartick Mondol and Sujit Mondol, have been arrested," a senior police officer said.

According to locals, there was several "load shedding during the programme" and they smelt a conspiracy behind the outages.

The TMC and the BJP have been engaged in a bitter war of words since the killing.

While the TMC has alleged a BJP hand behind it, the latter has blamed the murder on the TMC's internal feud.
