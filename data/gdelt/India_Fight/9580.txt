India woke up to a piece of news that has left the entire nation feeling proud. The Indian Air Force (IAF) dropped 1,000 kg of bombs in the region of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) to eliminate terror camps in the area. This was a reaction to the deadly Pulwama attack, in which 40 CRPF jawaans lost their lives on February 14. According to reports, the strike took place at 3:30AM, using 12 mirage fighter jets that destroyed various terrorist regions including Balakot, Muzaffarabad, Chakothi. While several Bollywood celebrities took to their respective social media accounts to laud the officers of the India Air Force, south Indian superstars are nowhere left behind to appreciate the strike.

South Indian actress Samantha Akkineni, took to her Twitter account to praise the IAF and wrote, "No starting wars but ending it like. #IndianAirForce #JaiHind"
