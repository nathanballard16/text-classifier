The Maharashtra police on Saturday said they have identified the brain behind the IED blast at Gadchiroli which claimed the lives of 15 security personnel and one civilian driver on May 1.

According to the police, the attack was masterminded by one Girdhar, 44, who is allegedly the chief commander of the North Gadchiroli unit of the People’s Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). He already has a reward of Rs 16 lakh on his head and has been underground for the last 15 years.

Girdhar is known to use a number of aliases including Nagsu, Mansu and Tumreti.

Police said Girdhar is a native of Gadchiroli and hails from the Javeli village under the Kasansur police station area. Girdhar is known to have risen fast in the Maoist hierarchy is part of the State Military Commission of the Maoists. He is also part of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee Maoist which administers the “liberated zone” which falls across Maharashtra, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, according to police here.

Citing intelligence reports, police said Wednesday’s attack was carried out by one of the two companies under Girdhar. In all, some 60 men from six “dalams” may have participated in setting several vehicles belonging to a private road building company in order to lure the State Reserve Police personnel to the blasts site, officials said.

State government officials here admitted that the Maoists may have infiltrated the local units of the police in Gadchiroli and the attack may have been carried out using inside information.

“Girdhar and his close associates may have already moved out of Maharashtra and may be even holed deep in the jungles,” a state government official said.

Meanwhile, the police said they have named top naxal leaders in the FIR in connection with the Gadchiroli attack.
