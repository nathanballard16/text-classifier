Aamir Khan’s fans disrupt shoot

Laal Singh Chaddha’s shoot at a zilla in Rajasthan was temporarily delayed, as hordes of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the actor.

Aamir Khan is one of the most adored actors from Bollywood, and there is no doubt that he has a massive fan following. However, recently, this admiration proved to be a hassle at Bada Bagh in Jaisalmer where the actor was shooting for his film Laal Singh Chaddha.

Upon learning that Aamir was shooting in their small zilla, the news spread like a wildfire among the locals who assembled at the location to catch a glimpse of the actor. They further refused to move till they saw him, and the shoot was disrupted till then.

“Aamir personally came out, greeted his fans and even spoke to them in detail. He told them that he had to shoot and that they could also watch the shoot, but only if they dispersed and stood at a distance. The fans were elated when Aamir spoke to them and gleefully stepped aside to watch the perfectionist film for his movies,” says a source

After already completing the shoot in Chandigarh and Amritsar, Aamir will now continue to shoot in Jaisalmer before heading to three towns in Jodhpur — Rohitgarh, Bhadrachur, and Siwana to film his next few scenes for the remake of Forrest Gump that is being helmed by Advait Chandan.
