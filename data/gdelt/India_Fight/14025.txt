Modi could organise another 'Pulwama-like' attack to win polls: Raj Thackeray

MUMBAI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has claimed that another "Pulwama-like attack would come within a couple of months" at the height of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.



"Mark my words — another Pulwama-type strike will be organised in the next two months, during the Lok Sabha elections, to divert peoples' attention from all problems to patriotism," he said, addressing party workers.

Over 40 Indian soldiers were killed on February 14 in Pulwama, when a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into a bus in the paramilitary force's convoy.

Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah's statement on the number of casualties in the Balakot airstrike, Thackeray questioned whether Shah was one of the "co-pilots" who participated in it.

Dismissing the Indian government’s claim that a large camp of terrorists was destroyed in the air raids, Thackeray said had that been the case, Indian Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman would not have been allowed to return home from captivity by Pakistan.

"There is a limit to speaking lies. Lies are being spoken to win elections. In a bid to win upcoming elections, there will be another Pulwama like attack within the next one or two months," he said.

Moreover, Congress leader Vijayashanti Srinivas also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and likened him to a “terrorist” and alleged he was ruling like a dictator.

The veteran actress said the upcoming Lok Sabha elections was essentially a battle between Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi.

Gandhi was fighting for the survival of democracy, while Modi has “ruled like a dictator” during his tenure in a way that killed democracy and troubled the people, Srinivas said.

"Everybody is scared about the BJP today... they are scared as to what bomb Modiji will explode when....Appearing like a terrorist,” she said.
