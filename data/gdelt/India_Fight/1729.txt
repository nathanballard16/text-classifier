VADODARA: An unidentified man’s body was found from a farm on the outskirts of Chansad village in Padra taluka on Sunday morning.

An offence of murder was registered at Padra police station as the man was clobbered to death with an RCC pipe. Some labourers informed the police early on Sunday morning after seeing the body. Cops said that they did not find any identification card from the deceased. The murder weapon – RCC pipe – with blood stains was also recovered near the body.

The man was brutally smashed and his face bore severe injury marks. Cops suspect that the man was not from Padra but could be from Vadodara city or other place.

“No missing person’s complaint has been received from Padra region. We suspect that he could be from some other place. However, until the man’s family members come forward or register a missing person’s complaint, the identity cannot be ascertained,” said Ravindra Patel, assistant superintendent of police .

“The deceased had worn pink shirt and jacket and looks in his early thirties,” he said. Police sources said that the way the man has been murdered it seems that he was killed over a feud by a person familiar to him.
