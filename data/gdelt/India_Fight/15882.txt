Action star Jackie Chan is currently in Dubai shooting his new film Vanguard. During a break from filming, the 64-year-old talked about how he much he enjoyed coming back to the emirate to film another movie.

"I am happy to be back in Dubai three years after the shooting of Kung Fu Yoga. Dubai is a good place to film. This is why I have come back," he said. "I will come back again and again in the future."

The Rush Hour star also said he is impressed with the quality of the filming infrastructure and all the support he has received while shooting the new movie.

Directed by Hong Kong action-filmmaker Stanley Tong, the film's plot involves an international security company who are hired to protect a Chinese businessman and his daughter from a shadowy terrorist group. It also stars Chinese actors Yang Yang, Ai Lun, Zhu Zhengting, Jackson Lou and Mia.

The movie has been shot extensively in Dubai in various places including Dubai Studio City, Downtown Dubai, City Walk and its surroundings, apart from other prominent locations and residential areas, with the support of the Dubai Film and TV Commission (DFTC). The Dubai portion of the filming will be completed in a total of 30 days.

“Dubai continues to attract blockbuster movies from the major film production markets of the world and we are happy to embrace all of them," said Jamal Al Sharif, Chairman of Dubai Film and TV Commission. "The filming of Jackie Chan’s new movie in Dubai further reinforces the city’s growing profile as a hub for big global film productions."

Vanguard will wrap the Dubai section of its filming by March 22. According to IMDB, London, Taiwan and India are among the other filming locations for the film. The movie is expected to release globally next year.
