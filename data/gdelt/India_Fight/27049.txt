SRINAGAR: Zakir Musa, the chief of Ansar Gazwatul Hind (AGH), the al-Qaida cell in Kashmir, was killed in an encounter on Thursday evening at Dadsara in Tral in Pulwama district of south Kashmir, according to DG, Jammu and Kashmir police, Dilbagh Singh.A gunfight broke out between the holed-up terrorist and security forces at Dadsara village in Tral area of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Thursday evening after there was specific inputs about the presence of Zakir Musa."The inputs pointed to the presence of Zakir Musa at a particular house at Dadsara village of Tral. A joint team of Army’s 42 RR, SOG and CRPF cordoned off Dadsara village late last evening," DG Dilbagh Singh said."The security forces tried to convince Zakir Musa to surrender. But he fired some grenades using UBGL which triggered an encounter," he said, adding, "the killing of Zakir Rashid Bhat alias Zakir Musa is a major victory in the fight against terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir."According to police, the encounter lasted for around 11 hours and was officially called off during early hours on Friday.Zakir Musa, the chief commander and founder Ansar Gazwatul Hind, was the only surviving terrorist of the erstwhile Burhan group, which was active for the last six years and was involved in number of terrorist activities. Musa was carrying rocket, grenade launchers, projectiles, huge ammunition and war like stores, a police spokesman said.According to police spokesman, Zakir was involved in terror activities since 2013. He was initially associated with proscribed terror outfit Hijbul Mujahideen. He later floated new terror outfit Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH). Musa was wanted for his complicity in a series of terror crimes including attack on security establishments and civilian atrocities.As per police records, Zakir was involved in the planning and execution of a series of terror attacks. He was involved in grenade attack on CISF at Noorpora Check, abduction and killing of civilian Firdous Ahmad Hurrah of Dusoo Pulwama, inciting youth for terrorist activities, killing of civilian Hameed Bano of Noorpora, snatching of weapons from security forces, arson at govt higher secondary school in Dadsara.Zakir Musa was declared a proclaimed offender by NIA special court in Punjab's Mohali on May 2, 2019. The case pertains to his involvement in serial blasts at Jalandhar in Punjab on September 14, 2018. The investigation of the said case was later taken over by the NIA.Zakir Rashid Bhat alias Zakir Musa, a resident of Noorpora Tral was an engineering student in Chandigarh before he joined the terrorist ranks of the Hizbul Mujahideen in January 2013. He was a close associate of terrorist Burhan Wani, who was killed in July 2016.Ansar Ghazwatul Hind, the al-Qaida cell in Kashmir, announced on the website in 2017 that erstwhile Hizb commander Zakir Musa was nominated as its chief in the region. This was the beginning to over-shadow local as well as Pakistan sponsored Kashmiri separatist forces besides the Hurriyat leaders.Interestingly, Zakir Musa had threatened Hurriyat leaders and had even warned to hang them if they engaged in politics on Kashmir issue.Zakir Musa, son of an engineer with the jammu and kashmir government, was trying to promote the caliphate movement in jammu and kashmir and described kashmir problem as religious issue instead of political issue.Notably, IS flags used to appear at the funeral of every slain terrorist across kashmir valley besides dozens of youth would raise pro-Musa slogans.Surprisingly, the authorities as well as the police and intelligence agencies always rubbished the presence of IS cell in Jammu and Kashmir and trivialize the issue by dubbing it the mischievous acts of some rowdies.A top intelligence officer however, on anonymity said, there was presence of IS and al-Qaida cells in Jammu and Kashmir for last several years now but they are discouraged by the terrorist cadres, particularly the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit.Soon after the news about the killing of Zakir Musa spread, clashes erupted across Kashmir valley. The authorities, however declared closure of all educational institutions in Kashmir valley and snapped internet services in most parts of Kashmir.The authorities imposed strict restrictions on public movement across Kashmir valley on Friday. The security forces handed over the body of Zakir Musa to his parents at Noorpora in Tral for last rites.Hundreds of people from adjacent areas in Tral joined the funeral of Zakir despite heavy rain. The security forces had sealed the roads going to Noorpora to avoid any law and order problem in the area.To avoid any untoward situation in the valley, the authorities later imposed curfew in Srinagar and major towns of Kashmir on Friday.
