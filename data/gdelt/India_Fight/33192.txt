The 75th anniversary of a key Second World War campaign was commemorated in York with a royal visit and flypast over York Minster.

Seven veterans of the Battle of Kohima and the Burma Campaign laid wreaths at the service in Dean’s Park.

Organised by the Kohima Educational Trust, the service in honour of the veterans was attended Prince Andrew and special guests, family members and descendants of veterans of the battle.







The seven veterans represent a generation of courageous men who were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the face of terrible aggression.

After the service, conducted by the Dean of York Dr Jonathan Frost, three wartime planes flew over the Minster, including a Hawker Hurricane.

Posts on social media saying that the Red Arrows were due to be a part of the flypast were mistaken, an RAF spokesman told YorkMix.

The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, gave an address at the service next to the Kohima Memorial, saying:

We stand together today in gratitude and in remembrance of all who served His Majesty The King at the battles of Kohima and Imphal. Kohima’s War Cemetery has the renowned inscription ‘When You Go Home, Tell Them of Us and Say, For Your Tomorrow, We Gave our Today’. In memory of those who made the supreme sacrifice, Father God, make us better men and women, boys and girls, and give peace in our time.
