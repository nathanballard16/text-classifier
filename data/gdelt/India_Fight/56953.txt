PSUs in India had played a historical role in contributing to our economy. Even now it is playing its role well,” read the BMS resolution post the convention. “Unfortunately, the pro-privatisation lobby painted all the PSUs as inefficient. It is also making false propaganda that the entire PSU sector is in loss, which is utterly false.” The trade union also continued to attack Niti Aayog for working as an agent to facilitate strategic sale of PSUs.
