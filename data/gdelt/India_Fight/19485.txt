Kasautii Zindagii Kay: Hina Khan is in no mood to go to shoot today & her puppy face says it all; WATCH

Just like all of us, Kasautii Zindagii Kay’s Komolika aka Hina Khan is hit by the mid-week blues as she posted a video on social media wherein she is seen making a puppy face, while on her way to the shoot, and her caption reads, “M in no mood to shoot today…I need chutti..”. Soon after seeing the video, we wanted to shake hands with Hina because this is exactly what we were feeling today. In the video, Hina Khan is sitting in her car while going to her shoot location and her puppy face is what had all our attention.

Well, it was only a few days back that Hina Khan had returned from her fancy vacation to Maldives and from snorkeling to diving, Hina did it all with her family. And her puppy face is only reminding us the withdrawal symptoms that Hina is getting since she is sorely missing her holiday. After essaying the role of a bahu in Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai, Hina Khan is currently seen in a negative role in Kasautii Zindagii Kay as Komolika, but fans have been loving her negative shades so much so that Hina won the Best Negative Actress Award at the Indian Telly Awards

However, sadly, soon, Hina Khan will take a ‘chutti’ from the show as she will get busy shooting for her Bollywood projects and when Hina Khan was quizzed about leaving the show, she had said that after finishing her film projects, she will see if she is needed in Kasautii Zindagii Kay or how the show is faring and whether she has some other show in her kitty.
