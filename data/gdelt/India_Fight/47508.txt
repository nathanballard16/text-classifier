Four injured in the clash over fishing rights near the Paradise Beach.

The Thavalakuppam police on Tuesday registered cases against 1,100 people residing in the fishing hamlets of Nallavadu and Veerampattinam in connection with the group clash on Monday.

According to Superintendent of Police (South) Veera Balakrishnan, a case has been registered under section 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (punishment for rioting with deadly weapons), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons) and 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code in connection with the clash.

Four fishermen, two each from Nallavadu and Veerampattinam, were injured in the clash over fishing rights near the Paradise Beach.

Mr. Balakrishnan said two of the injured fishermen who were admitted at the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Post Graduate Institute left the hospital without informing the doctors.

Combing operations

They were actively involved in the clash and must have escaped to avoid getting arrested, he also added. After the clash, most of the men from the two hamlets moved to the nearby villages in Tamil Nadu fearing arrest, he said.

On Tuesday, the police conducted combing operations in certain places at Nallavadu to locate the troublemakers.

Around 120 policemen, including personnel from India Reserve Battalion, have been deployed in the two villages to ensure peace.

Kannan flays govt.

Leader of Makkal Munnetra Congress P. Kannan on Tuesday flayed the government for its alleged failure to solve disputes between fishermen of Veerampattinam and Nallavadu.

In a statement, he said the problems between the fishermen of the two villages were decades old. The peace talks held at the behest of the government had failed, he said.

The government should try to find a lasting solution to the problems raised by the fishermen, he added.
