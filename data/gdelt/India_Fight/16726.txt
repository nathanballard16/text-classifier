Fire Damages Property Worth Several Lakh at Honda Service Center

Patna: Once again, electrical short circuit was blamed for a massive fire that broke out in the Prema Honda Service Center located on Exhibition Road on Saturday evening destroying properties worth several lakh rupees.

As reported, the fire began around 5:00 pm and within minutes the entire place filled with smoke as people inside the building and around it hurried to stay out of the fume.

Though no one was said to be seriously hurt in the incident, two persons were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation.

About half-a-dozen fire trucks battled the blaze for over an hour before they were able to bring the situation under control.

Officials said the flame spread across the building within minutes because of large storage of plastic materials and canisters of engine oil.

Initial observations put the cause of fire to electrical short circuit but other causes have not been ruled out, a fire official said.
