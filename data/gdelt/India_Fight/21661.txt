Watch: Bomb defused behind WION correspondent in Colombo

A 'controlled explosion' took place in Colombo on Monday afternoon and WION correspondent Sidhant Sibal was reporting from near St Anthony’s Church in Colombo where the incident took place. It’s the second controlled explosion since morning.

There were no reports of injuries, WION correspondent reported. The blast occurred close to WION cameras. Security officials immediately cordoned off the area.

Police have confirmed a controlled explosion took place amid heavy security.

Reports had said earlier that eighty-seven detonators were found at Sri Lanka's Colombo bus station on Monday, a day after the series of blasts ripped through the island-nation killing at least 290 people.
