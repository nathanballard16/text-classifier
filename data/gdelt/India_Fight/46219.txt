Rajnath Singh approves 4-fold increase in aid for battle casualties’ kin to Rs 8 lakh

Monetary assistance for armed forces increased: Defence minister

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh has given his “in principle approval” to the proposal to enhance monetary assistance for the next of kin of all categories of battle casualties in the armed forces from the existing Rs 2 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.“The financial assistance will be granted under the Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund (ABCWF), which was set up under the department of ex-servicemen welfare in the defence ministry,” said an official on Saturday.Till now, there was a provision of providing financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to battle casualties in case of death, to those sustaining over 60% disability, and those boarded out of service due to the injuries sustained. This was, of course, in addition to the liberalised family pensions, financial assistance from the Army Group Insurance and ex-gratia payment.In addition to the various other existing schemes for the welfare of next of kin of battle casualties and their children, the Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund was established after a large number of people offered to provide monetary assistance on hearing reports about 10 soldiers being buried in an avalanche on the Siachen Glacier in February 2016.“When Rajnath Singh was the home minister, he had launched ‘Bharat Ke Veer Fund’ to assist families of paramilitary personnel killed or injured in action. The fund became hugely popular within a short span of time and received widespread support from all quarters,” said the official.
