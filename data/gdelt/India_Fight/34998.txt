On her birthday, she shared a picture of herself in a white bikini by the beach. The beautiful, sun-kissed photo had her friends going gaga over it, but the one person to pull her leg was actor Arjun Kapoor. He cheekily wrote “U’ve basically gone for a photoshoot” but later, in a more benevolent mood, said: “Ok on ur birthday I shall be nice Katrina. Have a super birthday ur a mad kind goofy soul and I love u because of ur nonsense not despite it.”
