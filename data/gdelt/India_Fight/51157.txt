Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) on Tuesday marked 100 days since the Modi government stripped the disputed valley of its autonomy and imposed a strict communications blackout, with local journalists protesting the internet blackout.Tensions have been high since August 5 when New Delhi moved to bring the region under direct rule, cut telecommunications and detained thousands of Kashmiris including political leaders.Pakistan has strongly condemned and ‘rejected’ the Indian government’s decision to revoke Article 370.On October 31, the Modi administration formally split up disputed Jammu and Kashmir state into two federal territories, aiming to tighten its grip on the Himalayan region that has been in the grip of a harsh security clampdown for over the last three months.Shops and businesses have remained shut to protest against the controversial decision, and children have not been going to school.Dozens of journalists held a silent demonstration against the internet ban, holding their laptops with open with blank screens or held placards with the words "100 days no internet" and "stop humiliating Kashmir journalists"."The authorities have treated journalists too as potential trouble-makers and choked journalism in the process," a freelance journalist said."Internet is so fundamental to journalism in this day and age. The authorities have choked our practices instead of enabling free press here," said another journalist, Naseer Ganai.They instead set up an office with 10 internet-enabled stations for around 200 working journalists, who queue up to use the computers for 15 minutes each.The protest came as reports said three militants died in two separate gunfights with government forces this week.
