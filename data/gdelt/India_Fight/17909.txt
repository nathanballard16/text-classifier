Jackie Shroff is one candid celebrity we have in the Hindi film industry. The veteran actor, who has been in the filmdom for nearly four decades, is known for his carefree attitude, something that got him famous as ‘Bindas Bhidu.’ The current generation of moviegoers might not be aware that he had extremely humble beginnings and spent considerable portion of his life in a Mumbai chawl. In a recent interview with Bombay Times, he unashamedly said that he was a ‘gareeb from Teen Batti.’

Talking about an incident from his years of struggle, Jackie revealed to the leading daily that he once wore a woman’s underwear for a magazine photo shoot. The actor said that he did not have swimming trunks required for the shoot, so he borrowed an underwear from his then-girlfriend, Ayesha.

He has been quoted as saying, “It [photo shoot] was for some magazine which ran it on the cover. Do you know that I borrowed that underwear from Ayesha? She was my girlfriend then. I was a gareeb from Teen Batti, I didn’t have the swimming trunks I was required to wear for the shoot. So, Ayesha gave me a part of her two-piece bikini, and it fit me well. I am not ashamed of it, I never was. People talk about feminism and choices, and the shift in the manwoman equation today. I wore a woman’s bikini for my shoot back in the 1980s. I am proud of it.”

On the film front, Jackie is gearing up for the release of Romeo Akbar Walter, set to release on April 5. He will be seen alongside John Abraham in the film. Next in line is Ali Abbas Zafar’s Bharat, due for release on June 5. This film sees him portraying Salman Khan’s father. He also has Prasthanam, the remake of the 2010 Telugu film of the same name, in his kitty.
