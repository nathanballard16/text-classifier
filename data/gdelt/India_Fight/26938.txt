Iran will not surrender to US even if bombed, Rouhani says

Iran President Hassan Rouhani says the Islamic republic will not surrender to US pressure or abandon its ideals, even if it is bombed.

“More than one year after the imposition of these severe sanctions, our people have not bowed to pressures despite facing difficulties in their lives,” Rouhani is quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency, according to Reuters.

“We need resistance, so our enemies know that if they bomb our land, and if our children are martyred, wounded or taken as prisoners, we will not give up on our goals for the independence of our country and our pride,” he says at a commemoration of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

Relations between Washington and Tehran plummeted a year ago when Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal.

Tensions have ratcheted up further in recent weeks, with Washington announcing additional economic measures against Tehran, before deploying an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran.
