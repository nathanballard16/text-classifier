Nonchalant Health Minister

We offer heartfelt condolence to the members of the family of Dr. Deben Dutta, including his wife at this hour of their bereavement. We could see, many lenders visiting the bereaved family to console the members. A delegation of the All Assam Tea Students' Union led by Rajen Gowala, while visiting the family, got emotional and touching the feet of the widow of the deceased doctor was seen weeping. Former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi also paid a visit to offer condolence to the bereaved family. But we are surprised to note that no minister, so far, paid any visit to the family. Normally, when a doctor on duty is murdered brutally by some tea labourers, we want at least the Chief Minister or the Health Minister should pay a visit. For our ministers, it seems, it is a non-issue. We could understand well that all the ministers are busy with the visit of the Union Home Minister. So, taking time out from their busy schedule is an impossible act for them. We are particularly disturbed about our Health Minister for his nonchalant attitude to the family of a doctor who has been dastardly killed by some senseless men. It is pertinent to note that many accumulated grievances brought about the downfall of the oldest political party (Congress) of India. The BJP should not be complacent and BJP ministers should be among the people in their hour of crisis to prove that they are actually for the people.
