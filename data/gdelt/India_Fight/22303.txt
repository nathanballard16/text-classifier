New Delhi, April 25

Months after Army Chief General Bipin Rawat promised to allow women to be recruited as ‘jawans’ — called other ranks in military parlance — in select non-combat streams, the process started off today.

The Navy is set to follow soon and have women in other ranks in the ‘Provost’ wing and Naval band. The ‘Provost’ is like Naval police. The Naval band, so far, comprises men musicians only.

In the Army, the online registration for recruitment in the Corps of Military Police has been opened from today and the last date for application is June 8. This Corps does not come in direct contact with the enemy.

So far, women have been inducted only as officers in the Army and this is the first time they will be taken in as jawans or in the other ranks.

The project to recruit women was approved by the Ministry of Defence in January after a study with an aim to enhance their representation in the three services.

Women, even officers, are not in direct combat with the enemy, though have been drafted into Corps of Signals and Corps of Engineers and get posted in forward locations. — TNS
