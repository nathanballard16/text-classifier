Nostalgia much, isn’t it?

Earlier, a source close to DNA revealed, “Shamshera will have the most breathtaking visual experience that cine-goers have seen on screen. Director Karan Malhotra wanted to shoot some of the most crucial portions in Ladakh because it would add to the visual appeal of the film. Ranbir Kapoor and Vaani Kapoor left Mumbai a couple of days ago and will start shooting for the film today. Since the movie is looking to transport viewers back to a period, huge sets have been built to recreate an era where Ranbir is pitted against Sanjay Dutt.”
