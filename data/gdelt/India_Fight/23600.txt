DG Vanzara, NK Amin discharged from Ishrat Jahan case

Nearly 15 years after Ishrat Jahan was killed in an alleged fake encounter, a special CBI court discharged retired police officers DG Vanzara and NK Amin on Thursday from the case. The court allowed discharge applications, which the duo filed after the state government refused to grant sanction to CBI to prosecute them.



"I have been saying since the beginning that the encounters were genuine, and carried out within the ambit of the law as part of official duty. This was the last case against me, and today, I have been freed of all charges," said Vanzara.



Special CBI court judge JK Pandya said that since the government did not sanction prosecution of the two ex-cops, their discharge applications were allowed, and proceedings against them would be dropped in the case.



Under Section 197 of CrPC, the government's sanction is necessary to prosecute a public servant for an act done as part of official duty. Ishrat, who lived in Mumbra near Mumbai, and three others were killed in an alleged encounter by the Gujarat Police on June 15, 2004.



Police claimed that they were terrorists, and were plotting to kill then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.



While CBI refused to take a stand on the government's decision, Ishrat's mother Shamima Kauser, who had opposed their applications, had said in an earlier submission that their pleas were "untenable in law and unsustainable on facts". She also contended that the state government was not the appropriate authority to refuse sanction to prosecute the two officers. Vanzara's lawyer VD Gajjar defended the pleas saying the court cannot determine the validity of the sanction order and any review was not possible.



He had said that judicial findings had established that the encounter was not faked and that the government had declined the sanction for prosecution after fully examining and facts and circumstances of the case.
