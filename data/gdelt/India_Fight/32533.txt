Talking about Kareena's balancing act between vacation and DID 7, a source said to DNA After Hrs, "Kareena has always balanced her professional and personal life well. She has a choc-a-block schedule ahead with four big movies coming up. She is likely to shoot for Angrezi Medium either in July-end or August, then there’s Takht and Laal Singh Chaddha with Aamir Khan. Her film, Good News, with Akshay Kumar, will release at the end of this year for which the promotions will begin a month before. She is flying down from London only for a day so that she can spend more time with Taimur. Besides, she endorses 17 brands, so there will be quite a few campaigns that she will be shooting for."
