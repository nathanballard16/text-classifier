ISLAMABAD: Indian hackers on Saturday were continuously attacking the website of Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office spokesman Dr Muhammad Faisal told Geo News.

“Half of our website was down in several countries following which we started to take action. We had anticipated this action, we know they [India] were panicking and would do something like this. The website has started being restored and would be completely restored soon,” he said, adding that India’s policy had no clarity.

Dr Faisal further said a hacking attempt was also made on his phone through his Twitter account two weeks back which was repelled.

The Foreign Office spokesman says the attacks by Indian hackers were an attempt to stop the right to information. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs website is a major source of official information including authentic news on Mohammad bin Salman’s visit and news on Kashmir. Journalists and analysts anywhere in the world can access this news from the MoFA website and the attempt is to stop this access.”
