Chennai: Police in Kancheepuram district of Tamil Nadu have launched a manhunt to nab a 30-year-old priest who has been missing after he murdered his wife on Wednesday at the couple's home. The accused has been identified as Maharajan, a resident of Soppanacheri near Padappai in Kancheepuram district. Reports suggest that the accused married his wife Karuthammal four years ago and the couple are survived by their three-year-old son.

A preliminary investigation by police revealed that the accused engaged in frequent arguments with his wife, suspecting her of infidelity. An officer with Manimangalam police told New Indian Express that the couple got into one such fight at around 9 pm on Wednesday following which the accused stabbed his wife to death with a kitchen knife and fled the scene of the crime, leaving her in a pool of blood.

The matter came to light after neighbours heard the couple's infant son crying and arrived at the scene of the crime only to see the victim lying in a pool of blood. She was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors declared her dead upon arrival. A case was subsequently registered in this regard against Maharajan at the Manimangalam police station. A manhunt has also been launched to nab the accused who has been missing since the day of the crime.

A similar case had come to light from Virudhnagar in Tamil Nadu in April of last year where a man later identified as Antony Raj of Salvarpatti village attempted to kill his wife and two children after allegedly suspecting her of infidelity. The accused later slashed himself with the same weapon he used to attack his family, an 'aruval'. While the woman survived despite suffering severe injuries, the man and his two children died on the spot.
