New Delhi, September 12

A day after a standoff between India and Chinese troops near Pangong Tso lake in eastern Ladakh, New Delhi is hopeful of early talks on boundary between the two countries.

A meeting between brigadier-level officials of India and China led to lowering of tempers after troops of either side were engaged in a face-off on Wednesday morning near Pangong Tso lake in eastern Ladakh. The Line of Actual Control (LAC), de facto boundary, is not demarcated on ground.

In New Delhi, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar said India was hopeful of boundary talks at the special representative-level before the informal Modi-Xi summit, dates and venue for which are yet to be finalised.

On the face-off in Ladakh, he said due attention must be given to the fact that it was quickly resolved.

The incident occurred when Chinese troops objected to patrol by Indian soldiers near Pangong Tso.

A brigadier-level meeting was immediately called at the border personnel meeting (BPM) point in Chusul, after which the issue was resolved. After New Delhi revoked special privileges to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 last month, Beijing had specifically objected to the conversion of Ladakh into a Union Territory. — TNS
