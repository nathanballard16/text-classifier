Architect to challenge incumbent for Hadley Planning Board seat

HADLEY — A write-in candidate will seek the five-year term on the Planning Board held by incumbent John Mieczkowski.

Mark Dunn, of Highland Circle, announced this week to the town clerk’s office that he will mount a so-called sticker campaign to unseat Mieczkowski in the April 9 town election.

Last week, Mieczkowski, a first-term board member, came under fire for what some town residents called racist remarks about an applicant with a project coming before the five-member board.

“I feel that as a licensed architect I can offer applicable knowledge and experience to the board for the betterment of the town,” Dunn said.

Dunn was among those critical of Mieczkowski’s behavior, saying he was “disgusted and appalled” by his remarks at the March 5 Planning Board meeting.

In 2006, Dunn was among those who served on the town’s Highway Garage Feasibility Study Committee.

Mieczkowski is the only candidate on the ballot for the position, which he won as a write-in candidate in 2014. As a retired business owner, Mieczkowski said he has the ability to study issues and make informed decisions on projects, including the fire substation planned for North Hadley.

Mieczkowski has defended his comments at the Planning Board meeting, in which he referenced the use of camels by a person from India, as a joke.
