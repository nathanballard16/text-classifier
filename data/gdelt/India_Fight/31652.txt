Follow us on Balakot airstrike: What transpired during 90 seconds of Operation Bandar

Balakot, India's thunderous response to Pakistan's terror-riddled acts. It was on February 26 when the Indian Air Force sent its package of 12 Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft. They then crossed over into the Pakistani air space and carried out missile attacks on Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot town of Khyer Pakhtunkhwa province.

India TV spoke to Mirage 2000 fighter pilots who were among those who struck the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp near Balakot in Pakistan in February.

India TV has been requested not to reveal the identities of the pilots.

On February 26, the Indian Air Force deployed 12 Mirage 2000 jets and they have been told to fire Spice 2000 on the given and loaded structure on Spice and it's a sure shot target.

When asked why Spice 2000 were used, one of the pilots said, "because of GPS locator and seeking device". The Indian Air Force, with inputs from security agencies, had all coordinates of Balakot's Jaish-e-Mohammed base. Starting off from Gwalior, Bareilley and then Himachal Pradesh, "Tigers" squadron entered Balakot from Uri. Within 90 seconds, Air warriors and brave fighter pilots dropped bombs on the terror camps with precision and safely returned in Indian airspace. But these 90 seconds were not easy, one of the pilots said.

There was radio silence...and then bang!

The two pilots shared that they had sleepless nights, no phone calls, no messages...but just one focus - BALAKOT. And we finally did it, one of them said.
