IAF personnel killing: Ex-JKLF commander Javed Ahmed Mir arrested

New Delhi/Srinagar, Oct 18 : The CBI had arrested former Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) commander Javed Ahmad Mir in the killing of four Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel in a militant attack in Srinagar in 1990, the probe agency said on Friday.

According to CBI sources, Mir was arrested on October 15 after a non-bailable warrant was issued against him earlier this year.

The source said that Mir was arrested from his residence by the Central Bureau of Investigation official and then released the next day.

In March this year, acting on a plea by the CBI, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court had allowed the transfer of proceedings and the writ petitions in a few cases to its Jammu wing.

These cases included the killing of the four IAF personnel in the Rawalpora area of Srinagar in 1990 and the December 8, 1989, kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of then Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

Mir, along with JKLF chief Yasin Malik, who is presently lodged in the Tihar jail in an alleged terror funding case, is one of the accused in both cases.

Earlier in 2009, the High Court had stayed the trial proceedings in both cases before a TADA court in Jammu while acting on a petition by JKLF Malik.
