2020 Toyota Raize sub-four-metre SUV leaked ahead of international debut

The upcoming Toyota Raize sub-four-metre SUV has been leaked ahead of its debut. The Raize is Toyota's version of the Daihatsu Rocky that debuted at the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show. The new small SUV is to make its Japan debut on November 5.

The Rocky and the Raize are based the Daihatsu New Global Architecture(DNGA), another off-shoot of the TNGA that underpins most new Toyota cars. Dimensionally the Rocky is 3,995mm long, 1,695 mm tall, 1,620 mm wide, and has a 2,525 mm wheelbase. The Raize is expected to have a similar footprint, which puts it in contention with cars like the Hyundai Venue and its rivals. The Raize gets a low-set, large hexagonal grille finished in black, flanked by sharp intakes housing the fog lamps and LED DRLs. The slim LED headlamps and the contrasting float-roof are other aggressive styling cues. As in on the Daihatsu Rocky, we think the Raize will get an angular B-pillar, a set of aprons around the upright rear-windscreen and wide two-part taillamps.

The new Toyota SUV s expected to debut with a three-cylinder 1.0-litre petrol motor with 98 PS at 6,000 rpm and 140 Nm of torque from 2,400 to 4,000 rpm. This will be paired with a CVT initially, a six-speed manual will be added later. An AWD ersion is also expected. The interiors should be derived from the Rocky as well, and come with a floating touchscreen infotainment system and an all-digital instrument cluster, alongside wide- rectangular elements for the AC controls and vents.

It isn't clear if or when the Toyota Raize will make it to India. However, as per the Toyota-Suzuki agreement Suzuki is set to develop small cars with Daihatsu. This could well mean that the Raize may form the basis of the combine's next challenge in India's sub-four-metre SUV space.
