Upcoming scooters in 2019, Part 1 - Hero Maestro Edge 125, Aprilia Storm 125..

The scooter segment accounts for around 40 percent of the total two-wheeler market in India, with annual sales up to 8 million units. With the growing trends for niche products in the Indian market, more two-wheeler manufacturers are coming up with premium offerings in the country. Here’s a list (Part 1) of scooters launching in India this year:

Hero Maestro Edge 125

Hero MotoCorp forayed into the 125cc scooter segment with the introduction of the Hero Destini 125. The company is now readying up the Hero Maestro Edge 125 expected to launch before March 2019. The Maestro Edge 125 is a sporty sibling of the Destini 125 and is targeted towards the millennials.

The Hero Maestro Edge 125 will benefit from Hero’s i3s (start/stop) technology that helps improve the fuel economy. The scooter pack features like boot light, USB charging, semi-digital instrument cluster, and side-stand indicator. Braking is aided by a front disc brake, while CBS (combined braking system) is standard. The 125cc motor generates 8.7 bhp and 10.2 Nm, mated to a CVT gearbox.

Okinawa i-Praise

Okinawa launched the Praise e-scooter in India in December 2017. The company is now set to launch an updated version of the Okinawa Praise, the Okinawa i-Praise. Okinawa had begun bookings for the i-Praise at an amount of INR 5,000 last month and received nearly 500 orders. The electric scooter will be launched in India this month.

The Okinawa i-Praise e-scooter will feature a detachable lithium-ion battery that can be charged at home within 2-3 hours. The i-Praise electric scooter is powered by a 1000 Watt, BLDC electric motor that allows it to sprint to a top speed of 75 km/h, while it has a riding range of 160-180 km on a full charge. It could be priced around INR 80,000 (ex-showroom).

Aprilia Storm 125

The Aprilia Storm 125 debuted at the Auto Expo 2018 in February. The scooter features bold paint schemes and new graphics to differentiate. Aprilia has confirmed to IAB that the Storm 125 will be launched in the country in Q1 2019. An earlier report suggested that the Aprilia Storm 125 will be introduced this month.

The Aprilia Storm 125 will come equipped with knobby tyres and 12-inch alloy wheels at both the ends. The scooter will be available in two colour choices - Matte Yellow and Matte Red - and will feature an optional tall windshield.

The Aprilia Storm 125 will source power from a 124.49 cc motor churns out 9.51 bhp and 9.9 Nm, mated to a CVT. The Storm 125 could be priced around INR 65,000 (ex-showroom) and will compete with the TVS Ntorq 125, Honda Grazia, and the Suzuki Burgman Street.

UM Motorcycles is readying an all-new retro scooter for the Indian market, the UM Chill 150 ABS. As the name suggests, it will feature a single-channel ABS unit as standard, while braking will be aided by disc brakes at both the ends.

The UM Chill 150 ABS will benefit from a modern-retro design that is on the lines of the Vespa 150 range. The Chill 150 ABS features a lot of chrome detailing to the mirrors, front apron, side panels, and the exhaust shield. The scooter is likely to be launched in August 2019 and could be priced circa INR 90,000 (ex-showroom).

Aprilia 'Comfort'

Aprilia is known for sporty scooters that offer tremendous performance for the buck. Being a niche performance two-wheeler manufacturer, it has limited its ability to provide a mass-market offering that will cater to the ‘family’ needs of the consumers. To address this, the company is gearing up for the launch of the Aprilia Comfort, a practical scooter.

As the name suggests, the Aprilia Comfort will feature a large floorboard, comfortable seat, relaxed ergonomics, compliant ride quality and ample storage space. It will use the 124.49cc single-cylinder motor from the Aprilia SR 125 that is paired to a CVT unit. The Aprilia Comfort is expected to be launched in August 2019.

TVS Jupiter 125

The TVS Jupiter is the second-best selling scooter in the country, with average sales of over 65,000 units per month (Jan-Nov 2018). The company has tasted immense success with the TVS NTorq 125, and introducing a 125cc variant of the Jupiter can bring more volumes for TVS. The TVS Jupiter 125 will rival the Honda Activa 125 and the Suzuki Access 125, targeting a higher age bracket.

TVS's 124.8cc, 3-valve engine produces 9.27 bhp of power and 10.5 Nm of peak torque on the TVS NTorq 125. It is mated to a CVT unit. The Jupiter 125 will most likely be launched by late 2019 with fuel-injection to comply with the upcoming BS-6 norms.

The TVS Jupiter 125 will benefit from CBS and could possibly feature an adjustable rear suspension. The scooter is likely to be priced aggressively around INR 55,000 (ex-showroom).
