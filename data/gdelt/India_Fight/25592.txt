Fire-cracker object stumps IAF Pune base

Indian Air Force officials on Tuesday (May 14) went into a tizzy after a suspicious looking objected was found within the Air Force School compound of the IAF base in Lohegaon, here.

A staff member found the unidentified object on the school ground, which is adjacent to a civil residential area and immediately alerted the officials at the base.

An IAF security team, along with the bomb disposal squad of Pune Police rushed to the school ground, cordoned it off and finally identified it as a pyrotechnic object, or a fire-cracker.

The pyrotechnic was safely disposed of by the teams without any damage to humans or property and the IAF has launched an investigation, said an IAF statement on Tuesday.
