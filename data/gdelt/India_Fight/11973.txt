Radar images confirm Jaish-e-Mohammed camps were hit

Images captured by radars fitted in some of the fighter jets that were part of the mission to carry out aerial strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot, Pakistan provide evidence of the hideout being hit and damaged, source said.

The Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) caught images of the target before and after it was struck. The images are grainy and not as clear as satellite images would have been. But satellite images could not be captured due to heavy clouds.

Officials, however, say there is no way to ascertain the number of casualties on the ground at this point of time.

The aperture radars that have caught the images are from Sukhoi 30 fighter jets that were remained behind the Mirages that actually struck at the terror camp.

India has maintained that Indian Air Force carried out a "preemptive strike" in the aftermath of Pulwama terror attack on February 14 where 40 CRPF troops were killed. The aerial strike was carried out on credible intelligence that more such fidayeen attacks were being planned from the JeM terror camp.

Within 24 hours of the airstrikes the Pakistan Air Force targeted military installations in India but no damage was caused.

"There is credible evidence to suggest that intended targets were hit and damaged but no way to make an assessment of the number of people killed," Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor, Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Space Operations) said during a press conference on Thursday. Airstrike near Balakot, a town 50 km from the frontier, was the deepest cross-border raid launched by India since the last of its three wars with Pakistan in 1971.
