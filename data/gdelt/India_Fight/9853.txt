Iran urges India, Pakistan to exercise restraint

Tehran urged Islamabad and New Delhi to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the dispute.

TEHRA (Web Desk) – Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi on Tuesday called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and make efforts to de-escalate tensions.

“Iran, as one of the victims of terrorism, believes that comprehensive and indiscriminate cooperation of all world countries is the only way to fight with terrorism and extremism,” Qasemi said.

He urged Islamabad and New Delhi to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the dispute.

Indian media quoted the country’s officials as saying that between 200 and 300 were killed in the Indian air strikes on an alleged camp of militias across the border between India and Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region early on Tuesday.

Senior Pakistani officials as well as a number of the country s party leaders condemned the attack and said the Pakistani armed forces are ready to deliver a response to any kind of aggression on the country.
