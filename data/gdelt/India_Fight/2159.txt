Spotify, the music streaming platform, could finally make its official entry into India this month itself, on 31 January.

The news comes right after the announcement that Spotify and T-Series, film and music company in India (which is battling with PewDiePie for the top channel spot on YouTube) had collaborated where-in Spotify customers will be able to access to T-Series’ entire catalogue of Indian music, including regional, Bollywood and songs.

The publication Variety first reported about Spotify's entry date in India.

The Indian music streaming industry has been dominated by the likes of Gaana, Apple Music, Saavn, Google Music and more. While there has been no presence of Spotify, in India, the collaboration with T-Series is a step towards its official entry into the country.

In March last year, co-founder and CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, had confirmed that Spotify will come to India. "We are working on launching in some of the biggest markets in the world, including India, Russia and Africa which has a very rich musical culture," he said.

Spotify had also leased land in Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai and hired 300 people to set up an office in India.
