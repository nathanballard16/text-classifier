A wanted criminal, accused in multiple cases including murder, was arrested in Delhi after an encounter with the police on Thursday.

The Delhi Police Crime Branch caught Raju Hakla, who also goes by the name Shyam Sunder, at Pushpanjali farmhouse in east Delhi, reports news agency ANI.

He has been named in more than 100 cases over charges of murder, extortion, theft and bank robbery. He was also accused under the Arms Act among other crimes.

Officials of several police stations were searching for him, a police officer said.

Acting on a tip off, a Crime Branch team laid a trap near the expected place of his arrival in the early hours on Wednesday. The accused's car was intercepted and he was instructed to surrender, police said.

Instead of doing so, he fired upon the police and tried to escape. He fired at a head constable, but missed. In retaliation, a policeman also fired a round in the air from his service pistol and the police team managed to overpower him.
