In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Palaniswami has stated: “Wing Commander Abhinandan displayed amazing poise and confidence in the face of adverse condition, which has won him many hearts across the country.

“It is appropriate that he be awarded India’s highest military honour Param Vir Chakra (PVC) for displaying most inimitable gallantry and valour,” Chief Minister Palaniswami further writes in the letter.
