‘India will never forgive murderer Congress’: Amit Shah slams Pitroda’s ‘hua to hua’ comment about 1984 anti-Sikh riots

Earlier in the day, Pitroda brushed off the anti-Sikh riots saying "happened in 1984, so what".

Hitting out at Sam Pitroda's remark on 1984 anti-Sikh riots, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday said that India will never forgive "murderer" Congress for its sins.

"Agony of the entire Sikh community. Suffering of all those Sikh families killed by Congress leaders in 1984. Attack on Delhi's secular ethos. All Summed up in these three words by Sam Pitroda - Hua To Hua. India will never forgive #MurdererCongress for its sins," Shah tweeted.

Earlier in the day, Pitroda brushed off the anti-Sikh riots saying "happened in 1984, so what".

On being asked to respond on the BJP's claim citing the Nanavati commission report that the instructions for the violence had come from late Rajiv Gandhi who had taken up the post of Prime Minister after his mother Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Pitroda furiously told ANI, "I don't think so, this is also another lie, and what about 1984? You speak about what you have done in five years. It happened in 1984, so what? (1984 hua toh hua). What have you done? (Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. '84 mein hua to hua. Aapne kya kiya?)"
