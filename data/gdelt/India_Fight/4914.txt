Kejriwal govt responsible for injustice to Soumya: Manoj Tiwari

Tiwari accuses govt of delaying case

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Thursday hit out at the Arvind Kejriwal government over the “delayed justice” in the Soumya Vishwanathan murder case, saying the Chief Minister had been quick to appoint high-profile lawyers in cases against himself or other Aam Aadmi Party leaders.

“The family members of the woman journalist are still waiting for justice even after 11 years and they are now fed up with the hollow assurances of the Delhi government...The Kejriwal government is responsible for the injustice to Soumya Vishwanathan,” Mr. Tiwari said.

High-profile lawyers

Referring to Vishwanathan’s parents raising the issue of the delay through a letter to Mr. Kejriwal recently, Mr. Tiwari accused the AAP government for “delaying the case and trying to get some political advantage”.

“When the Chief Minister himself or any leader is a party to a case, he appoints famous lawyers like Ram Jethmalani, P. Chidambaram, etc. But in cases of the woman journalist or the general public, it is left to the mercy of the government machinery,” Mr. Tiwari said.

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister told Chief Secretary Vijay Dev to appoint a special public prosecutor in the case.
