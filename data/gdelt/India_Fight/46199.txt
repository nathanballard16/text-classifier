Rana Daggubati returns to India. Plans to stay in Mumbai, not Hyderabad

Rana Daggubati was in the news recently after he lost a lot of weight due to unknown reasons. His latest photo went viral and concerned fans asked if he's sick, which resulted in drastic weight loss. Without responding to the questions regarding his weight loss, the Baahubali actor posted a series of stories on Instagram and wrote that he will be back in India in 72 hours.

This news has gotten the fans excited as they would finally get some news about the actor's absence in India for the past four months. However, the latest reports suggest that he will not be staying at his home in Hyderabad once he is back.

Rana Daggubati and his family have decided to look for a place in Mumbai where the actor and Naga Chaitanya's mother Lakshmi Daggubati could stay. Rumours suggest that his cousin has already gone to Mumbai to look for a house and make them settle there.

A source told Deccan Chronicle, "Suresh Babu's (Rana's father) sister Lakshmi (Naga Chaitanya's mother) is there with Rana and she may stay in Mumbai for some time to look after him."

The family remains tight-lipped about their four-month stay in the US. There are speculations doing the rounds that Rana Daggubati had to undergo a kidney transplant surgery.

At several instances, the Baahubali actor had dismissed it as rumours and called it boring. He also added that he went to the US to oversee the pre-production work of his upcoming historical film Hiranyakashyapa, which is heavy on VFX.

Rana Daggubati is also expected to shoot for Virata Parvam 1992, directed by Venu Udugula.
