Kartik Aaryan & Ananya Panday Go Through A Sleepless Schedule For Pati Patni Aur Woh

We know that Kartik Aaryan and Ananya Panday are in the ‘City Of Nawabs’ (Lucknow) shooting for the 1978 remake of ‘Pati Patni Aur Woh‘ with Bhumi Pednekar. It seems like Kartik and Ananya are burning the midnight oil by working late. They are compromising on their sleep, doing hard and work. Kartik and Ananya took to Instagram to share photos of BTS (Behind The Scenes) of Pati Patni Aur Woh, that also really late at night.

In one of the photos, Kartik captioned the image as “Night Shoot”. We could see two bottles, the script book, and a glimpse of a scene on screen. In the subsequent post-Kartik captioned the image as “sleepy”. He took a selfie in the car and was looking like a sleepyhead at 4 am. But the Luka Chuppi actor was looking super cute in the wee hours of the morning, posing with a thinking look.

On the other hand co-star, Ananya Panday also took to Instagram at 2.18 Am to share a photo of an isolated road with lush green trees. She captioned the image as, ‘Night Shoot’ with emoticons of a sleepy face and a cup of coffee. In the second photo, Ananya is looking elegant in traditional Pink attire with ethnic makeup and earrings. She captioned the photo as, ‘end coffee please’ and had a puppy face.

Meanwhile, Kartik will be seen in the shoes of late Sanjeev Kapoor essaying the role of Chintu Tyagi who is in love with a woman, in spite of having a marriage. Actor Aparshakti Khurana has also been roped in to play a pivotal part in the upcoming film “Pati Patni Aur Woh“.

The film is being directed by Mudassar Aziz and produced by Bhushan Kumar. “It’s amazing to join hands with Bhushanji one more time. After ‘Luka Chuppi‘, Kartik and I are quite compatible. So, you will see the chemistry going between us in this one too,” Aparshakti said.
