The city of Pune has seen good rainfall activities yesterday. These rains had been widespread in nature and moderate in intensity. Moreover, the maximum temperature also witnessed a drop of two degrees Celsius and settled at 37.7 degrees, which is still four degrees above the normal levels.

In the last 24 hours from 8:30 am on Sunday, Pune saw 31 mm of rain along with rainfall being observed in other parts of the state of Maharashtra as well. Mumbai also saw some rains last night.
