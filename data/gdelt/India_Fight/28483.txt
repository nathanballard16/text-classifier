Anubhav Sinha wanted only Ayushmann Khurrana for Article 15

Director Anubhav Sinha, who seems to have had a creative awakening, is busy shooting his second socio-politically relevant film after Mulk. Titled Article 15, the film was shot near Lucknow.

Shooting began in the outskirts of Lucknow from March 1, and was completed in entirety by the first week of April.

Talking about the film, Anubhav says, “Article 15 prohibits any kind of discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, or religion. My film is about the discrimination we practice on various levels.”

The director also discussed his newfound love for Lucknow. Has Lucknow become his favourite shooting spot? “It certainly seems like,” he says. “Or maybe I just use shooting as an excuse to dig into the exquisite cuisine that Lucknow has to offer. But seriously, it’s just that the city renders itself well to the theme and location of Mulk and now it’s Article 15.”

Anubhav is also enjoying the process of shooting with Ayushmann Khurrana. “I was very sure I wanted him for the character of the cop protagonist. Once Ayushmann said yes, everything fell into place,” says the director, who seems to have discovered his true bearings much later in his career.

“I didn’t plan to make Mulk or Article 15. Nor did I anticipate that Mulk would be seen as a new beginning in my career. It’s just that these were stories that had to be told,” he says. “The times are such when any Indian with a conscience would refuse to keep silent. Article 15 is an investigative drama where the audience too is an accused party. It is a very challenging film that needed an extraordinary actor like Ayushmann. Delighted to have him on board.”
