Indian Embassy has no grounds to support their army chief's false claims: FO

ISLAMABAD: The Indian Embassy has not responded to DG ISPR’s offer, indicating that they have no ground to support the false claims made by their army chief, tweeted Foreign Office Spokesperson Mohammad Faisal, on Monday.



Taking to Twitter, Dr Faisal urged the Indian Embassy to respond soon to the DG ISPR’s offer.

“Indian Embassy has yet not responded to offer made by DG ISPR. It indicates that they have no grounds to support false claim by their COAS. We expect them to respond soon,” he tweeted.

India’s Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat had claimed that the Indian Army had destroyed three alleged militant camps in Azad Kashmir, on Sunday.

However, the claims were made without evidence. DG ISPR Major General Asif Ghafoor said that the Indian Embassy in Pakistan was free to take any foreign diplomat or media person to ‘prove it on the ground’.

“Indian COAS’ statement claiming destruction of 3 alleged camps in AJK is disappointing as he holds a very responsible appointment. There are no camps let alone targeting those. Indian Embassy in Pakistan is welcome to take any foreign diplomat / media to ‘prove’ it on ground.1/2,” he had tweeted.

At least five civilians and a Pakistani soldier were martyred as Indian troops resorted to "indiscriminate and ruthless" shelling from across LoC in AJK on Sunday.

According to ISPR, one soldier had been martyred in the exchange of fire while two others were injured.

The military’s media wing added that in response to unprovoked ceasefire violations by India in Jura, Shahkot and Nauseri sectors, nine Indian soldiers were killed while several others were injured and two Indian bunkers were destroyed.
