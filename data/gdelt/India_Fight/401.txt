Soldier killed, another injured in avalanche near LoC

A rescue operation was immediately started and both were taken out of the debris. One, however, succumbed.

A soldier was killed and another injured on Thursday morning when an avalanche hit a forward Indian position along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district. SSP Poonch, Ramesh Kumar Angral, confirmed the incident.

Meanwhile, sources identified the deceased soldier as Launce Naik Sapan Mehra of Kangra in Himachal Pradesh, adding that a post hit by the avalanche was manned by 40 Rashtriya Rifles at K K Galki in Sawjian sector. Both the soldiers got buried under snow.

A search operation was immediately launched, sources said, adding that while Sepoy Harpreet Singh of Punjab was evacuated in an injured condition to a nearby health facility of the army for treatment, Launce Naik Mehra died on the spot.

In one of the worst tragedies in Siachen, a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) and nine other jawans of Madras Regiment were buried after their post was hit by an avalanche in February 2016 at an altitude of 19,600 feet close to the Line of Control (LoC).

Lance Naik Hanaman Thappa, who was buried under 25 feet of snow, was miraculously found alive in a critical condition after six days of rescue efforts.
