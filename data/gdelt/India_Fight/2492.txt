Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manoj Thackeray was found dead on Sunday, less than a week after Mandsaur Municipal Corporation president Prahlad Bandhwar was shot dead.

Barwani: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manoj Thackeray was found dead on Sunday, less than a week after Mandsaur Municipal Corporation president Prahlad Bandhwar was shot dead. Thackeray, an MLA from Balwadi, was found dead in a field in the Warla police station limits. He had gone for a morning walk.

Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan accused the newly-formed Congress government of failing to act on their promise of “change”. He said, “Congress used to talk of change but what change is this? Murders have started here, there was one in Indore, then in Mandsaur where a BJP leader was killed, now another BJP leader killed in Barwani. Criminals are fearless today. Law and order has completely collapsed”

He added, “Government is taking this lightly. There seems to be a larger conspiracy behind this (BJP leader killed in Mandsaur). I demand a CBI inquiry. A BJP leader was killed in Barwani, I warn the government that they stop such incidents otherwise BJP will come out on streets.”

In Mandsaur, Bandhwar was shot on Thursday in the Nai Abaadi area. He died on the spot. A day after the incident, Manish Bairagi, BJP worker, was arrested in Rajasthan's Pratapgarh in relation to the death of Bandhwar.
