Hina Khan bids adieu to a rainy Mumbai as she jets off to shoot her next project; slays her airport look: Pics

Hina Khan is a busy woman- from one shoot to another, from one city to another, she is always shutting between her busy schedules. Prior to walking the red carpet at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival, Hina Khan bid adieu to the cast of Kasautii Zindagii Kay as she exited the show as Komolika. Next, Hina unveiled the first look of her debut film Lines at the French Rivera and thereafter, she jetted off to Europe to shoot for her next film titled Wish List.



After coming back to the bay, Hina Khan has been chilling, working out in the gym and spending quality time with her family and of course, beau Rocky because today, Hina Khan is off to another city to kick-start the shoot of her next project. And before heading out, Hina was snapped at the Mumbai airport and as always, her airport fashion was on point- Hina was wearing blue joggers paired with a white crop top and blue jacket.

While the details of the project are not known yet but we are sure it is going to be exciting. Amidst all this, this talented actress does take out time to update her fans on social media and during a Q & A session on Twitter, when Hina was asked about which is her favouite actor from the cast of Kasautii, she said that everyone is her favorite and that she cannot pick up any one actor. A few days back, Hina Khan made a surprise visit on the sets of Ekta Kapoor’s Kasautii Zindagii Kay and videos from the meet went viral on social media as Hina, Erica and Parth poses for selfies together. As we speak, the cast of Kasautii Zindagii Kay is off to Switzerland to shoot some important episodes of the show.
