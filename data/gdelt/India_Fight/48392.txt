The two accused in the murder of Hindu Samaj Party leader Kamlesh Tiwari have been spotted in Shahjahanpur just hours after state DGP O P Singh announced a reward of Rs 2.50 lakh each for apprehending the duo.

According to sources, the two accused—Sheikh Ashfaq Husain and Moinuddin Ahmad— were spotted in the CCTV footage of a Shahjahanpur hotel near the railway station there.

Since then the Special Task Force (STF) has been conducting raids on the town’s hotels, rest houses and madarsas.

It has been claimed that the two accused had booked a SUV in Pallia in Lakhimpur Khiri and moved towards Shahjahanpur.

The STF has reportedly arrested the driver of the SUV car.



On Sunday, DGP Singh had claimed that a day before committing the murder, the two alleged assailants had checked into a hotel near the victim’s Khursheed Bagh residence.

They had checked out barely an hour after allegedly brutally murdering the former Hindu Mahasabha leader, leaving behind their blood-soaked saffron kurtas and a blood-stained knife and other personal belongings in the hotel room.

After sending the recovered items for forensic examination the police sealed the hotel room.

The CCTV footage in the hotel reception captured the two attackers moving out of the hotel carrying the box of sweets in which the murder weapon had been hidden.

Incidentally, the recovery of the same box of sweets from a Surat shop left at the crime scene led the police to Surat and the subsequent arrest of three persons - Maulana Mohsin Sheikh Saleem, Faizan and Rashid Ahmad Pathan alias Khursheed, described as the conspirators of the crime.

The UP police are bringing the three accused to Lucknow on a 72-hour transit remand. They are expected be presented before the court in Lucknow on Monday.
