Major fire at cycle paint factory in Focal Point

Ludhiana: A major fire broke out at a cycle paint factory in Focal Point, Phase VI, on Thursday night.

Firemen said they received a call at 8.15pm and rushed tenders to Roter International.

“As the two-storey unit is located outside the city, tenders took time to reach there. The ground and first floors were ablaze. The paint work was done at the ground floor. At the rear of the building, a shed housed a godown, where about 200 drums full of paint were kept. Therefore, our first focus was to stop the blaze from spreading to the godown, where highly inflammable material was kept,” said a fireman.

Even as they succeeded in halting the sprawling flames, stocks of cardboard delayed the operation.

“Due to rainfall, there was no electricity supply in the area. Consequently, tube-wells were not functional. As there was no water availability in the factory and adjoining units, fire tenders were refilled from a nearby hospital,” said another fireman.

Station fire officer SN Sharma said, “As many as 12 fire tenders were pressed into service and the situation was brought under control around 1am. The factory lacked fire-safety arrangements. Fortunately, there was nobody in the building at the time of the incident.”

Even as the cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, firemen said short circuit could have triggered it.
