Balakot airstrike: Statement given by foreign secretary is official statement of Indian govt, defence minister says

CHENNAI: Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale did not give any casualty figure after an Indian Air Force airstrike on a terrorist camp in Pakistan’s Balakot last week. Gokhale had given a statement on the airstrike- in which he said a large number of terrorists had been killed in the airstrike – which was the official statement of the Indian government, the minister said.The minister was replying to questions asked by reporters here on the conflicting numbers of casualties being given to media by different ministers and Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa’s statement that IAF did not have a number of the casualties.Asked if the satellite imagery of Balakot on the night of the airstrike would be released as proof, she said that no comment could be made. “It was not a military action,” she explained, adding that the strikes had been carried out after 40 CRPF personnel were killed in the Pulwama terror attack.“Based on evidence gathered by us about terrorist groups having infrastructure and training camps in Pakistan, the strikes were carried out aiming at the terrorist camp in Balakot, without bringing harm to civilians in the nearby villages,” she said. The Pakistan government had been given evidence terrorism breeding from camps in Pakistan, she said.“They refused to remove such infrastructure or to crack down on terrorists. Even after 26/11 Mumbai attacks, they were given evidence. The handlers were caught and tried in Indian courts, but still, there was no action from Pakistan's side. They were never arrested or tried in courts. Even if our actions were slow, we did punish such terrorists in India. But Pakistan did not take any action against then,” she said.
