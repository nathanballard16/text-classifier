Delhi cops to help probe ‘plot’ to kill Nagaland politician

GUWAHATI: Nagaland deputy chief minister Y Patton, who is also in charge of the state home department, has asked the state police to coordinate with its New Delhi counterparts to help investigate the plot to assassinate a Nagaland politician.The plot came to light after the crime branch of Delhi Police arrested a gangster, Vijay Farmana, wanted in 11 murder cases, from Lucknow on Friday. Farmana was reportedly in the city to meet his girlfriend. He had visited Nagaland with his associates Sharad Pandey and Kapil Chitania and obtained an Rs 80-lakh contract to kill a politician in the state.“The Government of Nagaland lauds the Delhi Police for apprehending... Vijay Farmana and his associates. Nabbing the notorious criminal was made right in time before an ugly turn of events happened as planned. The deputy CM Y Patton who is also the in-charge of home department (in Nagaland) appeals to the MHA for constituting a committee for carrying out an impartial inquiry,” a statement issued on Saturday said.Patton has asked the state police and other law-enforcing agencies to tighten security to pre-empt such plans. He said the Union home ministry should initiate a thorough probe.Positing that Nagas were never known as “blood money” killers and the concept of an “assassin” is alien to the state’s culture, Patton said if anyone planned a criminal act against the people of Nagaland, it will not go unpunished. “The Nagaland government will not take this incident lightly...,” the statement said.On Saturday, NPF leader TR Zeliang tweeted: “It is disturbing to learn about the contract to kill a Naga politician after the LS election. Investigating agencies should treat this as high profile case.... I would like to appeal to the GoN and the state home department... to coordinate with the @DelhiPolice in unearthing the truth behind the contract.”
