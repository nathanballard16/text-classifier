Lok Sabha elections 2019: Digvijaya vs Pragya battle sees 65 per cent polling in Bhopal- The New Indian Express

By Express News Service

BHOPAL: The high-profile poll battle for the Bhopal Lok Sabha seat between two-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh and BJP candidate Pragya Singh Thakur saw over 65 per cent voter turnout on Sunday — the highest over the last 10 parliamentary polls.

Interestingly, Digvijaya did not cast vote as he is registered as a voter in home town Raghogarh in adjoining Rajgarh constituency. But he remained busy zipping from one polling booth to another. Pragya voted at the Riviera Club polling booth close to her residence.

According to the Election Commission, 65.33 per cent polling was reported in Bhopal till 6 pm. The highest polling percentage in the constituency since 1984 was 61.87 per cent in 1999 when Uma Bharti defeated Congress candidate and former Union minister Suresh Pachouri by 1.69 lakh votes.

The rural Assembly segments of Sehore and Berasiya, which have traditionally been BJP strongholds, reported the highest turnouts, of 77 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively.
