According to the Bengaluru Mirror's post, Flight Lieutenant Hina Jaiswal hails from Chandigarh and holds a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the Punjab University. Elated with her achievement, Jaiswal calls it a dream come true for her.

Whether it be giving her best in the training to showing utmost commitment and not giving up, Jaiswal caught the attention of the authorities with her unmatched spirit and passion. Jaiwal's inclination towards the IAF was evident since a very young age as she took avid interest in wearing soldier's uniforms and flying aircrafts in the sky.

When Jaiswal was a flight engineer, she was posted to operational helicopter units of the IAF. As a part of her duties, she was constantly asked to operate in stressful conditions and in the process, she scaled from the Siachen Glacier to the seas of the Andamans. Jaiswal is eagerly looking forward to all the new challenges and difficulties that this new chapter of her life has in store for her.
