Villagers oppose blocking road to temple

TIRUPUR: Residents of five villages have opposed a move by the Hindu religious and charitable endowments department (HR& CE) department to block a road and erect fencing around a temple at Perumanallur in the district.The department has decided to block a part of the road which passes through Kondathu Kaliamman temple and erect fencing and a gate. Villagers of Karukkankattupudur, Appiyapalayam, Varanasipalayam, Kallumadaikuttai, Thailampalayam and Malayappampalayam opposed blocking of the road as it connects their villages.They passed a resolution against the move in a farmers and villagers welfare meeting held recently at Perumanallur. The resolution said, “The road is being utilized for many decades. Blocking the road and erecting gate facility are against the welfare of the villagers, even if the land belongs to HR&CE.”A HR&CE official said, “The land belonged to the temple. We would establish the gate facility for safety purpose of the temple. The gate would be opened at 5am and closed at night time.”
