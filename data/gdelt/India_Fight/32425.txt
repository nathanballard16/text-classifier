New Delhi: Two people have been arrested in the killing of Vikas Chaudhary, two days after the Haryana Congress leader was shot dead by two assailants outside a gym in Faridabad.

The Congress had condemned Chaudhary's killing, alleging the law and order situation in the state has been worsening under the Bharatiya Janata Party rule.

Two assailants had shot 42-year-old Chaudhary, believed to be close to state Congress chief Ashok Tanwar, dead outside a gym in Faridabad on Thursday. He was immediately taken to a hospital but the doctors declared him dead.

The incident was condemned by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi as "shameful and sad".

"The incident is a mirror to the deteriorating law and order situation in the state," he had tweeted.

The arrest comes a day after Congress workers protested outside Faridabad's BK Hospital, where the body of the Congress leader was kept.

Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar, who was also present at the spot, alleged: "Chaudhary was murdered as the government failed to maintain law and order in the state. Had been a proper security system in the state, Chaudhary wouldn't have been killed."
