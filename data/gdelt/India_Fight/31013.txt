Bengal post-election violence claims 2 more lives

BHATPARA: Two people, including a 17-year-old, were killed and six others injured, four of them critically, as the troubled Bhatpara area in Bengal's North 24 Parganas district witnessed clashes between Trinamool and BJP supporters on Thursday.This took the body count in Bhatpara to five since May 23, when Trinamool rebel Arjun Singh was declared the winner in a fiercely contested fight for the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat. The violence came on a day when the state director-general of police was supposed to inaugurate a new police station in Bhatpara.The violence started around 10.45am about 100 metres from the police station that the DGP was supposed to inaugurate.Two bombs fell near the gate of Reliance Jute Mill, sparking panic among workers who had queued up for their morning shift. In a few minutes, a crowd of several hundred gathered at Bhatpara crossing. They chased away the miscreants. But around 11.20am, a fresh round of violence started. There were contradictory accounts of what led to the two deaths. The victims' kin alleged the deaths were caused by police fire. Some locals claimed they saw armed miscreants roaming around with pistols.The Barrackpore MP squarely blamed the police. "Cops have given a free run to Trinamool workers. Seven people have been shot at," he said. Trinamool's Madan Mitra countered: "The BJP is seeped in the politics of violence."
