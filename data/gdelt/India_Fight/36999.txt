NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were killed and one injured Wednesday after a vehicle rammed into a roadside tree in India's southwestern state of Maharashtra, police said.

The accident took place at Kashil village near Satara district, about 279 km southeast of Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra.

"Early today in a tragic road accident here a vehicle carrying passengers crashed into a roadside tree on Mumbai-Bengaluru highway, killing seven people on spot and injuring one," a police official posted in Satara said. "The victims were hailing from Dharwad in Karnataka who were heading towards an airport in Pune."

According to officials, the driver of the car who was severely injured was being treated at hospital.

Police officials said the victims seemed to be from a single family.

Police have registered a case and ordered an investigation into the accident.

Preliminary investigations carried out by the police suggest the vehicle was being driven rashly and driver lost control over it.

Deadly road accidents are common in India often caused due to overloading, bad condition of roads and reckless driving.
