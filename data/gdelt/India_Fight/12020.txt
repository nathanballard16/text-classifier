India should release evidence of airstrike in Pakistan: Digvijaya Singh

Digvijaya Singh said that he is not raising questions on the operation, but "in the technical age, satellite pictures are possible".

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday (March 2) said that India should release the evidence of the Indian Air Force (IAF) airstrikes on terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan, like the United States did after killing Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.

Speaking to the reporters, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said, "I am not raising questions on the operation, but in the technical age, satellite pictures are possible. Like USA had given solid proof of the Osama operation to the world, we should also do it for our air strike."

The Indian Air Force (IAF) had carried out a pre-dawn airstrike on February 26. The airstrike came in response to a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed on February 14.

Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack.

After the airstrike across the Line of Control, Pakistan military spokesperson Asif Ghafoor had said that India should be ready for a "surprise". Next day, on February 27, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jets crossed the Line of Control, breaching the Indian airspace.

The PAF jets fled after India scrambled their fighter jets and chased them out of the Indian territory. Pakistan later claimed that they have one Indian Air Force pilot in their custody after his MiG 21 Bison crashed in their territory.

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured in Pakistan on Wednesday (February 27) after his MiG-21 Bison fighter jet was shot down by the Pakistan Army. IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman returned to India on Friday night.
