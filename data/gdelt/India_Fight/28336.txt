NEW DELHI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed and one was injured Sunday after a car carrying them collided with a truck in southwestern Indian state of Karnataka, police said.

The accident took place in Belgaum town, about 505 km northwest of Bengaluru, the capital city of Karnataka.

"An accident took place here today, in which a car collided with a goods truck coming from the opposite direction, resulting in killing of five people," a police official said. "One person critically injured in the accident was removed to hospital."

Officials said the impact of the accident was so severe that the car was completely mangled.

Meanwhile, in a separate accident a dancer, Queen Harish, and three other folk artists were killed and five others injured in Rajasthan's Jodhpur.

"Their vehicle rammed into a stationary truck which left Harish and three others dead on spot, besides injuring five others," a police official said.

Deadly road accidents are often caused due to overloading, bad condition of roads and reckless driving in India.
