Destruction of Vidyasagar statue insult to people of Bengal by BJP: Ahmed Patel

New Delhi [India], May 15 (ANI): Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel on Wednesday condemned the smashing of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's statue terming it an insult to the people of West Bengal.

Taking to micro-blogging website Twitter, Patel wrote, "We condemn the destruction of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's statue. This insult to the people of Bengal by BJP will never be forgiven. Greed for power will see the BJP dismantle every icon of Bengal, their legacy and the culture that they helped build."

Patel's statement comes a day after clashes broke out during BJP president Amit Shah's roadshow in Kolkata on Wednesday. Security forces later got down to control the situation but a statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was vandalised at Vidyasagar College during the clashes.

Shah too had condemned the violence at his roadshow and accused "TMC goons of resorting to violence due to frustration".

On Tuesday a BJP delegation also met the ECI in connection with the clashes and urged it to bar West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee from campaigning in the last phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha election. (ANI)
