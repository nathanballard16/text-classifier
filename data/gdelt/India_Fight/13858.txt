Balakot Ground Report: Situation after Indian Air Force’s air strike

Indian Air Force carried out strikes at terror camps at multiple places in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan in which the Indian government said that it destroyed control rooms of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and killed “very large” number of militants.

The air strikes by the IAF on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest terror camp in Pakistan was in retaliation to the February 14 attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, which had over 40 Indian CRPF troopers dead.

On the day of the Air Strike carried by India Air Force, India’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said that it had killed “a very large number of Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists, trainers, senior commanders, and groups of jihadi.”

However, the Satellite-data analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s Nathan Ruser concluded that there is “no apparent evidence of more extensive damage and on the face of it does not validate Indian claims regarding the effect of the strikes.

The Reuters also reported that the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camp in Balakot site which was claimed that it was hit by the Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter planes appears to be still standing with no visible damage.
