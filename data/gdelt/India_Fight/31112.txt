New Delhi: The Indian Air Force pre-dawn mission to blow up terror organisation’s Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot was code-named 'Operation Bandar'.

On February 26, a group of Mirage 2000 jets dropped bombs on a five-star resort-style camp on a hilltop forest, killing an unspecified number of terrorists.

India had dubbed the operation as "non-military" and "pre-emptive". It took place days after the JeM claimed responsibility for a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed.

In his first remarks after the strike, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in a public rally in Rajasthan’s Churu assured the people that the “country is in safe hands. There is nothing above the nation.”

While addressing the media on the day air strike took place, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had said that the "intelligence-led operation" had become "absolutely necessary" as it was conspiring more suicide attacks in India.

"Information regarding the location of training camps in Pakistan and PoJK has been provided to Pakistan from time to time. Pakistan, however, denies their existence. The existence of such massive training facilities capable of training hundreds of jihadis could not have functioned without the knowledge of Pakistan authorities," Gokhale had added.

Since the 1971 war, this was the first time that India had used air power against Pakistan.
