Amritsar, April 23

The family members of Radha, who committed suicide on Thursday, alleged police inaction in the case as the cops have failed to arrest the key accused till date. Rakesh Kumar, the main accused in the case, is still at large. The family members staged a protest outside the D Division police station last evening. The police have booked 45 demonstrators, including the mother and brother of the dead woman, for posing a hurdle in the movement of traffic.

Saroj Rani, Radha’s mother, said the police was deliberately not arresting Rakesh Kumar. ADCP City Jagjit Singh tried to pacify the demonstrators.

ASI Balwinder Singh, from the B Division police station, said around 45 persons of Gurbax Nagar had blocked the road without any reason. Following the harassment of the public, the police registered a case under section 188 and 283 of the IPC in this regard.

It may be mentioned that on the night of April 18, upset over allegations of extramarital affair by the family and neighbour, 35-year-old Radha had committed suicide in Gurbax Nagar. On the basis of a complaint by her brother Sahil Kumar, the police booked three persons. — TNS
