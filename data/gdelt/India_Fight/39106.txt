Inter-state illegal arms unit busted, two held with 12 pistols

ALLAHABAD: A joint team of crime branch and Shahganj police, on Tuesday, busted an interstate racket involved in smuggling illegal weapons from Bihar and arrested two of its members near Station Road after a brief encounter. The police have also seized 12 country-made pistols of 0.32 bore, four live cartridges and one SUV from their possession.

The arrested persons were identified as Naveel Ahmad and Bhaskar Tiwari, residents of Harwara and Saket Nagar respectively.

SP (crime) Ashutosh Mishra said more than five criminal cases were pending against Naveel and Bhaskar respectively.

He further added “The police received a specific tip off regarding illegal weapons and we intercepted their SUV near Station Chauraha road. The police cordoned off the area and managed to catch both of them.”

During interrogation, Naveel confessed that they used to smuggle the consignment of illegal weapons from Munger and adjoining areas in Bihar and later sell it in Prayagraj and adjoining divisions. Police, meanwhile, said that the duo had a tiff with a man and they tried to kill him in Dhoomanganj.

Last year, a video where Naveel was sitting on the bonnet of an SUV and waiving a pistol had gone viral on social media and he was sent to the jail for the same.”
