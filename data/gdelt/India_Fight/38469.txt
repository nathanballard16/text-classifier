If Kartik Aaryan has taken over Bollywood with his acting prowess, he is a star on social media, courtesy Instagram and Twitter. And now the 28-year-old actor is ready to expand his reach in virtual world by launching his YouTube channel.

Kartik, who boasts of 11 million followers on Instagram, will launch his YouTube channel on August 12. Confirming the news, the Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety actor told Mid-Day, "It will be a destination for my fans and well-wishers who can watch the real Kartik Aaryan, live in action."

The actor, who has been working quietly on the endeavour, said that his fans will get to see the unfiltered version of him through his channel.

"There will be original, behind-the-scenes and unfiltered content from my day-to-day life. It won't be limited to my professional life, but will also focus on fashion, fitness and my travels. YouTube has a wider audience; people love watching videos as it shows the real world around us. I've put a lot of thought to this page," added Kartik Aaryan.

The report suggests that Kartik is set to kick off the YouTube channel with a behind-the-scene vlog from Lucknow schedule of Pati Patni Aur Woh. The Gwalior boy is currently shooting for the film in nawabo ke shehar with Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar.

The Pyaar Ka Punchanama actor, who has become Bollywood's latest heartthrob, revealed that he has been planning to start his YouTube channel for a year now. And with everything in place, just like his social media accounts, he will manage his YouTube channel as well.

"I handle my social media accounts as I don't like anyone else managing them. The same will hold true for this channel. I have been planning to launch this since a year, and now thankfully, everything is in place," said Kartik Aaryan.

Kartik is not the only Bollywood star to start his YouTube channel. In June, Alia Bhatt launched her YouTube channel. Talking about her YouTube channel, Alia said, "I have done the Insta world and Twitter world, and now I am trying to get into the YouTube world. What you will get to see on my YouTube is a lot me, totally unadulterated. What goes on behind the scenes, good days, bad days, funny days, hectic days, simple days, sweet days."
