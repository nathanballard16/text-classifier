New Delhi:

Six people, including four Indian Army soldiers and two porters, succumbed to their injuries after they were struck by an avalanche in northern Siachen Glacier on Monday, the Army said. The team was on a patrol when the avalanche hit them around 3 pm.

The Army said: "Eight personnel operating in Northern Sector of Siachen Glacier at an altitude of 19,000 feet were hit by an avalanche. Avalanche Rescue Teams from nearby posts rushed to the location."

"All eight personnel were pulled out of avalanche debris. Seven individuals who were critically injured, accompanied by medical teams were evacuated by helicopters to nearest Military Hospital. Six casualties, four soldiers and two civilian porters, succumbed to extreme hypothermia," the India Army said in a statement.

The Siachen Glacier at the height of around 20,000 ft in the Karakoram range is known as the highest militarised zone in the world where the soldiers have to battle frostbite and high winds.

Avalanches and landslides are common at the glacier during the winters and temperatures can drop to as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius.

The incident comes day after two porters were reported missing after a snow avalanche hit the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district on November 11. The incident took place in Gulmarg sector in north Kashmir, a police official said.
