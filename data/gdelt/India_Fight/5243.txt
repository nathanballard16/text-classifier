Kolkata: Hours after the murder of Trinamool Congress MLA Satyajit Biswas in Nadia yesterday, West Bengal police named BJP leader Mukul Roy in the FIR and arrested two accused today. Apart from this, the Officer-In-Charge (OC) of Hanskhali Police Station has been suspended. Mukul Roy left TMC in 2017 and joined the BJP.

Biswas, who was Trinamool legislator from Krishnagunj in Nadia district, was shot dead at Phulbari in Jalpaiguri. The incident happened when he was attending Saraswati Puja celebrations at Phulbari. According to reports, the lawmaker was shot multiple times from a close range when he was coming down the stage after attending the event, reported ANI.

The TMC has been blaming BJP for the murder of its MLA and district president Gauri Shankar Dutta alleged that Biswas had defeated the BJP candidate twice by a huge margin and that’s why he was targeted.

“Satyajit Biswas was BJP's target for a very long time. He had been a preventive wall of the attempts of Mukul Roy and Soumitra Thakur for movement of 'Matua' votes to BJP. The murder of Biswas is the handiwork of Mukul Roy. He is touring these days across the area to strengthen the BJP. He is the conspirator. Roy had earlier lashed out at Satyajit. We will fight it (the murder case) and ensure that justice is served,” ANI quoted Dutta as saying.

Denying the allegations BJP state president Dilip Ghosh pinned the murder on factional feud within the TMC. Slamming Mamata Banerjee for total lawlessness in the state Ghosh further said that BJP is blamed every time if a TMC supporter or worker is killed but how can the BJP kill a TMC MLA if our own security is in question.
