Balakot terror camps in Pakistan being reactivated, govt tells Parliament

Terror camps in Pakistan's Balakot are being reactivated, the Centre said on Wednesday, months after the Indian Air Force (IAF) bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad facility in retaliation to Pulwama terror attack.

In reply to a query by Congress's Ahmed Patel, the Ministry of Home Affairs has said it has received inputs that indicate attempts being made by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed to reactivate its camp at Balakot.

The government added terror groups were also trying to "restart their religious and Jihadi indoctrination courses" against India.

The government said, "India is committed to take all necessary measures to protect borders of the country and maintain its integrity and sovereignty."

In September, Army chief General Bipin Rawat had said the Jaish-e-Mohammed's terror facility in Pakistan's Balakot had been reactivated.

"Balakot has been reactivated by Pakistan very recently. It had been damaged and destroyed. And that is why people have got away from there and now it has been reactivated. It shows some action had been taken by Indian Air Force and now they have got the people back there," Bipin Rawat had said in Chennai.

General Rawat had said around 500 infiltrators were waiting to enter India.

IAF jets had destroyed terror launch pads in Balakot in an aerial attack carried out on February 27.

During the airstrike, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman brought down a Pakistani F-16 but was taken prisoner near the Line of Control (LoC). He was later released.
