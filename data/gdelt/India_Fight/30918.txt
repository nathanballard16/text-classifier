No exemption for Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from weekly hearing, rules NIA court

A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Thursday rejected an application filed by Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur demanding permanent exemption from weekly hearings in Malegaon blast case. Newly-elected Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP had sought exemption from the hearings on the basis of her health.

Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur had also cited her MP status mentioning she has to attend the Parliament on a day-to-day basis. Sadhvi Pragya took oath in Lok Sabha on Monday. She won the recently concluded Lok Sabha election from Bhopal parliamentary constituency defeating Congress veteran and two-time Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh.

She is an accused in Malegaon blast case of Maharashtra in which six people were killed more than 10 years ago.

Meanwhile, her oath-taking had also created ruckus in Lok Sabha as she took the name of her guru while taking oath of duty in Sanskrit.

The NIA court on Thursday had however exempted her from attending the hearing. Earlier, Pragya SIngh Thakur had told the NIA court that she was not aware of the 2008 Malegaon blast. After the court hearing, BJP leader Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur had also shouted at the investigating officer of case for not providing her with an appropriate chair during the hearing of the case.

Six people were killed and over 100 injured on September 29, 2008 when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon.

Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur is among eight prime accused in the case.
