Eight open fire at woman’s house

Rajkot: Eight persons fired three rounds in the air and vandalized a woman’s house in Matava Vad locality of Junagadh on Saturday. The accused arrived at Farzana Baloch’s house (43) at 3am on Saturday and created a ruckus.“They wanted to teach her a lesson over old enmity. We are yet to confirm whether the firearm used in the crime was a revolver, a country-made pistol or a rifle,” said police, adding that a manhunt to nab the accused has been launched.
