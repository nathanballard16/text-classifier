The Supreme Court today transferred from Shimla to Chandigarh a case relating to the alleged custodial death of a man accused of gangrape and murder of a minor schoolgirl in Kotkhai, Himachal Pradesh, in 2017.

A 16-year-old girl went missing in Kotkhai on July 4, 2017, and her body was found from Halaila forests on July 6. The post-mortem confirmed rape and murder.

Amid public outcry, an SIT, headed by Inspector General of Police Zahur Haidar Zaidi, was constituted that arrested six persons. After the custodial death of accused Suraj, the High Court handed over the probe to the CBI. Zaidi and seven others were arrested in connection with the custodial death of Suraj.

On Tuesday, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi transferred the case to Chandigarh after the CBI and the accused said they had no objection to the case being shifted out of Himachal.

The CBI counsel said a chargesheet had been filed against several police officials. While granting bail to Zaidi on April 5, the SC had said it would deal with the issue of transferring the trial at a later stage.
