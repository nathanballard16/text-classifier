Shimla, Mar 06: A government school in the native village of CRPF jawan Tilak Raj, killed in the Pulwama attack, will be named after him, an official said on Wednesday. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel hailed from Dhewa village in Himachal Pradesh's Kangra district.

In a meeting of the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, it was decided to upgrade the Government Middle School, Dhewa to Government High School, the official said.

The cabinet also gave its consent to rename it as Shahid Tilak Raj Government High School, Dhewa as a mark of respect to the martyr, the official added. Thirty-year-old Tilak Raj was injured in the February 14 attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir and succumbed to his injuries in the army hospital.
