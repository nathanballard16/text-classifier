Lok Sabha elections 2019: Arvind Kejriwal campaigns with enhanced security

A day after he was attacked by a man during a road show, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal campaigned on Sunday under a heavy security cover in the Kakrola village near Dwarka. At least 50 security personnel, including police officers, commandos, CRPF personnel, party workers and civil defence personnel guarded Kejriwal at the campaign on Sunday.

At Kakrola, the AAP chief sought votes for party’s West Delhi candidate, Balbir Singh Jakhar.

Police officers used a green rope to maintain a security cordon around Kejriwal’s open jeep in which he was standing on a makeshift podium and waving to the crowd. Next to the rope were AAP volunteers who called themselves the “first line of defence”.

A volunteer, who was part of a group protecting the CM’s vehicle, said, “Though the security has been increased by the police after yesterday’s (Saturday) incident but we cannot rely on them only. We are also monitoring the situation.”

Addressing the crowd before starting the road show at Pipal Chowk in Kakrola near Dwarka, Kejriwal appealed the public to vote for the AAP. Kejriwal was accompanied by Jakhar, Najafgarh MLA Kailash Gahlot and Matiala legislator Gulab Singh.

The CM’s motorcade traversed through lanes of Kakrola, Dwarka Sector-3 slum cluster, Matiala village, Navada Metro, Uttam Nagar, Hastasal, Vikas Puri, Ring Road, Tilak Nagar before culminating at Tilak Nagar main market.

At a slum cluster in Dwarka sector-3, some residents tried to garland Kejriwal and also tried to give him flowers but the security persons did not allow to go near him.

They had to hand over the garlands to the police personnel.
