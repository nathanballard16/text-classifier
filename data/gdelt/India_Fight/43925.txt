Man Attempts Suicide Near Christopher Nolan’s Tenet Sets In Mumbai, Set Design Saves Him!

According to recent reports, a man was rescued after he attempted suicide near the sets of the Christopher Nolan movie Tenet. The crew of the film including Nolan is currently in Mumbai for the shoot of the film.

Talking to media, an eye-witness claimed that thanks to the design of the sets, that became an integral part of the rescue. A Pinkvilla report has quoted a source as saying,

“The lifeguards were unable to get a hold of the man but thanks to the set design of the movie, they were able to use the ropes to tie the man and rescue him. The police immediately picked him up and took him in their truck. A sympathetic crew member checked with his team to ensure that the man was alright.”

The crew started filming in Mumbai on Monday. Reports also claim that actors Robert Pattinson and John David Washington shot for the sequence in Colaba Causeway in the early hours of September 16 and later shot at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club.

The report adds that the man jumped into the water just opposite the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel right after they wrapped up the shoot for that day.
