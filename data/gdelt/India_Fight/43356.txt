Army officer who went missing in Congo found dead in lake

An Army officer, who had gone missing five days ago in Democratic Republic of Congo, was found dead in Lake Kivu on Thursday. The officer, Lt Col Gaurav Solanki, had disappeared after he went on a kayaking trip to the water body bordering Rwanda.

Lt Col Solanki, a part of the Indian contingent in the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Central African nation, was deputed as a military observer.

"Everyone had returned except Solanki following the kayaking trip. A massive search and rescue operation was launched with speed boats and helicopters. His body was retrieved around 11 am on Thursday," said an officer. The cause of his death is yet to be ascertained.

Sources said Solanki had completed his assignment in Congo and was due to return to his regiment in India within the next few days.

Indian Army's participation in the UN peacekeeping operations spans 57 years covering 43 Missions, in which over ninety-thousand Indian soldiers have served in various parts of the world.

Presently, India is ranked, as the third-largest troop contributor to the UN. India has sent battalion groups, engineers, medical teams, military observers and staff personnel to Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Lebanon, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Congo, Sudan, and Golan Heights.
