Mental Hai Kya promotion begins with new title

While it was also being speculated that the film will have a reshoot, nothing of that sort has happened.

The actors from the upcoming film Mental Hai Kya, which now has a new title, were shooting promotional videos for the film at a suburban hotel in Mumbai on Monday.

The actors — Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao — quietly shot for the video amidst high security. “It was a promotional video alright. But they also shot with the new title that they have planned for the film. The makers want to reveal the new title with a bang because there is not much time left for the film to release. The new posters and the title of the film will be out soon, but we can tell you that it is not very different from the earlier title of the film and has a twist,” says a trade source.

While it was also being speculated that the film will have a reshoot, nothing of that sort has happened. “Prakash Kovelamudi stays as the director of the film. After the Manikarnika controversy, where director Krish had to share the maker credit with Kangana, it was being rumoured that producer Ekta Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut wanted a reshoot with Kangana as the director. But nothing of that sort has happened and everyone in the film continue to do their jobs,” adds the source.
