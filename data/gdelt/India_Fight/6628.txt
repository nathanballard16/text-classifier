Chennai: The Chengalpattu Mahila Court has handed down the death sentence to Ashok Kumar who had murdered a child by slashing her neck, after sexually assaulting her two years ago. A fine of Rs 25,000 has also been imposed on the convict.

Ashok Kumar, aged 24, used to frequent the house of an uncle of his in Alandur, Chennai. A 13-year-old girl studying in Class 9 used to stay in a house opposite to his uncle’s. He has been observing this girl every time he visited his uncle’s house.

One day, after ensuring that there was no one in the girl’s house, Ashok Kumar, forcefully assaulted her, covered her mouth with a piece of cloth so that her screams could not be heard. Not only did he rape the child but he also slashed her neck with a knife and killed her. Police later informed that he was under the influence of liquor at that time.

Following this ghastly incident, Ashok Kumar was apprehended and a case was registered against him. This case came for appeal at the Mahila Court. The Court, on Friday, handed down the maximum sentence of death by hanging and a fine of Rs 25,000 on Ashok Kumar for murdering the 13-year-old girl.

It may be pertinent to note that this same Mahila Court had passed a similar death sentence to Dashvanth for sexually assaulting a 7-year girl child and then buried her body. He had killed his mother too.
