We forgive, says head priest of St Anthony's church which was attacked by terrorists in Sri Lanka

St Anthony’s church, Kochchikade, Sri Lanka was one of the places were bomb went off killing many. Built in 1828, it has historic significance. Our principal diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal, who is in Sri Lanka, spoke to the head priest of the church Father Jude Fernando, who not only called for forgiveness but not to seek revenge in the aftermath of the worst terror attack Sri Lanka has seen.

Question: What will you say to people who committed the crime?

Fr Jude Fernando: We love peace. We forgive. Our God is God of peace, he is not the God of revenge. We love each other, we forgive. Can't understand why this has happened. We will build the Church but can't bring back the lives.

Question: Church will be back again?

Fr Jude Fernando: We will do our best. Right now investigations are going. Not planned anything, once investigations are over, we will do something. Certainly, we will build back the church again.

Question: What happened on Sunday?

Fr Jude Fernando: It was easter mass at 8 am. Then I was in my office and at 8.45 am blast happened. I can’t even imagine the sound is like. With the help of protest and community, we sent all casualties to the hospital as soon as possible. And now, investigations are on. Massive damage has happened to the church. The entire roof is gone. It's unimaginable and unthinkable what really happened. Humble request is to maintain calm.

Question: Tell us the history of the church?

Fr Jude Fernando: This Church goes back to the Dutch period. This church was built by a priest from India. He came from Cochin, father Antonino. It's a place of peace and harmony, its a house of prayer. It has sentimental value and close to the heart of the people here. Our message is, please forgive and prayer for one another. Our God, is not the God of revenge and he is God of peace. I appeal, please be calm.
