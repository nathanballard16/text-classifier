Hina Khan heads to shoot with ‘Puffy eyes’ & ‘Less sleep’ but her Tuesday mantra has got us all pumped

Hina Khan has been literally, living out of a suitcase because post making her debut at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival, this talented actress has been jumping from one film set to another. Post unveiling the poster of her debut film- Lines at Cannes, Hina Khan jetted off somewhere in the North of India to shoot for her first international project. Thereafter, Hina Khan started shooting for Vikram Bhatt’s Hacked in Mumbai and it was only yesterday that Hina Khan posted a BTS picture from the sets of the show wherein Hina is seen slaying in an LBD while the director is conversing with her.

Post the Mumbai schedule of the film, Hina Khan will jet off to Lucknow for the second schedule of the film but before that, a few days back, this former Bigg Boss contestant shared the first look of her upcoming Indo- Hollywood project, The Country of the Blind. In the film, Hina will essay the role of a blind girl named Gosha and the film is based on the book by HG Wells of the same name and alongside the photo, Hina wrote, “Meet Gosha. My first Indo-Hollywood project, directed by our very own and talented Rahat Kazmi.”

And today, after returning from Kolkata last night, Hina Khan pushed herself out of the bed to go to shoot and alongside a series of goofy selfies which were clicked in the car, Hina wrote, “Puffy eyes.Less sleep and no escape..Well that’s ok Coz dreams don’t work unless you do..cheers..Good Morning.”
