Shimla, February 26

BJP state president Satpal Singh Satti today congratulated the Indian Air Force (IAF) for destroying Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camps at Balakot and other areas in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

BJP chief spokesperson Randheer Sharma said there was growing impatience among Indians due to increasing terrorist activities in the country. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already given a free hand to the forces to take necessary action against the backdrop of the Pulwama terror strike that left 40 CRPF personnel dead.

ABVP activists burnt crackers and raised slogans expressing their happiness. However, ABVP activists alleged that while the Kotshera college unit of the wing was celebrating the air strikes, SFI activities attacked them, leaving two students injured.

SFI leaders also accused ABVP men of attacking them and said four students sustained injuries in the clash initiated by the ABVP. — TNS

India has given a befitting reply to the Pulwama attack by striking terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The people of the nation are celebrating it as a Diwali. The act has proved that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is sensitive towards people and the country’s security. — PK Dhumal, former Chief Minister

The air strikes on terror camps have proved the strong willpower of the Centre. This is a new India, which will not spare any intrusion on its land. The action of Air Force fighters has not only reflected its power over the enemy, but also infused confidence among the people. — Anurag Thakur, MP
