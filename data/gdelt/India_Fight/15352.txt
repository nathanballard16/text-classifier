BSF-civilian clash leaves 24 injured in Tripura border

Agartala: At least 24 people, including two border guards, were injured when BSF personnel resorted to baton charge on villagers for allegedly trying to help smugglers in despatching cows to Bangladesh on Friday evening at Putia village of Sonamura in Sepahijala district.

An official report said that the BSF found some people trying to cut the wire fencing along Indo-Bangladesh border and tried to stop them.

Initially they challenged the border guard personnel and attacked the BSF jawans that left two personnel – Md Siddiqur Rehaman and Md Amin injured.

Meanwhile, a group of villagers rushed in to support the smugglers.

Within 10 minutes BSF reinforcements reached the spot and resorted to a baton charge in retaliation.

The smugglers managed to escape while the cows were released by the civilians. The report said that a group of youths of the village have been involved in smuggling for a long time but BSF could not identify them.

They have a criminal gang inside India and on the other side of the border in Bangladesh.

Salema Khatun, who was injured in the incident, alleged that they did not know about smuggling activities but came out from the house after hearing the commotion.

She accused the jawans of entering their house and manhandling the women and children.

Four children appearing for the Madhyamik examination were also beaten up mercilessly by BSF.

Later, police reached the area and took control of the situation. Altogether 10 injured persons were taken to Agartala Government Medical College.

Senior BSF officials also visited the area and held a meeting with the villagers in an effort to maintain peace. (UNI)
