C'garh Cong holds statewide protests against Centre, UP govt

The Chhattisgarh Congress on Saturday staged protests in all district headquarters in the state against the Centre on various issues, including curtailment of subsidised kerosene quota and rise in fuel prices.

They also attacked the Union government for the lowly 3.7 per cent hike in minimum support price of paddy.

Addressing the protest at Gandhi Chowk here, state Congress Chief Mohan Markam said Chhattisgarh was receiving step-motherly treatment from the Narendra Modi government.

"The minimum support price (MSP) of paddy was not increased significantly. The Centre has reduced quota of kerosene oil allocated to poor families in the state. It has also stopped 'dal bhaat' centres being run for the poor," he alleged.

He also hit out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh for not allowing Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to meet relatives of the victims of Wednesday's clash in Sonbhadra in the northern state.

Ten people were killed and 18 injured in a clash between supporters of the village head and Gond tribals over a piece of land in Sonbhadra's Ghorawal area on Wednesday.

He said the BJP government had become "brutal and oppressive".

Congress MLAs, workers from its district units, Youth Congress and National Students Union of India took part in the protests.
