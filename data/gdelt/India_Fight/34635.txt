The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill 2019, which seeks to expand the powers and jurisdiction of the NIA.

New offences in Schedule

The NIA has powers to investigate the offences listed in the Schedule of the NIA Act, which now includes offences under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,1967, Atomic Energy Act, 1962, Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982, Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms on Continental Shelf Act, 2002 etc.

The Bill proposes to add more offences in the Schedule such as :

Human trafficking (Sections 370, 370A of Indian Penal Code 1860)

Offences related to counterfeit currency (Sections 489A to 489E of Indian Penal Code 1860)

Manufacture or sale of prohibited arms (Section 25(1AA) of Arms Act,1959)

Cyber crimes (Section 66F Information Technology Act 2000)

Explosives Substances Act 1908



Extra territorial powers

The Bill seeks to give powers to NIA to investigate scheduled offences committed outside, subject to international treaties and domestic laws.

The Central Government can direct NIA to investigate such offences as if they were committed in India. The Special Court at New Delhi will have jurisdiction to try those cases.

Special Courts

Section 11 of the Act is sought to be amended to enable Central Government to notify a Court of Session as Special NIA Court after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.

Speaking during the discussion of the Bill, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said "All political parties, members of Parliament and the Government must come together to fight terror without pointing fingers at each other, otherwise it would boost the morale of the terrorists."

The opposition members alleged the Government of 'misusing' NIA.
