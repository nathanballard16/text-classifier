Army to add muscle with 72,000 US rifles

NEW DELHI: India is all set to ink a contract for 72,400 new assault rifles for its frontline infantry soldiers from the US for around Rs 700 crore under the fast-track procurement (FTP) route.Defence ministry sources on Saturday said the contract for the 7.62mm rifles with US firm SiG Sauer should be inked in “a week or so”, while another FTP case for 93,895 close-quarter battle (CQB) carbines from UAE company Caracal is in the pipeline. “Once the contracts are inked, the deliveries will take place within a year,” said an official.The FTP route is only for limited numbers of weapons due to critical operational necessity. The overall requirement of the armed forces, primarily the 13-lakh strong Army, is for 8.16 lakh new 7.62mm assault rifles to replace the existing, glitch-prone 5.56mm INSAS (Indian small arms system) rifles. The number for the CQB carbines is 4.58 lakh.The defence ministry had issued the RFPs (request for proposals) for the limited number of assault rifles and carbines, which will equip soldiers deployed along the borders with Pakistan and China, under the FTP route in March last year, as was first reported by TOI.The ministry has said the huge shortfall in basic infantry weapons will be met at a later stage with Indian companies (private ones as well as Ordnance Factory Board) tying up with foreign ones to manufacture them under the ‘Make in India’ framework, which could take at least four to five years to take off.
