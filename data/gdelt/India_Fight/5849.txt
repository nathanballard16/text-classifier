Pulwama attack HIGHLIGHTS: Rajnath Singh hits out at ‘elements’ in Valley funded by ISI, Pakistan

Kashmir Pulwama Terror Attack LIVE News Updates: India on Friday issued a very strong demarche to Pakistan in connection with the terror attack on a CRPF convoy in which 40 security personnel lost their lives in south Kashmir’s Pulwama yesterday. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale summoned Pakistan High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood and asked him to initiate immediate action against Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a Pakistan-based terror outfit, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Earlier in the day, a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took stock of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and decided to take diplomatic action to isolate Pakistan on an international level. Briefing reporters after attending the CCS meet, senior Cabinet minister Arun Jaitley announced that the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan stands withdrawn.

PM Modi, at an event, also said that those who committed the heinous act will pay “a heavy price”. “To all my colleagues, in ruling and Opposition, it’s a sensitive time. We need to speak in one voice because this battle is for us to win,” he said.
