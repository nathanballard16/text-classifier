Fire breaks out at rubber unit on Kanganwal Road

Ludhiana: A fire broke out at a rubber factory on Kanganwal Road on Tuesday. Drums of lubricants kept on the premises triggered the blaze, which was controlled within an hour.

Firemen said they received a call from Gobind Rubber Limited Unit-2 at 1.52pm. “Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot, as it was a rubber factory. But when we reached there, we found drums full of lubricants kept on the terrace of the factory were burning. One fire tender was enough to douse the flames,” said a fireman.

There was no one in the factory, expect a few labourers, when the incident took place. “Due to non-payment of a loan, banks have sealed the factory. The labourers were taking out drums of lubricants and other material when the fire broke out. They rushed out and sounded the fire department. Timely action contained its spread. The situation was brought under control around 3pm,” said station fire official SN Sharma.

Meanwhile, a minor fire incident was reported from Dashmesh Nagar on Monday night when an LPG cylinder caught fire at a house. Panic spread in the locality as residents gathered at the spot. Even as the fire department was informed, the house owner and the area people contained the blaze before firemen reached there.
