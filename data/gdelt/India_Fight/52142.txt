Watch: Bundles of Rs 2,000, Rs 500 notes rain from Kolkata building as DRI raids premises

It was peculiar sight in Kolkata when currency notes started raining out of a building. Money was thrown out of the sixth floor of a building on Bentinck Street in Kolkata while officials from Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) were conducting a search in a private office on the floor.

Video clips show currency notes of denominations of Rs 2,000, Rs 500 and Rs 100 being pushed out of a sixth floor window with a floor wiper. Bystanders made bank as they collected fistfuls of currency notes raining from up above.

DRI officials had gone to search the office of an import-export company over allegations of duty evasion, PTI reported. Reinforcements were sent after the money rain incident and the search continued.

However, a definite link could not be established between the currency note shower and DRI search operations, PTI quoted sources as saying. Meanwhile, police has started investigations in the matter.
