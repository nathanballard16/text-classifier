Mother is gang-raped by four men in India because her husband is a politician

A woman has been gang-raped by four men in India because her husband is a politician.

The victim, who has not been named, was attacked on Wednesday in West Bengal as she walked home after dropping her son off at a private tutor.

She told local media that four masked men shoved a handkerchief into her mouth before dragging her into a nearby construction site where she was raped.

During the attack the men also threatened to kill her husband because he is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The husband, who is also a priest, told OpIndia: 'I had been with BJP for years now. I take part in party campaigns and was also their booth agent in the elections.

'I have faced threats before. But I never realised they will target my wife for my political leanings.'

BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha laid the blame squarely at the feet of the Trinamool Congress, which controls West Bengal.

He also blamed the party for the deaths of three BJP workers in the state, two of whom were found strung up and a third bound and thrown into a lake.

BJP president Amit Shah said: 'TMC shames humanity, yet again. Another BJP worker killed in the most barbaric manner.

'[Under this] regime, West Bengal has become an epitome of violence & brutality.

'The entire BJP stands firmly with the worker's family in this hour of grief. My deepest condolences.'
