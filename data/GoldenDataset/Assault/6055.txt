Advertisement ban on IOK dailies condemned

New Delhi, April 05, 2019 (PPI-OT): The General Secretary of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union, Aijaz Ahmed Rathar, has said that extending ban of advertisement to Urdu daily Kashmir Uzma after English dailies ‘Greater Kashmir’ and ‘Kashmir Reader’ by the authorities is a direct assault on the freedom of speech.

Aijaz Ahmed Rathar in an e-mailed statement said, “Media, the fourth pillar of democracy, has a significant task of bringing grievances of people to the fore. Such apathy and discrimination towards the Kashmir media in a democratic set-up are unacceptable.”

He said the authorities are duty-bound to respect the freedom of press and the right of people to receive information. “The attempts are being made to interfere in the freedom of the press by exerting financial pressure. This censorship has put the question mark on the credibility of local administration,” he added.

He deplored that the ban would add to the miseries and sufferings media in occupied Kashmir and must be revoked to end hardships faced by media community in the territory.

On the other hand, a spokesman of Islami Tanzeem-e-Azadi in a statement issued in Srinagar condemned the ban of advertisements to daily newspapers in occupied Kashmir and described it a dictatorial move to curb freedom of expression. He said the authorities banned advertisements to these newspapers because they were exposing the real face of India to the world.
