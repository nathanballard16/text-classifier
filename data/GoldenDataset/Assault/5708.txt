In Another Sickening Case Of Bestiality A Man Was Caught Raping Newborn Pups, Arrested

There's apparently no limit to how low man can fall. There's a special Hell for lowlifes who rape and assault innocent animals that cannot speak.

In a sickening incident, a man in Chennai has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting four newborn puppies. The 30-year-old man identified as Bhaskar, a Madhavaram resident, was caught on CCTV performing the unspeakable act in an empty ground at Mathur near Madhavaram on March 14.

Sai Vignesh, an animal rights activist told Deccan Chronicle that Bhaskar is a repeat offender.

He was seen sexually abusing pups at the second cross street in MMDA colony last month, said Vignesh adding that passersby lashed out. Bhaskar was again seen sexually abusing puppies at the empty ground near Madhavaram.

At the time of Vigneshs' initial complaint, a senior inspector with the Chennai police had told The New Indian Express that the nature of the crime is unclear and even the CCTV footage didn't seem to be a substantial proof!

Following this heinous canine brutality, animal rights activist Sai Vignesh's police complaint led to his arrest on March 27, nearly two weeks after the report.

Bhaskar has been booked under section 294 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which corresponds to charges of performing obscene acts in public. As per the latest reports, Bhaskar has been remanded to prison awaiting further inquiry.
