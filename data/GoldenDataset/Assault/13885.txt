ICE captures Honduran fugitive criminal alien released by Mecklenburg County despite rape and child sex offense charges

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested fugitive Oscar Pacheco-Leonardo, 33, a Honduran national, and repeat immigration violator during a targeted enforcement operation in Mecklenburg County August 9, nearly two months after the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office refused to honor an ICE detainer, or even notify ICE of the release, and instead released Mr. Pacheco’s from local criminal custody following his arrest on first-degree rape and indecent liberties with a minor charges.

By releasing a previously deported alien facing serious criminal charges, Mecklenburg County chose to release a serious public safety threat onto the streets of Charlotte where he was free to potentially harm others for nearly two months until his capture by ICE.

Mr. Pacheco was previously removed from the U.S. to Honduras in July 2006, and he subsequently illegally reentered the U.S. after deportation, which is a felony act under federal law. After the resolution of any potential federal criminal charges, he is subject to removal again to Honduras.

Mr. Pacheco was arrested by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department for First Degree Rape and two counts of Indecent Liberties with a Child on June 14. ICE issued a detainer June 15, but the detainer was not honored, and Mr. Pacheco was instead released from Mecklenburg County custody June 16.

ICE’s Charlotte Fugitive Operations Team (FUGOPS) located and arrested the man without incident August 9 and he remains in ICE custody.

“This is yet another example of a clear public safety threat being released onto the streets of Mecklenburg County rather than into ICE custody due to the current sheriff’s policy on ICE non-cooperation,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Atlanta Field Office Director Sean Gallagher. “The Mecklenburg County sheriff’s decision to restrict cooperation with ICE serves as an open invitation to aliens who commit criminal offenses that Mecklenburg County is a safe haven for persons seeking to evade federal authorities, and residents of Mecklenburg County are less safe today than last year due these policies.”

This arrest is simply the latest in a continuing list of unlawfully present foreign nationals released from Mecklenburg County custody over the past nine months despite serious criminal charges that pose a clear threat to public safety.

About Detainers

Detainers serve as a legally authorized request, upon which a law enforcement agency may rely, to continue to maintain custody of an alien for up to 48 hours so that ICE may assume custody for removal purposes. Pursuant to ICE policy, all ICE detainers are submitted with an accompanying administrative arrest warrant or warrant of removal depending upon the circumstances of the individual case. ICE places immigration detainers when the agency possesses probable cause to believe an alien is removable from the United States.

When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release a criminal alien onto the streets, it negatively impacts public safety.
