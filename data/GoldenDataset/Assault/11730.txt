Mumbai actress alleges rape, assault by ex-boyfriend

A Mumbai-based actress-model has filed a case against her former boyfriend for allegedly raping and assaulting her, a Times of India report said on Monday.

According to the report, the 26-year-old complainant had met the accused, a 34-year-old actor-model, during a shoot in 2017.

The accused, who is based in Noida, used to travel to Mumbai regularly to meet the complainant, the police said. He did not tell her that he was married and forced her into a physical relationship, after promising to marry her, the complainant told the police.

The complainant alleged that the accused then asked her keep a distance from her friends and not work with any male actors or models. If she did not listen to him, he verbally abused her and also beat her up, she said.

"We have registered an FIR on Saturday under IPC sections 376 (2) (n), 323, 504 and 506 against the accused. He is not in Mumbai at present and we are looking for him," said a police officer.
