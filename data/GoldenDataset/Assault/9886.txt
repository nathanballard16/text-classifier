RDA advances 48-hour ultimatum to Mamata Didi, ask her to fulfil demands

National Capital’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences’ (AIIMS) Resident Doctors Association on Saturday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal, asking her to fulfil the demands of the junior doctors agitating in solidarity with the doctors who faced assault.

The Resident Doctors said if their demands are not accepted, they will be forced to go on an indefinite strike.

The agitating doctors have demanded the CM to furnish an unconditional apology for the manner she addressed the doctors at SSKM hospital. Also they have demanded that she should visit the injured doctors and issue a statement condemning their assault. The doctors have also demanded to withdraw all the false charges against junior doctors and have asked for documentary evidence and details of the action against the assaulters.

The ultimatum from the Resident Doctors of AIIMS has come even as Mamata Banerjee has called on the agitating doctors to have a meeting with her on Saturday again in order to call off their protest. The protesting junior doctors have found an immense support from their colleagues all over the country and the protest has hit the healthcare services in private and government hospitals as well.
