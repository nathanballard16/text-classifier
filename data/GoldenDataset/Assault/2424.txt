CBI Probe ordered against Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

Patna: CBI probe has been ordered against Bihar CM Nitish Kumar by a special court on the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (POCSO) today in connection with the Bihar shelter home rape cases.

The Special court also ordered an inquiry against Muzaffarpur district magistrate Dharmendra Singh and principal secretary of Social Welfare Atul Prasad, News18 reports.

Earlier the SC had transferred the sexual abuse of inmates at Muzaffarpur home shelter trial to the Saket Court in New Delhi after Nitish Governemnt failed to submit details of shelter homes in Bihar.

The bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, said the cases should be transferred from the Bihar CBI court to a POCSO Saket trial court within two weeks.

The top court also ordered the Saket trial court to conclude the trial within six months.

The apex court also said that the CBI’s action of transferring its officer probing the sexual assault case amounted to a violation of its order.

The bench asked the investigating agency to file an affidavit giving an explanation into the matter.

CJI Gogoi continued: “Enough is enough. Children cannot be treated like this. You cannot let your officers treat children this way. Spare the children.”

In November last year, the Apex court had transferred as many as 16 cases related to the sexual and mental exploitation of children in Bihar shelter homes to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) directing the investigation agency to file a status report by January 31.

The court has now said the trial should be completed in 6 months and no extension of time should be sought.
