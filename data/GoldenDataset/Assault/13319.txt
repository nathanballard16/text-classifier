File affidavit on action taken against nail assault on trees: HC

Corpn. asked to spell out its statutory powers to curb the abuse

The Madras High Court on Monday directed Greater Chennai Corporation to file an affidavit within a week listing out the statutory powers that had been conferred upon it to take action against those who nail trees for affixing advertisement boards or to hang overhead cables and wires.

Justices S. Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad also wanted Director of Information and Publicity to spell out what action could he take on the issue since the issue of “nail assault on trees” flagged by a public interest litigation petitioner appeared to be serious and worthy of consideration.

B. Jayalakshmi of Sneham Trust had filed the PIL petition accusing the Greater Chennai Corporation as well as the Chennai city police of having failed to effectively act against those who nail trees on public roads indiscriminately for displaying advertisement boards and other such purposes.

Emphasizing that nailing causes great harm to the trees, the petitioners sought for a direction to the Chief Secretary to act against the act.

Replying to one of her representations, the government officials in October last claimed that the Corporation was acting against such assault.

However, when she insisted on obtaining a copy of the circular reportedly issued by the Corporation in this regard to the Ward Engineers in all 15 zones, she did not get any reply and hence the present PIL petition. She claimed that nailing the trees affects their growth drastically.
