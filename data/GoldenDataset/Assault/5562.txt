New Delhi, Mar 26: Congress has announced structure of a minimum income guarantee scheme, which according to the party is going to be a final assault on poverty.

Termed as Nyay (justice), the scheme offers Rs 12,000 per month for a family (upto Rs 72,000 per year) as basic income.

Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi claimed that this "is an extremely powerful, ground-breaking and well-thought through idea". While all this sounds good, only time will tell if this is just another election promise or a serious policy proposal.
