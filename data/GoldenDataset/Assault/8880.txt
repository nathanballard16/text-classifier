Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar will be held accountable: Samsam Bukhari

"PPP and PML-N are united, and these parties want to save their corruption," he said.

LAHORE (Dunya News) – Punjab Information Minister Samsam Bukhari said on Monday that Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar –members of the National Assembly (NA) who led a group to assault Kharqamar check post in Boyya, North Waziristan, on Sunday – will be held accountable according to the constitution of Pakistan.

He addressed a press conference in Lahore, and asserted that a stern action would be taken against whosoever acts as an enemy of the state.

Bukhari strongly condemned statements of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) over the matter, and said that the question was asked from Bilawal regarding outbreak of HIV in Sindh, however, his answer was about Mohsin Dawar.

“The spread of HIV in Larkana is a matter of grave concern for Pakistan,” he said, adding that Maryam has tweeted in favour of those who had attacked Pakistan Armed Forces.

“PPP and PML-N are united, and these parties want to save their corruption,” he said.

“Everyone is allowed to participate in politics, but it shouldn’t be done against the country. The army and the government are not separate [from each other] as the army is an institution of the state,” Bukhari maintained.

He stated that it is their responsibility to expose miscreants who live here [in Pakistan] and speak on behalf of the enemies.

“It is not possible to hold talks with India without the issue of Kashmir,” he said, adding that if India is ready [for talks], so is Pakistan.
