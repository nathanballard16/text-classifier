Haryana: Kid fakes abduction for 'ransom'

A Palwal district's Class 12 student, along with three friends, landed himself in jail after he concocted a plan to abduct himself and demanded Rs 50 lakh as ransom from his father.



Initially, the police registered a case of a missing person based on the complaint by the student's father Chaman Prakash, however, the investigation by the Palwal crime investigation agency (CIA) and cyber cell led them to the student, Jatin, himself. Thereafter, Jatin and his associates were arrested from Faridabad and produced in court and granted a two-day police remand.



DSP Suresh Kumar said that Chaman, a resident of village Mandkoul, had lodged a complaint on September 23 that his son Jatin left the house without mentioning anything two days ago and was no nowhere to be found. The complaint said that Jatin was last seen with Pawan and Hari Om, who were also missing since. He then received a call on September 25, demanding Rs 50 lakh as ransom for his son's safe return.



The investigation was then handed over to CIA and cyber cell, who using the phone numbers used to contact Prakash, tagged Jatin and his friends' location on Friday near Milan Hotel.



During interrogation, Jatin claimed that his father did not let him out of the house, nor did he give money for expenses, so he and his friends hatched the plan to get their hands on some money.
