Commando actor Vidyut Jammwal acquitted in 12-year-old assault case

Commando actor Vidyut Jammwal was today acquitted by Bandra magistrate court in a 12-year-old assault case. He had been accused of attacking a businessman in 2007. The court has stated "lack of evidence" as the cause of acquittal.

In the intervening night of August 31 and September 1, 2007, Jammwal was partying with his friends at the Grand Hayatt hotel in Mumbai. According to the complaint filed with the police, Rahul Suri, a Juhu-based businessman, allegedly accidently pushed Jamwal’s friends while they were coming out of the hotel. This, according to them, led to a fist fight between them, and Suri alleged that Jammwal too beat him up and smashed a bottle on his head.

Jammwal was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt, rioting, armed with a weapon and being part of an unlawful assembly. Jammwal and his model friend Hrishant Goswami were charged with common intention too. During the long-stretched trial, Jamwal did not turn up in court despite many summons sent to him. It was only after a non-bailable warrant was issued that he finally came to court. He had also pleaded not guilty, because of which the court started the trial against him.

The prosecution examined two witnesses, in which one of the Panch (witnesses) had turned hostile, while the police officer too allegedly did not help the prosecution case. Advocate Aniket Nikam, who represented Jammwal, said, "My clients were innocent. There was no satisfactory evidence before the court to hint towards my client's involvement in the alleged incident of assault. They have been acquitted."
