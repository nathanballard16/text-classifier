Bail of two cancelled over fake torture charges against police

A Delhi court has cancelled the bail of two accused for faking torture at the hands of police officials while being brought to court in south-west Delhi.

Additional Sessions Judge Sonu Agnihotri cancelled the bail of accused Vikas and Vikas Puri.

When the two appeared before the court, one bare-chested and the other with torn vest, the Judge enquired about their appearance. In reply, they blamed the officials accompanying them. But in a video shown by the lock-up in-charge to the court, the accused were seen trying to harm themselves.

“Conduct of accused persons is depreciable... From today onwards, they are in custody in the present case,” the Judge said.

“Accused have tried to create evidence so that action will be taken against police officials taking them to the court. The officials did not accede to their demand of handcuffing them in a particular manner, which is against law,” the Judge further said.

The court also asked DCP (Dwarka) to submit a report regarding the incident as well as the charges levelled by the accused against the police officials.
