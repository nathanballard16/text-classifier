Monkey takes Indian bank employee 'hostage' – sitting on his back before getting VERY amorous

This is the bizarre moment that a monkey appears to take an Indian bank employee hostage by sitting on his back - before humping him.

The animal bares its sharp teeth at anyone people watching as it sits on the head and neck of the man in Axis Bank in Nirman Vihar, New Delhi, India.

The terrified man looks up briefly before keeping his head on his desk and staying still as the monkey draws laugh by humping his back.

The animal then sits upright and looks around the room before pushing its arms down and humping the man again.

But, having drawn the audience, the monkey eventually gets bored and jumps off the employee's back and on to the floor.

One local said: 'The customers watched this incident with amusement and they laughed at the action of the monkey.

'He also tried to hump the workers head a few times before leaving.'
