Ahmedabad: Druggie teen stabs father, beats mother

A 17-year-old boy attacked his parents on Monday for allegedly withholding drugs from him. They refused to lodge a police complaint, even as one of them lay on a hospital bed, fearing it would affect his future. However, on Wednesday, when he threatened them even in the hospital, they went to Meghaninagar police.



Monday's incident took place at the family's home in Chamanpura at 8 am. The 43-year-old man overheard his son arguing with his mother, accusing her of hiding his drugs. The argument took a violent turn as the son began beating his mother and threw a stool at her. The man, who works in an embroidery factory, intervened and slapped his son.



In retaliation, the teenager grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed him in the stomach. Hearing a call for help, neighbours rushed over, but the son fled.



The man was admitted to a private hospital. The son went over and threatened to kill his parents if they stopped him from doing drugs.



Police investigation revealed that the teenager has a tendency to get violent and is an addict. "We have arrested the boy and he will be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board," said Police sub-inspector J.B Chaudhari of Meghaninagar police station.
