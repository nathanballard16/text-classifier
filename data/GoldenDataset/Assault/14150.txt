"P Chidambaram is a legal luminary. The case is a clear case of political vendetta," MK Stalin, president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was quoted as saying by news channels. Stalin is also the leader of the Opposition in Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

Stalin comments follow Congress president Rahul Gandhi where he said, "Modi's govt is using the ED, CBI & sections of a spineless media to character assassinate Mr Chidambaram. I strongly condemn this disgraceful misuse of power."

The Delhi High Court had on Tuesday refused to grant any protection from arrest to Chidambaram in the INX Media case, following which the CBI issued a notice to him asking him to appear before the investigation officer "within two hours" after failing to find him at his residence.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has also issued a fresh lookout circular against the former Union minister.
