Seized bombs stored at Forest Department office in Pune explode; no casualties

The explosives were confiscated from poachers who use them to hunt wild animals

A major explosion, allegedly caused by confiscated handmade bombs used to hunt wild animals, ripped through the office of the Maharashtra State Forest Department early on Wednesday.

No casualties were reported as the office, located 30 km from Pune, was closed at the time of the blast, authorities said.

According to the Pune rural police, the incident occurred between 4 a.m. and 4.30 a.m.

Around 90 small, crude, handmade bombs, commonly used by poachers and local villagers, which were seized by forest authorities, were stored in the office. These are believed to have caused the explosion, said officials.

Such was the intensity of the blast that the shutter of the office was cast off several feet away from the premises.

Furniture and walls were damaged and a number of files are believed to have been destroyed.

“These handmade ‘bombs’ comprise of explosive powder, small pellets and stones and are used by poachers in their hunting of wildlife. Around 90 such bombs were seized from the Tamhini Wildlife Sanctuary by forest officials sometime back. They were stored at the Forest Department’s rented office in Paud,” Ashok Dhumal, Police Inspector, Paud Police Station, told The Hindu.

He further said that the blast may have been triggered due to improper storage of these confiscated substances or by rodents.

“The intensity of the blast was high and it is fortunate it did not occur during office hours. We are probing into the causes of the blast,” said Mr. Dhumal, stating that besides poachers, local villagers also often used them to kill stray dogs.

Forest Department authorities have launched a separate investigation into the blast.
