IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman returns home: A timeline

Varthaman ejected across the Line of Control and was captured by local residents who later handed him over to the Pakistan Army.

Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was in Islamabad’s custody for nearly 60 hours, was handed over to Indian authorities at Wagah Border by Pakistan on Friday. Attired in civilian clothes, he walked across the Zero Line at 9.20 pm as the Pakistan Rangers handed him over to the BSF. He was whisked away by IAF personnel, and the hundreds who had gathered there to welcome him failed to catch a glimpse.

Amritsar Deputy Commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon told reporters that the pilot said he was happy to be back in his country.

Amidst heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had Thursday announced that the IAF officer would be released on Friday. The Wing Commander was in Pakistan Army’s custody after his MiG-21 aircraft was hit by ground air defence weapons when he engaged with Pakistan’s jets that had violated Indian air space over Nowshera and Krishna Ghati sectors of Rajouri and Poonch districts in Jammu and Kashmir.

The Indian Air Force expressed happiness over Vardhaman being repatriated to India. “It is a gesture in consonance with the Geneva conventions,” Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor said Thursday.

On Wednesday, Pakistan Air Force aircraft (PAF) violated Indian airspace in J&K and attempted air strikes but caused little damage on the ground as the bombs fell in uninhabited areas near military installations.

India had on Tuesday conducted non-military pre-emptive air strikes on a terror camp in Balakot, in the wake of Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF men were killed. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale, in a press briefing, had earlier said that the Balakot airstrikes were not against Pak military and only against JeM terror training camps. He had said it was a pre-emptive step against further terror bids in India.
