Pakistan Violates Ceasefire Again In Jammu And Kashmir

Pakistani troops violated ceasefire in Mendhar, Rajouri and Nowshera sectors.

Pakistan violated ceasefire for the second time on Thursday and resorted to unprovoked firing and heavy shelling of mortars along the Line of Control in Krishna Ghati sector. This is the seventh consecutive day that Pakistan has violated the ceasefire by targeting forward posts along the LoC.

Earlier this morning, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire in Mendhar, Rajouri and Nowshera sectors; Mendhar and Balakote sectors witnessed heavy shelling throughout night also.

The PRO, Defence said, "At about 0600 hours on Thursday, Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by shelling with mortars and firing of small arms along the LoC in Krishna Ghati sector".

"The Indian Army retaliated strongly and effectively", the official said.

On Wednesday, Pakistani Rangers violated ceasefire in Mendhar and Krishna Ghati sectors in the Rajouri district.

Last year, Pakistan violated ceasefire nearly 3,000 times - the highest by Pakistani troops in the last 15 years along the Indo-Pak border.

Pakistan continues to violate the ceasefire understanding of 2003 despite repeated calls for restraint and adherence to the agreement during flag meetings between the border-guarding forces of the two countries, the officials said.

Amid rising tension between India and Pakistan following the Pulwama terror attack and increasing ceasefire violations, the people along the Line of Control and the international border in this region are living under constant fear, they said.
