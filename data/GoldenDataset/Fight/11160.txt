India-Pakistan Clash Won't Get Out of Hand or Lead to Nuclear War – Journo

"War involves attrition," he explained. "Each day the conflict rolls on, there will be losses of aircraft, tanks, guns, fuel, ammunition and human lives on both sides. However, India having a larger and better equipped military will be able to replace war losses rapidly. Pakistan's economy cannot replace its losses as rapidly as most of its weapons are grants from the US. It cannot replace its F-16 fleet as the US has ended its annual aid [in September 2018] that amounted to millions of dollars".

Second, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is "a comparatively outdated and badly equipped service", according to Simha.

He pointed out that in the 1999 Kargil War, PAF aircraft stayed 30 km away from the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir because of Combat Air Patrol (CAP) by the Indian Air Force (IAF) MiG-29s.

"While other Indian aircraft pounded the Pakistan Army on the mountains in both Indian and Pakistani held Kashmir, the PAF was powerless to stop them," he said. "In the [Indo Pakistan War] of 1971, the IAF blew away the PAF in the first week of the war. After the first week the PAF did not enter Indian airspace and were limited to air defence".
