With the sort of weapons we both have, can we afford any miscalculation?” Those were Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan ’s words to India yesterday.While the world’s attention was focused on nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, one of the oldest and most unpredictable nuclear relationships has flared up: India and Pakistan. India’s recent strikes deep inside Pakistani territory, and Pakistan’s downing of Indian fighter jets may become the subcontinent’s “Archduke Ferdinand” moment.This is particularly dangerous because both countries have domestic audiences that are thirsty for blood. While many of Pakistan’s Islamists will be ready for holy war against the Hindu state, Narendra Modi ’s government – long-affiliated to the far-right (and formerly outlawed) RSS paramilitary group may be ready to escalate the conflict, against a backdrop of rising anti-Muslim hate across India.It is essential that the international community step in to avoid nuclear war in a region that has been neglected for too long. A peacekeeping force in Kashmir – the hotspot at the centre of tensions – should be a minimum.If the world cannot cool tensions in Kashmir, the region will always remain on the brink of war. As well as two states with huge, heavily armed, armies with an array of US and Chinese made conventional weapons (not to mention nuclear warheads), both countries have non-state actors that would likely keep any conflict going for years, if not decades.
