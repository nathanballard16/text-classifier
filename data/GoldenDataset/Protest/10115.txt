What Ashok Gehlot said about Rahul Gandhi ahead of Chief Ministerâ€™s meet with him?

New Delhi:

Ahead of his meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said that all the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states own the responsibility of the party’s humiliating defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Gehlot hailed Rahul Gandhi’s “unmatched” commitment towards the country and said that only he (Rahul) can lead the Congress party in the current situation.

"We firmly believe that only he can lead the party in the current scenario, his commitment towards well-being of our country and countrymen is un-compromised and unmatched," Gehlot said.

The Rajasthan chief minister further added that the 2019 Lok Sabha polls were not a defeat of the Congress party’s policy or ideology and it was only Rahul Gandhi who took the BJP head on and made the elections issue based.

"The 2019 election was not a defeat of program, policy and ideology of the Congress. Although, it was very unfortunate to see that despite the failure of Modi government on various fronts including the depleting economy. BJP did manage to hide their huge failures behind their fanatic nationalism wd help of enormous resources n govt machinery at hand. But,in spite all odds,it’s no secret how amidst opposition, only Congress Prez did his best to make it an issue based election n took BJP head on (sic)," he said in a series of tweets.

Gehlot’s statement came hours before the meeting of chief ministers of Congress-ruled states with Rahul Gandhi in a bid to convince him to take back his decision to quit as party chief. Over the last few days, several Congress leaders, holding key posts in the party, have quit taking responsibility of election defeat.

Leaders and workers of the Congress party are urging Rahul Gandhi to continue as party president, even as he remained firm on his decision. Several party workers on Monday sat on an indefinite hunger strike outside Congress headquarters in Delhi urging Rahul Gandhi to take back his resignation.
