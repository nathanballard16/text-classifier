No letup in demand for laptops

About 300 students, along with members of Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), staged a protest in front of MGR integrated bus stand here on Friday against the district administration for not issuing laptops to those who completed their school education in 2017-18.

It formed part of a week-long series of protests conducted by students now studying in colleges. K. Sathishkumar, a former student of Mangayarkarasi Higher Secondary School, said that most of the students could not afford to buy a laptop. “Students from our batch are the only ones who have been denied laptops even while our peers are making presentations on their own devices,” said K. Deepak, a student who studied in Sourashtra School.

Police asked the protesters to clear the area as they had not sought permission to stage the demonstration.

SFI’s Madurai district (urban) secretary S. Veldeva and DYFI’s joint secretary Charles were injured when police resorted to charge them with lathis. Mr. Veldeva was admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital after he sustained injuries. However, a senior police officer said that they only chased them away and denied there was lathi charge.
