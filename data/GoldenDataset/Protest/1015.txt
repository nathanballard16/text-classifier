Black flags greet Sonowal in Majuli

GUWAHATI: Black flags were waved at Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in Majuli on Monday as protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill continued unabated in the state.

Sonowal arrived at the river island by a helicopter in the morning to participate in an official function.

As soon as he landed, the agitators shouted slogans against him and the Union government, demanding the withdrawal of the controversial bill, which seeks to grant nationality to non-Muslims who fled religious persecution from three neighbouring countries and entered India before December 31, 2014.

Several protesters were taken into custody, while others were dispersed by the police.

On Sunday too, Sonowal was shown black flags by protesters of Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP) and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) outside Kaziranga University, where he had gone to attend the convocation ceremony.

The AJYCP members also tonsured their heads at Jamugurihat in Sonitpur district to register their protest. (Agencies)
