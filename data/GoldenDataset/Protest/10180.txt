Demand for high purity oxygen is witnessing a growth, due to increasing use of oxygen for the treatments of pollutants. Governments of various countries are focusing on adoption of high purity oxygen generators to simplify pollutant’s treatment procedure. This trend is more pronounced in regions that have increased population and widespread industrialization. With both industrial landscape in India and its population increasing at phenomenal pace, wastewater volume is further increasing at alarming growth. In addition, government of various economies has made it mandatory for all the hospitals to maintain a regular supply of oxygen in operation theatres, ICUs and wards. This is further likely to boost demand for high purity oxygen in foreseeable future.

Traditionally, oxygen cylinder were used in aircrafts for longer journey. However, present generation aircrafts have capabilities far in excess to human tolerance. Modern aircraft are capable of flying 6 Hr to 8 Hr with air to air refueling. In a bid to support requirements of these aircrafts key players have come up with on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS). Utilization of OBOGS in military aircrafts removes logistic tail linked with liquid or gaseous oxygen system. Such innovative systems are likely to increase demand for high purity oxygen generators.
