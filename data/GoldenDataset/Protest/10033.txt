Students protest Delhi varsity’s high cut-offs

Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 28Student organisations like Krantikari Yuva Sangathan and government school students today held a protest against the Delhi University (DU) administration for releasing sky-high cut-off list. Holding placards and chanting slogans against DU, they burnt a representational effigy of the cut-off list to highlight its discriminatory nature. A large number of government school students think this cut-off list has destroyed their chances of entering public-funded regular higher education institutions. According to the All-India Higher Education Survey released by the MHRD, only 25.2 per cent of the students who pass Class XII go for higher education.
