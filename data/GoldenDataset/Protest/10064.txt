Allahabad University replaces studentsâ€™ union with council, protests intensity

New Delhi:

The ongoing protest on the Allahabad University (AU) premises has intensified, the university’s Executive Council (EC) on Saturday decided to replace AU students’ union with students’ council.

The students, who have been protesting against the decision, on Saturday, gathered on the university campus in huge numbers and chanted slogans against the university administration. They also reportedly got into clashes with the policemen who have been posted in large numbers across the campus.

According to The Times of India, prior to approving the concept at AC on Monday, the AU authorities had submitted an affidavit in Allahabad High Court last month, informing the court of its decision which is in accordance with recommendations of the Lyngdoh committee.

"In accordance with the clause 6.1.2 of the Lyngdoh committee recommendations, wherein it is mentioned that 'whenever the atmosphere of the university campus is adverse to the conduct of peaceful, free and fair elections, the university must initiate a system of student representation based in nominations, especially where elections are being held at present', AU has given an affidavit in Allahabad High Court that the university would follow the system of student council," said AU PRO Chitranjan Kumar.

"The Academic Council held discussions on replacing the students' union with student council. Once approved by the EC, it would be implemented in AU," he added.

“We were protesting peacefully, but we were still detained by the police. We have been subjected to inhumane behaviour by the university administration. Today is a black day in the history of Allahabad University. We will continue our fight. We will go to the Ministry of Human Resource Development if we have to,” students’ union’s current general secretary Shivam Singh told NewsClick.

Richa Singh, former president of AU students’ union had called this decision a violation of fundamental rights of the students by the university administration. “Dissolving the students’ union is a violation of our fundamental rights. According to Article 19 (1) (c) of the Indian Constitution, all citizens have the right 'to form associations and unions'. Teachers, workers, doctors, all of them have unions. Then why are they taking this right away from us?” NewsClick quoted her as saying.
