Rahul Gandhi's 'supporter' tries to commit suicide outside Congress headquarters over his resignation

New Delhi:

A man claiming to be supporter of Rahul Gandhi attempted to commit suicide outside the Congress headquarters in New Delhi today. The man, who has not been identified so far, had brought a nylon rope to hang himself from the tree outside party office. "Rahul Gandhi should take back his resignation else I will hang myself," he reportedly said. The policemen whisked him away even as some sympathisers raise reportedly raised slogans of ‘Rahul Gandhi zindabad’.

The incident comes a day after Congress Chief ministers of Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry met Gandhi in a bid to ask him to reconsider his decision to withdraw his resignation. "It was a good meeting that lasted around two hours. We expressed our feelings and it was a heart-to-heart talk in detail. We conveyed and apprised him about the feelings of Congress workers across the country and urged him to continue to lead the party," Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told reporters after the meeting. There were reports that some Congress leaders were observing hunger strike to convince Gandhi.
