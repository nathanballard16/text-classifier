Delhi: Hindu Rao Hospital doctors protest attack on colleague, strike enters Day 2

On Saturday, a group of people including the husband and son of woman patient, Rajbala, 45, went on a rampage breaking furniture and equipment after they were informed of her death.

Resident doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital in Delhi are on a strike since Sunday after the family of a patient who died during treatment attacked their colleague on Saturday.

Only emergency services will be operational, a doctor said.

Dr Abhishek Bhatia, who works at Hindu Rao, said, "As long as this happens we won't do any work. Only emergency services and nothing else will be operational."

"A doctor was thrashed and injured here last night. The patient was not in a good condition, everything was explained, even then 10-15 people came and thrashed a doctor," he added.

On Saturday, a group of people including the husband and son of woman patient, Rajbala, 45, went on a rampage breaking furniture and equipment after they were informed of her death.

"Rajbala, suffering from a liver disease, was on a ventilator in a critical state. As soon as her husband and relatives were informed of her death, they damaged the hospital property alleging negligence in her treatment. They later manhandled Dr Jagmohan, who was treating her. To save himself, he locked himself in the nurses' room," a police officer said.

In a similar case, doctors in West Bengal were on a week-long strike after family members of a patient assaulted doctors at the NRS Medical college in Kolkata following the death of the patient. The protest became national news after doctors from other parts of the country joined the strike in solidarity with the junior doctors at NRS.

The strike came to an end after an hour-long meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
