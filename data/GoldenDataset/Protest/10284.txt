AIADMK workers protest against Bedi

They demand her recall

All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) cadre on Thursday staged a demonstration on Rangapillai Street to protest against the objectionable remarks made by Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi against politicians and public on the social media platform in the context of water crisis in Chennai.

The workers gathered near the Head Post Office and shouted slogans against Ms. Bedi.

They raised slogans demanding her immediate recall.

Addressing the workers, leader of the party in the Legislative Assembly A. Anbalagan said the Lt. Governor had overstepped her domain and insulted the people of Tamil Nadu.

The Lt. Governor would not have hesitated to make such disrespectful remarks had former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha been alive, he said.

The Lt. Governor had brought the administration of the Union Territory to a standstill. People of the Union Territory had been put to hardship due to her turf war with the ruling Congress, he said.
