Protest against power towers gathers pace

Tirupur: Protest against erecting high voltage power transmission towers on fertile lands has been gathering pace in the western districts of the state ever since the Madras High Court dismissed a plea that sought to stop the project.

In many places, farmers are trying to stop revenue and Power Grid Corporation of India officials from conducting surveys or erecting towers.

When officials entered farm lands in Veeranampalayam near Kangeyam taluk in Tirupur with police force, opposition parties DMK and CPI extended their support to the farmers, who participated in a consultation meeting attended by DMK deputy general secretary Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan on Wednesday.

“Authorities say the project is inevitable for the development of the country. But are they speaking of inclusive growth,” asked KV Ponnaiyan, coordinator of association of farmers opposing high tension tower transmission line.
