Protests in Patna over Assault on Swami Agnivesh in Jharkhand

Patna: Various groups in Patna on Wednesday took out protest marches against the brutal assault on Swami Agnivesh, a old social activist who was beaten up in Pakur in Jharkhand state on Tuesday by the alleged members of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP.

As reported, Swami Agnivesh had to be rushed to a nearby hospital after he suffered physical injuries following assault on him by a group of young men shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogan.

People in Patna under the banner of Nagrik Pratiwad March, took out a protest rally near Kargil Chowk condemning the incident and demanding the arrest of those who were engaged in such heinous act.

Another protest was taken out by the members of the All India Students Federation (AISF) at Patna University where they demanded a full enquiry into the incident and resignation of the security officials in Jharkhand for failing to protect the 78-year old civil activist.

The incident took place as soon as Agnivesh stepped out of his hotel at Pakur to take part in the 195th Damin Mahotsav in Littpara area in Pakur.

Reports said BJYM activists accused Agnivesh of being controlled by the Christian missionaries in the state who, they said, were attempting to rile up communal riot in the state ahead of next year's Lok Sabha elections.

Nearly two dozen youths were detained by the police but no arrest was made till the time of reporting.
