Farmers’ march

Scores of farmers from Sindh participated in a ‘long march’ to protest against the shortage of water they have been experiencing for the past few years. The farmers started their march from Kharo Chan, in Sindh, and reached Thatta after walking 150 kilometres. According to the farmers, they have been trying to draw the attention of the authorities concerned for years, but no action has been taken. Thousands of farmers and their families have moved away from their ancestral agricultural lands due to the unavailability of water. One can clearly see the impact of climate change as it strikes the fertile lands of Sindh. The region has thrived on agriculture for thousands of years, as is evident from the remnants of the Indus Valley Civilisation. However, the problem is partially man-made as well, as mismanagement of the water resources has led to this point. There is an urgent need to build dams to conserve water upstream and divert it south. The Sindh government needs to proactively deal with this and work on a plan to alleviate the water shortage in the region.Anjum HussainPublished in The Express Tribune, July 5, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
