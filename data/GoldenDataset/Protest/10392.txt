Pharma students’ silent protest in Vizag

Seek provision of jobs as ‘clinical pharmacists’ at hospitals

A silent protest was staged by pharmacy graduates, owing allegiance to the Doctor of Pharmacy Association, at the Gandhi Statue near Asilmetta on Sunday demanding provision of jobs to Pharm D graduates as ‘clinical pharmacists’ in government and private hospitals.

Doctor of Pharmacy Association State vice-president Hemant said that 7,000 Pharm D graduates in the State were unemployed for the past 10 years due to lack of opportunities. He appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to come to the aid of Pharm D graduates by appointing them as clinical pharmacists in government and private hospitals as was being done in neighbouring Odisha.

The association leader thanked YSRCP leader and Rajya Sabha Member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy for raising the issue of including Pharm D graduates in the National Medical Commission, in Parliament on several occasions.
