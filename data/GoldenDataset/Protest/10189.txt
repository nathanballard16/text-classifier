L-G has no right to call T.N. people selfish, cowardly: DMK

Political parties stage protest against Kiran Bedi for inflammatory tweet

Members of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam staged a demonstration on Tuesday to condemn Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for her remarks, which they felt were “disrespectful” to politicians and insulted the sentiments of people in Tamil Nadu.

Led by party leader in the Legislative Assembly R. Siva, the members gathered on Rangapillai Street and raised slogans against Ms. Bedi, demanding her immediate recall from the post. In a tweet on Sunday, the Lt. Governor blamed politicians, bureaucrats and people for the water crisis in Chennai.

Addressing the crowd, DMK leader R.T. Sabapathy Mohan said Ms. Bedi should be ready to face continued agitation if she failed to apologise within 24 hours.

The Prime Minister should recommend to the President to recall her as the Lt. Governor, he added. According to him, she had exceeded all her limits during her tenure in the Union Territory.

Administrative paralysis

Her day-to-day interference in its governance had led to administrative paralysis. The Chief Minister was forced to sit on a dharna in front of the Raj Nivas to protest against her style of functioning, Mr. Mohan recalled.

“Now, she has gone further by commenting on the affairs of Tamil Nadu and insulting the people there. She has no right to say that the people of Tamil Nadu are selfish and cowardly. It is an insult to them as a whole,” he said.

Veteran leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) T. Murugan said the Lt. Governor had no respect for democracy and was unfit to hold any constitutional position.

Local unit secretary of CPI, A.M. Saleem, CPI leaders R. Viswanathan and Nara Kalainathan were among those who participated.
