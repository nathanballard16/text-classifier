UN report on Kashmir ‘false’

India while strongly reacting to a new report by the UN Office of the High Commission for Human Rights on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir has lodged a diplomatic protest against the rights body.

The Indian government has called the report “false, with a motivated narrative”. The report called on India to “respect the right of self-determination of the people of Kashmir as protected under international law”.

The Ministry of External Affairs has accused the UN Commissioner of “legitimising terrorism” and said the assertions in the report are “in violation of India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and ignore the core issue of cross-border terrorism.” NDTV reported.

“It is a… contrived effort to create an artificial parity between the world’s largest and the most vibrant democracy and a country that openly practices state-sponsored terrorism,” the Ministry of External Affairs said.

The UN Commissioner’s stresses that “neither the Governments of India nor of Pakistan have taken clear steps to address and implement the recommendations” made in the UN Human Rights Office’s previous report, published in June 2018. It therefore restates those recommendations along with additional ones. It also calls on the 47-Member-State UN Human Rights Council to “consider… the possible establishment of a commission of inquiry to conduct a comprehensive independent international investigations into allegations of human rights violations in Kashmir.”

India said “the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. Pakistan is in illegal and forcible occupation of a part of the Indian state, including the so called ‘Azad Jammu and Kashmir’ and ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, through aggression. We have repeatedly called on Pakistan to vacate these occupied territories.”

“Motivated attempts to weaken our national resolve will never succeed,” it added.
