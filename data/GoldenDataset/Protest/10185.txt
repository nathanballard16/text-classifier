SFI, ABVP hold 'cut money' protests in Kolkata

Kolkata, July 2 : The Students' Federation of India (SFI) on Tuesday held demonstrations inside the Calcutta University campus, accusing the ruling Trinamool Congress' students union of taking 'cut money' for students' admission in various courses.

Members of the Left wing students' union rallied outside a number of departments situated in the university's College Street (main) campus and raised slogans demanding that the Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) immediately return the illegally collected money.

They also blocked the university gate for an hour and threatened to continue the agitation until the cut money was returned.

Members of the BJP backed students' union Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) also held a sit-in protest on College Street on Tuesday afternoon on the same issue.
