Maharashtra: Congress-NCP assails BJP's 'Congress Mukta' agenda

Congress and Nationalist Congress Party have assailed the ruling BJP for its Congress Mukta (Congress free) Mumbai and Maharashtra agenda for ensuing assembly election slated for October. Both the parties have termed it BJP's arrogance to stay in power.



Newly appointed state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, announced that Congress Mukta Maharashtra will be his priority and the leaders from opposition will be inducted into the party ahead of assembly election. The timing coincides with BJP's meeting to review assembly poll preparations in the presence of working president JP Nadda in the city.



The city BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha announced that his priority will be to win all 36 assembly seats in partnership with Shiv Sena and make city Congress Mukta.



NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said that voters will not tolerate BJP's arrogance. "It is BJP's attempt to confuse the people by making repeated statements on how Congress and NCP leaders are eager to join them. The party does not see migration of its leaders,'' he said.



Congress' deputy leader in state assembly Naseem Khan said the party under the leadership of Balasaheb Thorat will put up united front to take on BJP. "Congress will fight election on state specific issues such as farmers distress, government's failure to provide reservation to dhangar community,'' he added.
