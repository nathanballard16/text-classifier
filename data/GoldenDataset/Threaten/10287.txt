Kashmir Journalists Protest Against ToI's 'Defamatory' Repor...

(MENAFN- Kashmir Observer) SRINAGAR — Scores of Kashmiri journalists Saturday held a silent protest at the Kashmir Press Club premises against the baseless and misleading report published in Times of India (ToI) the other day.

Journalists from both national and regional media vociferously condemned the malicious report which was based entirely on fabrication and concoction on part of ToI reporter Salim Pandith

Journalists in unanimous voice said that Pandith has no right to defame credible institutions like the Kashmir Press Club, Kashmir Editors Guild and English daily Kashmir Reader.

Besides this, the protesting journalists also deplored the act of labelling Kashmiri journalists by Pandith who is unfortunately notorious for disseminating fake news to suit his personal agenda and to avenge his group's loss in the recently-held elections of KPC.

The journalists further said that Pandith has relied on unsubstantiated claims to malign and endanger the entire journalist fraternity of Kashmir.

Members from KPC, Kashmir Editors Guild, Kashmir Working Journalists Association, Kashmir Journalists Association, Kashmir Press and Photographers Association and several other organisations demanded strict action against Pandith.

The protestors also demanded that membership of Pandith at KPC should be cancelled without any delay.

Moreover, it was demanded that the TdoI must immediately remove the baseless report and immediately publish an unconditional apology for publishing Pandith's fantasies.

Protesters were holding placards which read: 'Shame on TOI, Salim Pandit is a disgrace to journalism, Down With Fake News, Don't Throttle Press in Kashmir and cancel Pandith's KPC membership' etc.
