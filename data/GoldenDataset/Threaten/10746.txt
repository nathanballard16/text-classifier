Bill to ensure Muslim women are treated as equals: Shayara Bano

NEW DELHI: Victims and organisations, which had moved the Supreme Court about three years ago against talaq-e-biddat, remained divided on Tuesday after Parliament approved The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019.Thirty-eight-year-old Shayara Bano (who had demanded that talaq-e-biddat pronounced by her husband be declared void), the original petitioner in the instant talaq case in the Supreme Court in 2016, said the bill passed by Parliament was a testament to her struggle against the practice. “It is a move towards ensuring that Muslim women are treated as equals in society and in the eyes of law. I hope the government and society would now help rehabilitate victims like me,” Bano told ET.Based on her petition and six others, the SC had declared the practice unconstitutional in 2017.Nida Khan, a resident of Bareily district in UP and a victim, said the passage of the bill was a victory for Muslim women. “We have been pitted against our own religion. At least the new law has legitimised our struggle,” said the 24-year-old law student who now runs an NGO in UP for the benefit of instant talaq victims and those affected by domestic violence. “The challenge now is to ensure that the law is not misused.”The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a Mumbai-based NGO that was one of the petitioners in SC, hailed the bill. “It has paved the way for reform in the Muslim Personal Law and given an equal status to Muslim women,” said Noorjehan Safia Niaz of BMMA.However, Bebaak Collective, another NGO that was part of Bano’s petition in SC, in a statement objected to criminalising the offence. Condemning the incidents of lynching and mob attacks against Muslim men, the statement said lack of “democratic debate” only revealed the hypocrisy of the government that was targeting a particular group by providing a provision within the law.Meanwhile, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said it would “challenge the law in court after it is cleared by the President.” A member said: “When the SC has already declared the practice unconstitutional, there is no need to criminalise it.”
