Sensex, Nifty Little Changed In Early Trade

Indian shares were fluctuating in a narrow on Thursday, tracking mixed cues from Asia and a decline in U.S. stock futures after Apple said it would miss its sales target for the last three months of 2018 because of weak demand for iPhones in China.

The benchmark BSE Sensex was up 31 points at 35,922 in early trade after falling around 1 percent the previous day on the back of weak global cues and disappointing sales data from automakers. The broader Nifty index was down 3 points at 10.789.

The rupee weakened by 11 paise after tumbling by 75 paise to close at 70.18 per dollar on Wednesday, logging its first loss in four sessions.

Eicher Motor, Tata Steel, IOC, BPCL and HPCL fell 2-3 percent in the Nifty pack, while Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance and Cipla rose around 1 percent.

Ashok Leyland was marginally higher after it acquired 27.25 percent additional stake in Ashley Aviation Ltd.

ONGC dropped 1.5 percent on reports that it is reconsidering government demand to list its overseas unit.

Vijaya Bank slumped 6.4 percent and Dena Bank plunged more than 18 percent while Bank of Baroda rallied 2.3 percent on merger news.

Reliance Industries was little changed. Its telecom arm Reliance Jio has added 1.05 crore subscribers in December versus addition of 1.3 crore subscribers in the previous month.
