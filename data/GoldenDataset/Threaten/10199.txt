World court’s stress on ‘effective’ review a departure from past

The ICJ may not have annulled the death sentence to Kulbhushan Jadhav , or acceded to India's demand for a fresh trial in a civil court, but in emphasising on an "effective" review and calling even for, if necessary, enacting appropriate legislation to facilitate it, the Court seems to have gone a step further than its judgment in the LaGrand and Avena cases where too it had held the receiving State, the US, guilty of violating the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.This should help India build up its case for immediate access to Jadhav and ensure that he is provided all consular and legal assistance.While the relief given by the ICJ is review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s conviction and sentence, in contrast to past cases of this kind, as Geneva-based international lawyer Shashank P Kumar says, the Court placed a special emphasis on ensuring the “effectiveness” of such review and reconsideration and provided considerable guidance to Pakistan."The Court considered it unclear whether judicial review over Pakistan military courts can be exercised for violations of the Vienna Convention. The Court also appeared to impliedly suggest that Pakistan’s military courts can violate fundamental rights under Pakistan’s constitution," says Kumar, also first Indian law-clerk at the ICJ.According to Kumar, it’s also significant that the Court also put on record Pakistan’s declarations about guarantees of a fair trial under its domestic law. "In light of all these points, the Court went so far as to suggest that, if necessary, Pakistan may need to enact legislation to ensure that the review and reconsideration is effective," he says.While the Court left the choice of means for review and reconsideration to Pakistan, it also said that freedom in the choice of means was not without qualification. The obligation to provide effective review and reconsideration is an obligation of result which must be performed unconditionally, said the Court. The ICJ said that Pakistan’s decision to not inform Jadhav of his rights and deny India access to him constituted "internationally wrongful acts of a continuing character."While in the Avena case, Mexico had accused the US of denying consular access to 51 Mexican nationals who were convicted and sentenced to death, the LaGrand case involved 2 German brothers who too were denied consular access before they were convicted and sentenced to death by a US court.In the Jadhav case though, the ICJ was faced with an unprecedented situation in the sense that the conviction was by a military court.While India had expressed apprehension about the conduct of Pakistan military courts, the ICJ in its judgment put on record the assurance from Pakistan counsel that the high courts of Pakistan exercised “effective review jurisdiction”, giving as an example the decision of the Peshawar High Court in 2018 in which it had held that it had the legal mandate positively to interfere with decisions of military courts.
