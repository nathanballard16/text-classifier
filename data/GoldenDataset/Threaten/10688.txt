Protest at Punbus: Govt cancels recruitment on outsourcing basis

Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, July 29Taking cognizance of the intensified protests of the Punbus Contractual Workers Union, the officials of the Transport Ministry finally stepped down from their decision of recruiting workers on outsourcing basis. However, the ultimatum of state-level ‘Chakka Jam’ strike by the union forced the officials to cancel the recruitment, until further orders. The district president of the union Salwinder Singh alleged that instead of regularising the contractual workers, the contractors were removing them from their jobs and hiring new staff on outsource basis. “Meanwhile, all 20,000 contractual workers will continue to hold strike on August 2 at Jalandhar, Ludhaiana, Amritsar, Rajpura and Kharar. Further, they would also observe the Independence Day as ‘Gulami Diwas’,” said Salwinder Singh.
