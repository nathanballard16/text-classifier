Don’t politicise Narmada dam issue: Vijay Rupani warns MP

RAJKOT: Chief minister Vijay Rupani has warned the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh not to politicise the Narmada dam issue . He has asked the MP government not to vitiate the peaceful and cooperative environment between four beneficiary states over distribution of Narmada water that has been maintained for the past four decades.Rupani was reacting to MP Narmada Valley Development minister Surendra Singh Baghel’s threat of not releasing Narmada water for the Sardar Sarovar dam unless the Gujarat government and the Centre addressed their concerns about the dam-affected people.The MP government had also objected to a decision of the Narmada Control Authority (NCA) to halt production of electricity at the River Bed Power House of the Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP-RBPH). The NCA had consented to Gujarat’s request in April this year to halt power generation at the SSP-RBPH so that the reservoir could be filled to capacity this monsoon.Baghel, on Saturday, alleged that the Gujarat government was not holding the meetings of the NCA ‘seriously’ for finding agreement on rehabilitation of the project-affected people. Nor was Gujarat releasing water for power generation (a large chunk of power goes to MP), he alleged.Terming the statement as political, the CM said it was far from the truth. “Gujarat has never interfered with electricity generation for Madhya Pradesh. About 57% of the power generated at Sardar Sarovar dam is given to MP,” Rupani said.He further said that the states are bound by the Supreme Court judgment and water distribution decision by the NCA. Referring to the displaced people, Rupani said they have been rehabilitated from 2017 to date as per apex court’s order.“Gujarat didn’t take any decision on it’s own but as per a proper proposal sent to NCA in April. During the joint meeting of all the four states, including Maharashtra and Rajasthan, decision was taken to halt power generation,” the CM said.Rupani contended that Madhya Pradesh government has raised the issue of displaced people suddenly with Gujarat chief secretary in a letter dated May 27, saying that 6,000 dam-affected families were yet to be relocated. A meeting of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation sub-group of the NCA was held on the issue on July 12, but no senior official of the MP government participated, Rupani alleged.“They also boycotted a meeting of the Sardar Sarovar Reservoir Regulation Committee on July 18,” he added.
