Karnataka political crisis: Trust vote today

BENGALURU: After missing two deadlines, the Congress-JD(S) government is scheduled to face the crucial floor test in the assembly today.

Here's a look at what can happen today.If the current impasse continues with respect to the 15 who have resigned and the two independents, who have pledged support to the BJP, chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will lose the trust vote . Alternatively, with defeat imminent, he could resign without taking the vote, paving the way for the BJP to form the government.Governor Vajubhai Vala may set another deadline for Kumaraswamy to prove his majority.K Sudhakar, MTB Nagaraj, ST Somashekhar, Basavaraj Byrathi, Munirathna, BC Patil, Pratapagouda Patil Maski, Mahesh Kumatalli, Ramesh Jarkiholi and Shivaram Hebbar (all Cong) K Gopalaiah, H Vishwanath and KC Narayanagowda (all JD-S).Anand Singh and Roshan Baig.H Nagesh and R Shankar.Shrimanth Patil and B Nagendra (both Congress MLAs).
