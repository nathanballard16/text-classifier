LAHORE: Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik’s wife Mushaal Hussein Mullick has said the United Nation Security Council’s (UNSC) Friday consultative meeting to discuss India’s illegal move of stripping Occupied Kashmir (IOK) of its special status is no less than a miracle.



“India’s cruel face has been exposed all over the world. India wants to convert Kashmir into a graveyard of Kashmiris. The fate of Kashmir should be decided according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Mullick told a press conference on Friday.



She said the media had conveyed their voice to the international community but the voice of the Kashmiri Hurriyat leaders is being suppressed. “There is a media blackout in Kashmir and journalists are being arrested,” she added.



Mullick said India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had taken Kashmir to the UN and this time the issue has once again been taken to the UN with the help of Pakistan and China.



“Ethnic cleansing of Kashmiris is under way. However, India is being condemned all over the world. There is no issue greater than the Kashmir. The plan of Hindi extremists to create a Greater India, Akhand Bharat, in the region will be devastating,” she said.



She said the world cannot afford a nuclear war, hoping that the UNSC will open up new ways to resolve the longstanding dispute. “Kashmir does not have any army but Allah and Pakistan are helping it.”



Mullick said Kashmiris under siege need medicines and food. In the last five years, India occupation forces have intensified encounters targeting the Muslim community.



“Pakistan must raise the Kashmir issue with international human rights organisations. There is a need to call for implementation of the UN's resolution immediately instead of making statements,” she added.
