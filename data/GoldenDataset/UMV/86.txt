Arun Jaitley: Irresponsible document, will never be implemented: Arun Jaitley on Congress manifesto

NEW DELHI: BJP questioned several promises made in the Congress manifesto , with finance minister Arun Jaitley alleging it was a “charter to weaken India” as it sought to “dilute” Afspa, the fight against terrorism and Maoism , and was “bluffing” the people on Nyay, farm loan waivers and women’s reservation in legislatures.BJP tried to revert the political debate to nationalism and security even as the Congress underlined its commitment to creating jobs, welfare of the poor and weaker sections and improving the state of the economy. Jaitley contended if one went through details of the Congress manifesto, one would find lacunae and difficulties in implementing the ideas.“Congress seeks to dilute provisions of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. After having been spurned on various occasions to have a dialogue with separatists, who want to settle for nothing other than cessation from India, it promised to have a continuous dialogue with them. It promises to dilute the presence of the armed forces in Kashmir,” Jaitley alleged. Congress is the “creator” of the Kashmir problem and brought Article 35A “unconstitutionally”, he alleged. “A reference to Kashmiri Pandits and their ethnic cleansing from the Valley is conspicuously absent in the manifesto,” Jaitley said.“There is only lip sympathy in the assault required on Maoist violence… Congress and Congressmen have always flirted with Maoists as fellow travellers,” the minister said.BJP also sought to know how Congress plans to fund Nyay.“The Congress manifesto compromises national security and has a sham and bluff promises with little detailed understanding of the subjects involved. It is irresponsible document which will never be implemented since Congress looks a certain loser,” Jaitley said.
