New Delhi: Amid attempts to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Times Now has accessed never-before-seen evidence of ethnic cleansing of Hindus in the Kashmir Valley. A satellite image, dating back to 2001 of North Handwara in Kashmir, shows systematic razing of all Kashmiri Hindu dwellings.

A second satellite image, which dates back to 2017 of the same area in Handwara, shows encroachment of Hindu lands by locals. The satellite images totally expose the lies uttered by the Kashmiri politicians, who claim that they are ready to welcome the Kashmiri Hindus back to their homes.

However, Times Now’s exclusive investigation proves that there are no homes for Hindus to return to in Kashmir.

PM Narendra Modi had yesterday declared in Houston (Texas, US) the strong support that Article 370's abrogation enjoys among mainstream India while effectively hitting out at Pakistan over its obsessive focus on Kashmir.

"The work done by India is bothering some people who are not able to handle their own country. They do not want peace," said PM Modi in a veiled attack on Pakistan.

Notably ahead of the 'Howdy, Modi!' event, the Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora (GKPD) expressed its support for the Indian government's move as regards Article 370 abrogation.

The organisation said it will "unequivocally support Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India to raise awareness that the cessation of Article 370 will enhance human rights greatly in Kashmir".

In the early 90s, the Kashmiri Pandit community was forced to leave the Valley as militancy peaked in the area.
