Pakistan rejects India’s abolishment of Article 370

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday strongly condemned and rejected the Indian government’s announcement regarding occupied Kashmir.



The Indian government rushed through a presidential decree to abolish special status granted to occupied Kashmir under the constitution.

In a press released the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Indian occupied Kashmir was an internationally recognised disputed territory.

“No unilateral step by the Government of India can change this disputed status, as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Nor will this ever be acceptable to the people of Jammu & Kashmir and Pakistan,” said the press release.

“As the party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps,” it added.

The Foreign Office stressed that Pakistan stood firm in its commitment to the Kashmir cause and its political, diplomatic and moral support to the people of occupied Kashmir for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.

'Threat of genocide'

Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood said there was a threat of genocide and ethnic cleansing in occupied Kashmir after India revoked Article 370.

Qureshi said Pakistan would request and appeal to the United Nations, OIC, friendly countries and human rights organisations not to remain silent on this issue.

According to Qureshi, the situation in occupied Kashmir was more serious than before. “We will consult our legal experts and I believe the freedom movement in Kashmir will gain momentum,” he added.
