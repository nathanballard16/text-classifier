Kashmir must prosper

Kashmiri Pandits, the indigenous people of the Kashmirvalley, are the primary stakeholders to the land of Kashmir. They have been thefirst victims of violence in the valley. Their resettlement in Kashmir Valleyis the party's basic commitment. BJP is conscious of the geopoliticalaspirations of Pandits in this regard. We will ensure that the displacedcommunity gets its due and a process will be initiated once terrorism isfinished and peace restored. It is also a fact that the minority community inKashmir, currently living as the displaced entity, has been asking for the establishmentof Special Crimes Tribunal to investigate the crimes against humanity in regardto the Pandits. The basis of such Tribunal should be the decision of theNational Human Rights Commission (India) in which it said that "acts akin to genocide have been committed against theKashmiri Pandit community in Kashmir".
