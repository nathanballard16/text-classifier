Islamabad, Aug 15: Pakistan Prime Minister once again questioned the international community's silence on Kashmir and warned of severe repercussions in the Muslim world, if ethnic cleansing of Muslims take place in the valley.

In a warning to India, Imran Khan said that if the alleged "ethnic cleansing" in Kashmir continued, "it will have severe repercussions and reactions in the Muslim world setting off radicalisation and cycles of violence."

Khan further said that what was happening in Kashmir was an "example of Modi's earlier ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Gujarat."
