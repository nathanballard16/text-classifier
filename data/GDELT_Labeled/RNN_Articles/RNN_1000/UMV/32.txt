India sponsored Peshawar school massacre: Pakistan's allegation in Kulbhushan Jadhav hearing at ICJ

Pakistan has accused India of sponsoring the 2014 Peshawar school massacre in which 140 children were gunned down by terrorists of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. This accusation was levelled as part of the arguments submitted by Pakistan at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as part of the hearings into India's plea for the release of former Indian Navy officer Kulbhshan Jadhav from a Pakistani prison where he is on death row.

Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is an operative for RAW, India's external intelligence agency, and accuses him of planning and carrying out terror attacks in Pakistan. India however has said Jadhav was abducted from Iran and being scapegoated by Pakistan.

Pakistan's Attorney General Anwar Mansoor Khan, submitting his arguments at the ICJ¸ said, "The Indian petition in the ICJ is a clear example of traditional methods to downplay Pakistan… India has always violated the resolutions of the Geneva Convention. In 2014, we lost 140 children in the attack on the Army Public School (in Peshawar), which was admittedly sponsored by India through Afghanistan."

He further claimed that Jadhav had carried out bombings and targeted operations aimed at promoting anarchy in Pakistan, and targeting Balochistan and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Pakistan's counsel Khawar Qureshi claimed in his arguments that Jadhav had confessed to all accusations in front of a Pakistani judicial magistrate, and said India had smoothed over this.

However, India's counsel Harish Salve had poked holes in the lack of transparency or due process in the way Jadhav was put on trial and then sentenced to death by a military court. Salve had pointed out that none of those who adjudicated on the issue as part of the military court held a law degree and painted it as a politically motivated ruling.
