Brig. (retired) Naeem Khalid Lodhi has urged international community to play its role for provision of basic human rights to minorities

Brig. Retd. Naeem Khalid Lodhi (Defense Analyst): India is no more a secular state. The Modi regime is dominated by Hindu extremist groups and Modi himself is accused of Gujrat massacre, which resulted in killing of Muslims. There are many separatist movements in India demanding separation. India has been violating human rights not only in Kashmir but with in India itself. Muslims are the biggest minority in India followed by Christians, Sikhs and Dalits. Narendra Modi, is a staunch advocate of the establishment of Hindutva as the dominant ideology in secular India. Itâ€™s high time that the international community and organizations take effective measures to ensure availability of basic human rights to minorities of India.
