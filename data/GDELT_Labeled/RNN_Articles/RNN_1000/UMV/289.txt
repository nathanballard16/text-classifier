ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said the ethnic cleansing of occupied Kashmir was happening through a Nazi-inspired Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideology.

The prime minister in a post on Twitter said, “The curfew, crackdown and impending genocide of Kashmiris in IoK is unfolding exactly according to RSS ideology inspired by Nazi ideology. Attempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. Question is: Will the world watch and appease as they did Hitler at Munich?”

“I am afraid this RSS ideology of Hindu Supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan Supremacy, will not stop in IoK; instead it will lead to suppression of Muslims in India and eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan. The Hindu Supremacists version of Hitler's Lebensraum,” PM Imran added.

India’s decision to revoke the valley's special status of the occupied valley has been slammed western media and heavily criticised.



Amnesty International has termed India's move to revoke Article 370 in occupied Kashmir as a "unilateral decision" and said it was "likely to increase the risk of further human rights violations and inflame tensions".

Communications ban continued in the occupied valley entered the seventh day with over 800 political leaders and workers detained since India revoked the valley's special status on Monday.



Workers have been lodged in makeshift detention centres in Srinagar, Baramulla, Gurez and other areas, as jails and police stations of the valley were overcrowded with hundreds of Hurriyat leaders and activists in them.
