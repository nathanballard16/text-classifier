The Bill which was tabled for discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday by Union Home Minister Amit Shah was passed late on Monday night.

While the opposition parties questioned the nature of the CAB describing it "against Muslim community", the Centre rejected the claim saying it does not affect the community residing in the country.

The Bill will be debated upon in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the Congress has urged its party leaders and workers to hold protests across the country on Wednesday over the Bill.

"You are aware that our party is opposing the CAB which is likely to be taken up in Rajya Sabha tomorrow (Wednesday). We need to enlighten the public at large on our stand and mobilize support in favour of our decision," wrote Congress General Secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal in a letter to all the state party chiefs.

I request you to undertake dharna pradarshan (protest) tomorrow (Wednesday) against the Bill in state headquarters by involving the senior leaders and frontal organisations, he said.

All the major opposition parties, including the Congress, the TMC, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhgam (DMK), All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), AIUDF, BSP, Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party and YSR Congress have opposed the Bill by referring to various articles of the Constitution.
