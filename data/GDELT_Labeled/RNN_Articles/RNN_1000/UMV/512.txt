RADIO PAKISTAN

India cannot suppress Indigenous freedom movement of Kashmiris through use of brute force:

Raja Najabat Hussain (Hurriyet Leader): Radio Pakistan provides an opportunity to raise the voice of Kashmiri brethren. The people of Kashmir are thankful to Pakistan government for doing great efforts to highlight Kashmir issue at every international forum. Kashmri and Pakistani Diaspora is proactively sensitizing the world regarding Kashmir issue. Government of India is committing ethnic cleansing in Indian occupied Kashmir. Pakistan has emerged as an ambassador of the people of Kashmir. We are also thankful to the leadership of Turkey, China and Malaysia raising Kashmir issue and supporting Kashmir cause at international front. India is following the footsteps of Israel who always ignored UN resolutions and international laws. India should realize that Indigenous freedom movement cannot be suppressed with power. Any unilateral decision regarding a disputed territory is unacceptable and issue of Kashmir can only be resolved in accordance with the United Nations resolutions.
