PM questions world’s silence on rights abuse in held Kashmir

KARACHI: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday again invited the international community’s attention to the plight of people of India-held Kashmir.

In a series of tweets, the Pakistani leader lamented the deteriorating human rights situation in the valley.

“Today is the 32nd day of siege of IOJK by the Indian Occupation Forces of the Modi Govt. Under cover of this siege, Indian forces have killed, injured (with pellet guns), abused Kashmiri men, women & children. Men have been taken away & thrown into prisons across India,” read one post.

The premier continues, “Hospitals have run out of medical supplies; basic necessities are in short supply but a communication blackout has deprived Kashmiris a voice to the outside world & their families. Despite this, tales of horror are finding their way into the international media”.

In another message on the microblogging website, Mr Khan said: “The world cannot feign ignorance as it did at Munich in 1938. The fascist, Hindu-Supremacist design of the Modi Govt with its ethnic cleansing & genocide of Muslims’ agenda in IOJK, in India itself (Assam) & beyond into AJK is now overt for all the world to see.”

“India’s violation of all international laws including humanitarian laws is there for the world to see. So why is the world silent? Is the international community’s humanity dead when Muslims are being persecuted? What message is being sent to the 1.3 bn Muslims across the world?” he asked in yet another tweet.
