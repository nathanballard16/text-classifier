SHO arrested for taking Rs 8 lakh bribe was former top cop’s PR man

SHO sent to 14-day jail, cops may search his house

NOIDA: Inspector Manoj Pant , who was caught red-handed inside Sector 20 police station on Wednesday accepting Rs 8 lakh bribe from a call centre owner after striking a deal to remove the latter’s name from an FIR, has had a chequered career with Uttar Pradesh Police.A 2000-batch Uttar Pradesh Police Services officer, Pant has seen both highs and lows in the 18 years he has been a cop. Till only a year ago, he was former Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Ajaypal Sharma’s public relations officer.Perceived to be close to Sharma, Pant was made in-charge of the high-profile Sector 20 police station just six months ago at a time when the then SSP was going hammer and tongs at fake call centres in Gautam Budh Nagar, thanks to tip-offs from the FBI and Canadian law-enforcement agencies.Under Sharma’s leadership, Pant busted as many as 20 fake call centres and also the biggest weed supply racket in Sector 9 area in the past few months.But Pant is no stranger to controversy. He first hogged media limelight as a police post in-charge in Kanpur some 15 years ago, when he was suspended for assaulting a couple of journalists. And when he was made an inspector and posted as the SHO of Gomti Nagar police station in Lucknow, he was accused of sexual harassment by a woman.Later when he was transferred to Kaisarbagh police station as the SHO, he was in the news again.Sources said he had then arrested a man for allegedly possessing uranium, but the case was later found to be fake and an FIR was registered against him and the accused was released.Pant, sources said, was also embroiled in a controversy when fresh allegati-ons surfaced that he had illegally acquired the property of someone.“However, when he was brought to Noida by then SSP Sharma in 2018 as his PRO, Pant came so close to mediapersons in the district that he was soon given the charge of Surajpur police station. Within six months, he was transferred to the city area as the SHO of Sector 20 police station, which is till date the largest police station of Noida,” sources said.During his arrest in the early hours of Wednesday, Pant had allegedly assaulted an IPS officer when he was getting his fingerprints.But when asked if he would face charges, Rajeev Singh, investigating officer in the case, and circle officer 2, said “the IPS officer who had filed the complaint of corruption against the SHO had not mentioned anything about the assault”.Greater Noida: An anti-corruption court in Meerut has sent SHO Manoj Pant and three local reporters, arrested for taking Rs 8 lakh to alter an FIR against a call centre owner, to 14-day judicial custody. Police said they have suspended the SHO and also applied for a warrant to search his house.While SHO Pant was caught red-handed inside the Sector 20 police station by a team led by SSP Vaibhav Krishna in the early hours of Wednesday while accepting the money from a call centre owner in exchange for removing the latter’s name from an FIR, the reporters were nabbed for facilitating the deal.Rajeev Singh, circle officer 2, Noida, said the four accused were booked under sections 7, 8 and 13 (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Section 384 (extortion) of IPC and Section 30 of the Arms Act. “The accused were produced in the court on Wednesday evening, which sent them to judicial custody for 14 days. They are currently lodged in Meerut jail. Meanwhile, we are in the final stages of collecting evidence and sending the same to the forensic labs in Agra and Lucknow,” he said.“We have also sought a warrant to search the house of the SHO Pant as part of the inve-stigation. He has also been suspended till the inquiry is on,” said Sudha Singh, SP (city), Noida. Police also said they have not yet found any document for the Mercedes car and and the gun that were recovered from the reporters.
