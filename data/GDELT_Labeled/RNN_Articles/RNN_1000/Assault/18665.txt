Plea date set for Sydney Mines man charged with assaulting Sydney cab driver

SYDNEY, N.S. — A plea date has been set for a 21-year-old Sydney Mines man charged with assaulting a Sydney cab driver.

Kenneth Gregory LeBlanc of O’Toole’s Lane is charged with assault and mischief relating to a damaged two-way radio.

The offences are alleged to have occurred Sept. 29 in Sydney.

The charges were filed after cab driver A.K. Brar, a 24-year-old international student from India, reported being assaulted after he and a passenger got into an argument outside the Needs Convenience store on Victoria Road in Sydney.

Speaking during an interview with the Post shortly after the attack, Brar, who attends Cape Breton University, said his passenger was highly agitated when he asked for his fare in advance, a company policy for fares outside the confines of the boundary of the former city of Sydney.

Brar suffered minor injuries.

LeBLanc is now scheduled to enter pleas Dec. 18.
