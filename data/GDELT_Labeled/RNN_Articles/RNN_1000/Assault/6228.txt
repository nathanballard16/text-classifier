Indian bishop charged with raping nun

New Delhi: A Roman Catholic bishop has been charged by Indian police with repeatedly raping a nun in her rural convent.

Bishop Franco Mulakkal was charged with rape, illegal confinement and intimidation, said Hari Sankar, a district police chief in the southern state of Kerala, India's Catholic heartland, on Wednesday.

The nun who made the accusations, who has not been publicly identified, said she went to police last year only after complaining repeatedly to church authorities.

Eventually, a group of fellow nuns launched unprecedented public protests to demand Mulakkal's arrest. He was arrested but released after a few weeks.
