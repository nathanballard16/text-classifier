IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman returns to India

Attari (Punjab): The Indian Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was in Pakistan captivity has been released. There was a six hours of confusion over his handing over. According to sources, Pakistan changed the timing of handover twice.

Pakistani officials handed over Varthaman to Indian officials, including from the IAF, at the Attari-Wagah Border and was received by Border Security Force. He was accompanied by IAF Group Captain Joy Thomas Kurien, Defence Attache to Indian High Commission in Pakistan.

Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor, addressing the media at Attari-Wagah border, said "Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman has been handed over to us. He will now be taken for a detailed medical checkup because he had to eject from an aircraft. IAF is happy to have him back".

However, the pilot was whisked away in a convoy by Indian officials away from the public glare.

Abhinandan Varthaman was captured on Wednesday by Pakistan after his MiG-21 Bison fighter jet was hit by Pakistan Air Force jets near the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced on Thursday that the captured IAF pilot will be freed as a "goodwill gesture" after New Delhi sought his unconditional, immediate and unharmed release.

Beating retreat and flag-lowering ceremony at Attari-Wagah border have been cancelled for today. The Border Security Force (BSF), which mans the JCP and the 553-km long International Border with Pakistan in Punjab is at high alert, Punjab Police and other security agencies stationed additional personnel since early Friday morning.

Varthaman will be debriefed by defence and security officials before being flown to New Delhi from Amritsar. According to IAF officials, he will be brought to Delhi from Amritsar in a special flight.
