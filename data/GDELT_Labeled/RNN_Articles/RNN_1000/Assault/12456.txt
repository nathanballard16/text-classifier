DCW issues notice to Delhi Police over stabbing of woman in Bhogal

The DCW has issued a notice to the Delhi Police seeking details of a case in which a woman was stabbed to death by a man in full public glare in Bhogal.

Based on media reports in the case, the panel issued the notice to the deputy commissioner of police, southeast Delhi.

The incident took place on Friday evening near Bhogal bus stand.

The accused had an argument with the woman, following which he stabbed her multiple times, police had said.

The woman died while she was being taken to the hospital in an auto-rickshaw, while the accused was caught by the bystanders and handed over to police, they added.

"This is a shocking incident where a young life was lost due to complete lack of fear of law. It is critical that all forms of harassment especially stalking are reported and acted upon urgently," the Delhi Commission for Women said in its notice.

The panel has sought a detailed status report in the matter by August 1. It has asked for a copy of the FIR, details of PCR calls made in the case and time taken by police to reach the spot.

The DCW has also asked whether any complaint was lodged by the victim or her family in the past (including those made on 100) against the accused.
