In her complaint to the police, the model/actor has claimed that she got acquainted with the doctor in 2017 when she was referred to him by a friend with respect to skin treatment. The two became friends but the complainant has alleged that she was raped and blackmailed by the doctor who clicked illicit pictures of her on at least one occasion in order to use them to blackmail her. The latest reports assert that the doctor has been interrogated by Mumbai police who are currently seeking technical evidence to build a "watertight case" against him.

An official investigating the matter told media outlets that a complaint was received by Versova police, in this regard, last week. We made the arrest on Sunday based on her complaint and the matter is still under active investigation, added the officer. In fact, a report by Hindustan Times quotes an official probing the matter claiming that the doctor even rented a house in Versova for the woman and account details have revealed that transactions were made from his account to hers.

Earlier this month, Uppal police in Hyderabad arrested a doctor practicing in Chilukanagar basti for attempting to rape a female patient when she visited him for the treatment of her headache. In her complaint, the woman had alleged that the accused doctor took her into a room where he tried to take advantage of her. Balaraju, the accused, was arrested on the basis of her complaint on May 4. This shocking case had emerged from Hyderabad, less than two days after a homeopathy doctor was arrested for molesting a patient at Chilkalguda.
