India Adopts Mechanisms to Track Pakistani Drones Allegedly Used to Make Cross-Border Weapons Drops

On each sortie, the drones dropped packages weighing up to 10 kg and reportedly containing arms, explosives and communication equipment such as cellular and satellite phones.

The BSF has explicitly been working on "detection, identification and interdiction" of drones used from across the border to drop weapons reportedly meant for assisting terrorist activities in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, the reports said citing sources.

The Pakistan Foreign Office and Pakistan's media wing the ISPR, both refused to comment on New Delhi's latest use of anti-drone mechanisms on the western border separating the two nations.

An official, privy to the development, but speaking on condition of anonymity, was quoted as saying: "The BSF, in its initial move, first of all, is trying to figure out the real threat from drones."

He further said the task before the BSF is a challenging one, and a team has been deployed to get information about the drones found by police in Punjab state which borders with Pakistan.
