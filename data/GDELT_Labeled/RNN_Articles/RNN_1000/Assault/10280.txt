Ahmedabad: 26-yr-old woman accuses lover of rape on pretext of marriage

A case was lodged with the Vastrapur police station on Tuesday by a 26-year-old woman alleging that a man had tricked her into having sexual relations with him, after promising to marry her.



The woman is a resident of Delhi and as per the complaint, in June 2018, she came into contact with the accused identified as Keshav Gohil, a resident of Mumbai on Facebook. Soon after, they started dating.

On November 10, the couple planned to meet each other in Ahmedabad, as Gohil was going to visit Jamnagar for some training. As per the plan, the two reached Ahmedabad, booked a room at the Vibrant hotel located in Thaltej area and stayed there for four days.

As per the woman's allegation, during the four days, the couple had sex after the accused promised to marry her. After that, the couple went back to their respective cities.

Later the victim found out that she was pregnant and informed Gohil about this. He contacted one of his friends in Gandhinagar, who sent some medicine to the woman to abort the pregnancy, which she took.

Once this was done, the woman tried getting in touch with Gohil but he blocked her on social media and didn't take her calls either. After being ignored by her lover, the woman went into depression and felt used by the accused just for sexual favours.

Inspector MM Jadeja of Vastrapur police station said, "We have lodged a complaint in the matter with the police station after the victim came from Delhi and further investigation is on. Right now, we don't know what the accused actually does; as per the woman, he had come for some Indian Navy training in Jamnagar, but we are not sure about that right now. The investigation will lead us to the truth."
