Will be made compliant with norms of European anti-torture watchdog.Theis readying itself for high-profile fugitive offenders. The state prisons department is making it the first in the country to comply with the guidelines of a European antitorture watchdog—considered a benchmark in the humane treatment of prisoners—to ensure that extraditions are processed quickly.A separate barrack will be earmarked for, which can lodge at least 25 inmates.Fugitive economic offenders like Vijay Mallya andhave fought India’s extradition appeal with the claims that prison conditions in the country are appalling and deplorable, and operate in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment.The prisons department sent a letter to the state government in the first week of September, stating that to approve extradition requests, foreign courts and governments often insist on an undertaking from the Indian government that the offender will be lodged in a prison that meets the standards prescribed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT). In some cases, an independent agency is sent to cross-verify assurances made by the Centre when seeking extradition.The CPT is a specialised monitoring body of the 47-member Council of Europe, comprising independent and impartial experts such as lawyers, medical doctors and specialists in prison or police matters. It is not part of the European Union, but the latter often refers to the CPT’s observations and recommendations when drafting legal texts as well as during communication with member and non-member states.The letter referred particularly to India’s protracted extradition appeal for Mallya and Modi, who are currently in the UK, “despite overwhelming evidence against them”. “Mehul Choksi, residing in Antigua and Barbuda, is another accused whose extradition is being sought by the Central Bureau of Investigation,” it stated.As the first step towards compliance with the CTP’s standards, a team from the prisons department may soon visit the UK to learn about prison conditions there. The state government has been requested to clear this visit at the earliest.In Maharashtra, only barrack 12 in the crowdedcurrently has the facilities to lodge VIP inmates, but it can’t take in any more offenders. “It has tighter security—an officer and a guard are on duty round the clock— and its two cells are monitored 24x7 from a control room. Each cell can lodge three persons, but one cell is already occupied,” said a prison official. The prison is also bursting at the seams: it has 3,368 inmates against a capacity of 804. The 2,124-capacity Taloja jail is not as crowded—as of July, it had 2,227 inmates.In September last year, London’s Westminster court, which is reviewing Mallya’s petition against his extradition, had asked for a “step by step video” showing conditions at Arthur Road jail’s barrack 12. After India submitted the video, the court expressed satisfaction with the evidence and said that there were no grounds to believe that he faces any risk at all in the jail.
