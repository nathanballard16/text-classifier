Demonetisation biggest attack on black money: BJP

NEW DELHI: Terming demonetisation as the “biggest assault” on black money, BJP on Friday said the opposition’s charges was out of sheer frustration as they had built a corrupt eco-system after ruling the country for decades.“Demonetisation was the biggest singular act ever undertaken by any government to launch a frontal assault on black money and parallel economy. The move greatly contributed towards elimination of a super structure of black eco- system built over decades of faulty economic policies by successive Congress governments,” BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao told TOI.He said demonetisation contributed to formalising the economy and gave a huge boost to digital transactions.
