Two set laundryman on fire in Madhopuri

Ludhiana: Two goons threw petrol on a laundryman and set him on fire in Madhopuri Friday morning.

Davinder Lal, 45, was ironing clothes at his shop when the two approached him around 7.30am. “They were carrying a bottle. Claiming it to be liquor, the duo offered it to Davinder. When he refused, they threw the bottle contents on him, set him on fire and fled from the spot. The bottle contained petrol,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP central) Waryam Singh.

On hearing Davinder’s screams, neighbours rushed to his rescue.

Naresh Gogna, an eyewitness, said, “I was standing outside my house when I heard Davinder screaming. I ran towards him and saw two men running from there. Flames had engulfed Davinder’s face. I doused the fire with my shirt. We then rushed Davinder to civil hospital.”

Davinder, who received burns on his face, told the police, “After the two threw petrol on my face, I tried to wipe it off with a cloth I was holding. But within no time, they lighted a matchstick and threw it at me.”

The area residents have identified the accused. “The residents said the two often visited their area and were seen working with a woman, who is a sanitation worker. We have traced the woman. The accused will be arrested soon,” the ACP added.

Police suspect old rivalry sparked the incident.

“It seems to be a fallout of an old enmity. Davinder is yet to divulge it. A CCTV camera installed in the locality has captured the accused. The shop where Davinder was working is his brother’s. Two months ago, his brother Raju went to their native place in Uttar Pradesh and sent Davinder to Ludhiana to look after his work,” the ACP said.

The doctors attending on Davinder said he had suffered burns only on his face and was out of danger.
