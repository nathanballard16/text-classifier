L’Oreal beats Godrej Consumer in urban hair colour race

MUMBAI: L’Oréal SA has emerged as the largest hair colour marketer in urban India in value ahead ofProducts, riding on mass brand Garnier Black Naturals , which is now the French personal care firm’s highest selling hair colour brand globally. L’Oreal had 25.8% market share in the urban hair colour market in value terms last calendar year against Godrej’s 24%, industry officials said, quoting data from market tracker Nielsen . In 2017, Godrej had 26.3% share against L'Oreal's 25.3%, they said. Godrej remains the market leader across India and controls the bulk of the mass-end market.“We have an advantage in terms of value of L’Oréal Paris and also the whole salon channel, but Godrej has done a brilliant job of creating that category,” said Amit Jain, managing director at L’Oréal India.Jain, who joined L’Oréal last year and is the first Indian to occupy the position since the company entered the country in 1991, said the Indian unit is now a major contributor to its global business. “India is becoming a hub for reverse innovation into our other high-growth markets on a formulation and developmental aspect,” he said.L’Oréal, which controls more than 70% of the urban salon market in India, launched indigenous hair colour product five years ago, with a price tag of less than two-thirds of the next cheapest brand in its portfolio. The company's portfolio, however, is still skewed towards premium brands in a hope to capture the growing ranks of middle-class customers by luring them upscale with aspirational products.The Indian hair care industry has evolved to a $3.3-billion, or about ?23,600-crore, market, with growth rate of about 10%, according to a recent report by Nielsen.New-age segments are growing faster. For example, colorants, which account for 18% of the overall hair category, have been growing 15% a year, it said.While Godrej mostly controls the mass-end market, it has been upgrading its portfolio over the past few years. It was the first to launch a hair-colour crème in a sachet at a market disruptive price, forcing competitors to try and play catchup with me-too offerings.“Godrej Expert Rich Crème continues to consistently deliver robust growth and has achieved the highest ever market share on an exit basis in the third quarter of FY19,” Vivek Gambhir, MD at Godrej Consumer Products, said without commenting on its market share.
