Issewal gangrape: 6th accused not to be tried as juvenile

A local court on Wednesday dismissed the revision petition filed by one of the accused in the Issewal gang rape case where he had prayed that he should be considered as a juvenile and tried by the Juvenile Justice Board.

Copy of the detailed order was yet not available.

Drawing a parallel with the juvenileâ€™s trial in the infamous Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, the counsel for one of the accused in the Issewal gang rape case had claimed that the accused was minor on the day of the offence and had sought trial before a Juvenile Justice Board. In the review petition filed before the trial court, the defence counsel had submitted a matriculation certificate of the accused as a proof of his date of birth to substantiate his claims. The counsel had claimed that there was a similarity regarding the age of juveniles in both the cases.

On the other hand, special public prosecutor B D Gupta had pleaded that the defence had filed the revision petition after a delay of months, so it was non-maintainable and the accused should be tried as an adult as his age was between 16 and 18 years age and he had committed a heinous offence.

On February 9, a group of miscreants had allegedly gang-raped a 20-year-old student after holding her and her friend hostage at Issewal.

Police had booked 10 unidentified accused in the case and arrested six of them in the case.
