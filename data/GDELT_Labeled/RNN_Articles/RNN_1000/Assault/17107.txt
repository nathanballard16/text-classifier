SURAT: Nearly three months after a 14-year-old girl was raped, the Pandesara police arrested two minor-aged brothers for the crime.The girl was sexually assaulted in August and had also informed her mother, but the latter could not muster courage to approach police as her husband was in their native village in Uttar Pradesh (UP).The brothers aged 17 and 14 were arrested on Tuesday after the survivor’s mother lodged a complaint. They were booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including sexual assault and rape and sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act.The crime was committed on August 20 when the girl’s mother had gone for work while her father was in their native place since July 27. Her seven-year-old brother was also at home during the day when younger of the two accused came to their room. He asked the survivor’s brother to go out and play. After he left, the accused first started sexually harassing the girl and later raped her. He even threatened to kill her.The boy left after raping her but the traumatized girl remained in room. After a while, she went out to call her brother, but two accused did not allow him to go and the girl returned home alone. After couple of hours, the 17-year-old went to her home and raped her.When her mother returned in the evening, the girl complained about severe pain in lower body. When her mother probed further, she narrated the ordeal to her and broke down.When the woman informed her husband over phone, he asked them to wait till he returned.“The brothers were produced in the court and sent to a juvenile home,” said a police officer at Pandesara police station.
