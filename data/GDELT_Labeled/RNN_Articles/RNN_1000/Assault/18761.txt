Will Justice Be Done? Man Beats A Three-Year-Old Female Dog To Death With A Wooden Pole

There was an outrage in Mumbai when a dog named Lucky was beaten to death by security guards of a building.

Now, news of another little dog being beaten to death in Mumbai, has come forward. A three-year-old female dog called Sweety was hacked to death with a wooden pole while she was asleep at Phoolpada in Virar (east).





"The residents of Jha Niwas had informed me on Friday (November 22) that Rakesh Sahani had repeatedly hit Sweety in the afternoon. By the time some of the locals rushed to save her, Sweety had been terribly injured and was writhing in pain," TOI quoted honorary district animal welfare officer, Mitesh Jain as saying.

Jain with 20 other locals went to the Virar police station the same day and lodged an FIR against Sahani on charges of animal cruelty.

Sweety was rushed to the hospital but she succumbed to her injuries.

Punishment for people who indulge in animal cruelty is negligible in our country - that's one of the reasons why people get away with murder, when it comes to animals.

How inhuman and devoid of emotion do you have to be, to beat a sleeping dog to death? It's cruel and barbaric, and unless such acts are strictly punished, such people will continue to get away, with nothing to discourage such behaviour (since, clearly, they don't have a conscience).
