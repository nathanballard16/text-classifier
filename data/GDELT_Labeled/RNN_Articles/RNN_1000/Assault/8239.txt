64-year-old held for rape bid on daughter-in-law

Ludhiana: The police on Wednesday arrested a 64-year-old man for trying to rape his daughter-in-law.

The 32-year-old woman said in her police complaint, “I got married to the son of the accused in 2010. We have two children. After marriage, I came to know that my husband was a drug addict and dependent on his family financially.”

She said her father-in-law, a grocer, has been sexually harassing her from the past three months. “When I told my brother about it, he asked me to make a video of it. On Tuesday, when my father-in-law was harassing me, I recorded his misdeeds and rushed to my room. Following me to my room, he tried to rape me. I raised the alarm and rushed out.”

She then called up the police.

Assistant sub-inspector Janak Raj said, “The man has been arrested on attempt to rape charge.”
