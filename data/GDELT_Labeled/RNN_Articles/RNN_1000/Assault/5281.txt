Capacity building program for women held in Tura

TURA: A two-day capacity building programme on Constitutional and Legal Rights of Women for members of Seng Kynthei/ Women Organszation was held at Bakdil Training Centre, Danakgre, Tura. The programme was organised under Access to Justice, NE and JK Project by Meghalaya State Commission for Women (MSCW) in association with the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.

Vice-Chairperson, MSCW, Gamchi T R Marak in her introductory address stated that the primary objective of the capacity building programme is to disseminate information on constitutional and legal rights of women in order to improve the status of women in the society.

Referring to gender discrimination, economic disparity and various other challenges faced by women in the society, she said that awareness is necessary and women should know their rights and learn to live in dignity in the society.

Annie Sohtun, Coordinator, MSCW while explaining about the topic “Understanding Gender and Power Relations” during the programme stated that gender discrimination and inequality still persisted and it was the society that had created the rift between men and women and these social constructions were creating an imbalance in our society. “Therefore, we need to change our mindset and give equal responsibility and share the workload at home with our male counterparts in our family and thereby create an atmosphere of fair gender equality”, she said.

Meanwhile, in the technical session, a lecture on “Criminal Law and Women, including Sexual assault, rape, cyber crime, etc.”, was delivered by Inspector of Police, Janice K Marak, Investigation Cell, West Garo Hills, Tura while “The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and the Role of the Service Providers” was spoken about by a representative from District Social Welfare, Tura.

An awareness campaign on the rights of women will also be held at Rongram market on Saturday where the participants of this capacity building programme would sensitize the people on the rights of women and ensure that they were protected from discrimination and harassment in the society.
