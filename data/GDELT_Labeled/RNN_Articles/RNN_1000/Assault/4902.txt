Stalin flays TN government for naming Pollachi girl

Opposition leaders came down heavily, here on Thursday, on the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government for revealing the identity of a Pollachi sex abuse victim.

The government in its order transferring the Pollachi sexual abuse-cum-blackmail case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had mentioned the name of a victim.

DMK President M.K. Stalin said as per the Supreme Court's directives names of sexual assault victims should not be revealed. Stalin said the government in its order transferring the case to the CBI had not only mentioned the girl's name but also the college in which she is studying.

The DMK leader said it is a blatant violation of the rule by the AIADMK government so as to prevent other girls from lodging a complaint and also to save the culprits.

Condemning the state government for revealing the name, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran said after this other victims would be reluctant to lodge a complaint.

Meanwhile, the Crime Branch-Crime Investigation Department (CBCID) that is probing the case questioned the family members of the main accused Thirunavukkarasu.
