MP: 8 juvenile rape-murder undertrials dig hole in wall; escape observation home

The incident exposes the loopholes in the security arrangement of the juvenile observation home.

Bhopal: In a daring attempt to evade the law, eight juvenile undertrials escaped from the observation home where they were lodged. The incident occurred in Jabalpur where the eight juveniles were accused of serious crimes like rape and murder.

In a scene straight out of a movie, the eight undertrials dug a hole in the wall of the room where they were lodged and then went on to scale the boundary wall of the compound. They were methodological in their approach and escaped in the night when security was lax.

The incident exposes the loopholes in the security arrangement of the juvenile observation home. The crime allegations levelled against the eight juveniles on the run are heinous in nature and they are all allegedly dangerous.

Such an escape bid also proved that the eight juveniles were hardened individuals who were capable of shrewd tactics in order to avoid justice. Moreover, since they have been accused of rape and murder, it would be safe to assume that the police did not properly factor-in the danger the accused can cause in a bid to hide their tracks.
