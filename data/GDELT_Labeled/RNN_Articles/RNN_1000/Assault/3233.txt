NEW DELHI, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed and six others injured Saturday in a blast inside a carpet factory in northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, police said.

The blast took place at Rohta Bazaar in Bhadohi district, about 257 km southeast of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.

"Today a blast took place inside a carpet factory (two-storey building) here in which 10 people were killed and six others are said to be injured," a police official said. "The injured have been hospitalized."

Witnesses said blast was so powerful that it reduced the building into rubble and led to the collapse of three adjacent houses.

Following the blast locals informed police and carried out rescue work.

Disaster response force personnel have reached the spot to carry out searches in the rubble.

Police suspects the blast was caused due to the firecrackers stored inside the building.

Reports said the owners used the building for making fireworks also.

Accidental explosions are common at Indian fireworks factories and shops.
