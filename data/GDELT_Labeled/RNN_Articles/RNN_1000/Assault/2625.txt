Bizmen ready to incur losses for nation

The step of imposing high import duty on Pakistan should have been taken way back. Ludhiana: A day after Union government hiked custom duty to 200% on goods imported from Pakistan to India in the wake of the Pulwama attack, businessmen have hailed the decision. At the same time, this step is also going to hurt the business prospects of our fellow Indian businessmen who are importing Pakistani goods as the cost of goods will shoot manifold and the sales will be hit hard. The businessmen have also assured government that they are ready to incur losses in national interest and government should not hesitate in taking strong measures to end terrorism from across the border.Speaking to TOI, Harish Dua, leading garment manufacturer and president of knitwear and apparel exporters organisation said, “Hiking of import duty on the goods being imported from Pakistan is definitely going to hurt the economy of Pakistan. But, we are ready for bearing this loss in national interest as we no more can bear the loss of lives of our brave jawans and innocent citizens.”Narinder Chugh, executive council member of Apparel Export Promotion Council, said, “On one side we are importing goods from Pakistan and on the other hand it is exporting terrorism into India and killing our soldiers and officers.
