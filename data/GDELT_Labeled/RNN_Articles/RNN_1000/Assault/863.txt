A traffic policeman was seriously injured after a speeding government bus ran into him in Guduvanchery on Friday. The CCTV visuals of the incident are going viral on social media. The incident took place at around 11.30 am on Friday.

The video footage shows a traffic policeman regulating vehicular movement on what appears to be a busy road. After a few seconds, he moves to the middle of the road, raising his left arm up, signalling vehicles to stop. A motorcycle rider is seen obeying the policeman’s signs and halting.

Suddenly, a speeding bus is seen ramming into the police constable, who for a split second tries to get out of the vehicle’s way but hit by the bus. The speeding bus does not stop and is seen ramming into a second man standing at the side of the road. It finally comes to a halt a few metres away.

The traffic constable, identified as Arun Selvan, was critically injured in the incident.

Speaking to TNM about the accident, a police officer at the Guduvanchery police station said that two men who were injured were taken to a hospital and one of them was discharged on Saturday morning. Traffic constable Arun Selvan is currently undergoing treatment at SRM hospital.
