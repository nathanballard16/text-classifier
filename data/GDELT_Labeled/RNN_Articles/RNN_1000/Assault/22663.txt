Vadodara: The rain of stones on policemen in Hathikhana on December 20 remains a puzzle for the investigators.

The cops were taken by surprise as they didn’t expect thousands of stones would be hurled at them within a matter of few minutes. Crime branch, which has been handed the investigation into the violence, are now focussing on the source of so many stones.

“We are trying to ascertain how so many stones landed up in that narrow Mahavat lane. The locals said that the rioters got the stones from the debris of a building inside the lane. But it is not possible to get so many without prior planning,” said a senior police official.

In the past, many miscreants were known to break footpaths for stocking stones to be used during rioting in the city. However, there are no proper footpaths in the area where rioting broke out.

A video shot by a local shows a big stock of debris lying at an isolated spot in the lane. The rioters picked up stones from the debris in buckets and brought them outside to pelt at the policemen. Three policemen were injured in stone pelting and several vehicles parked in the lane were damaged.

“It is to be ascertained if the debris was from some building or the stones were stocked in advance by some mischief mongers,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police (crime).

Police had used drones in the old areas to check if some miscreants had stored the stones on the terraces of the houses. However, police couldn’t check the terraces in the interior parts due to logistical issues.

“Once all the rioters are arrested, we will try to find out how so many stones landed at the spot. It was a pre-planned conspiracy,” a police official added.
