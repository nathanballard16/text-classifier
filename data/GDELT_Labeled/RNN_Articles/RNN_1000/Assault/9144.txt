New Delhi: In the latest development in the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, the Supreme Court on Monday granted three months to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to wrap its probe. The apex court said that the probe should be completed including the murder aspect in the now infamous case that involved sexual assault on many minors.

The case came to light after the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) filed a report about the rampant sexual and physical abuse at the NGO-run shelter home in Muzaffarpur. It was found that the influential NGO owners had been torturing the girls at the shelter home for a long time with reports of neighbours turning a deaf ear to the cries of the girls when they were being abused.

The Supreme Court vacation bench, comprising of Justices Indu Malhotra and MR Shah, told the CBI to also probe the claims of unnatural sexual assault under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The apex court also asked the investigative agency to examine the video recordings of the of the girls being assaulted at the Muzaffarpur shelter home.

Moreover, apart from giving three months to the CBI for covering the probe, the SC has also asked the investigative agency to look at the role of people from outside the shelter home who had helped the staff and owners of the place.
