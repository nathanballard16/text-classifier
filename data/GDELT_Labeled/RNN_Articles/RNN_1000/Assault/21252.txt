Lucknow: In yet another tragedy which is being reported from the state of Uttar Pradesh, an 18-year-old girl was allegedly raped and set ablaze by her distant uncle in Fatehpur district on Friday. She is battling for her life with 90 per cent burns, said police officials investigating the matter.

An FIR has been registered in this regard against the main accused, a 22-year-old who is also the victim's distant relative. Circle Officer Kapil Dev Mishra said that the girl was romantically involved with the accused and both their families had held a panchayat to reach a settlement and get them married. However, the accused barged into her home on December 13 when she was alone. He reportedly raped her and set her on fire.

The incident took place under the jurisdiction of the Hussainganj police station. More details are awaited as this is a developing story and the police are still making efforts to nab the accused and ascertain what led to this vicious attack.

A similar tragedy in UP's Unnao earlier this month sent shivers down the spine of citizens who continue to place their faith in the power of law and order. A rape survivor was attacked and set ablaze while on her way to court by the accused. Out on bail, they set her on fire and left her to die. She was airlifted to Delhi and succumbed to 90 per cent burn injuries at the Safdarjung Hospital in the national capital.
