New Delhi: Aligarh police arrested Hindu Mahasabha's national secretary Pooja Shakun Pandey and her husband Ashok Pandey from Tappal, for recreating Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination. Earlier, five people were arrested for allegedly burning an effigy of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary. As per the police reports, the suspects allegedly belonged to the right-wing All India Hindu Mahasabha.

Pandey had shot at Gandhi’s effigy using an artificial gun, after which ‘blood’ started flowing out of the effigy. The appalling incident was reported from Aligarh on January 30, a day which is observed as ‘Martyr’s Day’ to commemorate Gandhi’s death anniversary. The Hindu Mahasabha leader also garlanded the statue of Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who had shot dead Gandhi in 1948.

This is not the first time that Pandey sparked controversy. Last year in August, Pandey had said if she was born ahead of Godse, she would have killed Gandhi. Making the controversial statement, Pandey also warned the followers of Gandhi and said she will shoot anyone if they try to become another Mahatma. She also blamed him for the partition of the country which led to the death of several lakhs of Hindus.

After the video of the incident went viral on social media, the cops booked Pandey her husband Ashok and 12 others under section 147,148,149, 295A and 153A for rioting, promoting enmity and hurting feelings of a section of society.

Nathuram Godse was sentenced to death and was subsequently hanged to death on 15 November 1949 at Ambala jail.
