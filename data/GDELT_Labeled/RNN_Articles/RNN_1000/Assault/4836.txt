Mumbai: Over a decade after he was booked by police on charges of rape and impregnation of a minor, a 76-year-old retired lecturer was let off by a bench of the Bombay High Court. The suspect managed to produce medical records before the court, furnishing proof that he has undergone a vasectomy and was incapable of impregnating the complainant.

The case dates back to November of 2008 when the suspect was booked by police based on claims by his maidservant who accused him of sexually assaulting and impregnating her, reported Hindustan Times. A case was registered against the retired lecturer from Amravati based on a complaint by the mother of the maidservant, who was 17-year-old at the time.

After investigating the matter, police filed a charge sheet against the accused who in turn, moved the HC after the trial court on May 7, 2012, turned down his request to be discharged from the case. In his final defence, the accused brought the HC's attention to a request he had made to the investigating officer back in March of 2009.

The suspect had asked the officer to requisition the civil surgeon in Amravati to examine his semen. Upon examination, the civil surgeon asserted that there was no active sperm in the suspect's semen making it impossible for him to impregnate any female. Justice MG Giratkar took cognizance of these facts and concluded that the suspect, who was a 65-year-old at the time of the incident, could not have impregnated the complainant.
