Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday ordered an official inquiry in the delay of an FIR registered in the gangrape of a Dalit woman in Thanagazzi in Alwar district, which took place on April 26.

Ashok Gehlot has also asked divisional commissioner of Jaipur to look into administrative lapses, which caused the delay of an FIR in the case.

He said police would investigate the case and all other rape cases under priority with a particular officer assigned to it.

A woman was raped by five men in front of her husband in Rajasthan's Alwar district.

The accused had brutally beaten the couple, took off their clothes and also made a video of the incident.

The couple informed about the incident to the superintendent of police Rajeev Pachar on April 30.

Yet the police got the medical examination of the victim on May 1 and lodged an FIR on May 2.

An FIR was lodged on May 2 under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and SC/ST Act against five accused.

And the investigations began on May 7 after the accused released the rape video of the woman on social media.

Experts have pointed out that it is a criminal offense to delay registration of rape case and subsequent medical examination, as the victim was first asked to undergo medical examination for two days.

Meanwhile former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje accused the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in the state of ignoring atrocities against women that have been on the rise due to inaction.

She also went on to advise the state government to take prompt and stern actions against the culprits.
