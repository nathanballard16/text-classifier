Kuljeet Kaur, 60, was living in the house alone in Sector-31 from where the body was recovered late on Tuesday night, the police said. She is a Supreme Court lawyer.

“She was married to Navjot Singh, a retired Army officer and was fighting a property dispute case in Supreme Court against her own family,” a police spokesperson said.

She had hired a married couple one week ago as domestic helps, but the duo is missing since the incident came to light, the spokesperson said.
