Modi dedicates Indo-Russian Rifles Pvt Ltd in Amethi to nation

The respective intergovernmental agreement was prepared and signed in the shortest possible time. In this regard, I would like to express gratitude to Russian and Indian specialists, to all those who so promptly made this project happen.
