Capital police refuse to lodge rape complaint, send survivor to another station

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

BHUBANESWAR: A 28-year-old rape survivor was made to run pillar to post between different police stations and taught on police jurisdiction before she was able to register a complaint against her perpetrators on Tuesday.The Kolkata-based woman, who approached the Capital police station on Tuesday afternoon to lodge a complaint about the sexual harassment she had to face at the hands of four men in a hotel in the Laxmisagar area on Monday night, was first taught about police jurisdiction and later told to go the concerned police station as the alleged crime did not occur under its area.“I was looking for the nearest police station to lodge a complaint about my harrowing experience. I reached Raj Mahal Square while searching for one and then, a passer-by guided me to the Capital police station. However, men at the police station told me that the incident happened under the Laxmisagar police station limits and lodge a complaint there,” the woman said, adding that she was not aware of the areas in Bhubaneswar.The rape survivor added that even though she narrated her ordeal before the capital police, they refused to lodge a case there, citing jurisdictional issues.When contacted, inspector in-charge of the Capital police station, Girija Chakraborty, confirmed that the woman approached his police station for help. Chakraborty said, “We found that the alleged incident took place in a hotel under the Laxmisagar police station limits. We dropped the complainant there and coordinated with the station officials.”An officer of the Laxmisagar police station said they registered a case of gang-rape based on the woman’s complaint. “Efforts are being made to arrest the accused. The complainant is unable to identify the persons who allegedly sexually assaulted her in her room,” he added.The Capital police have drawn flak for not registering the complaint. A senior lawyer in the state, Sidharth Das, said, “We have a zero FIR system where police can register cases, irrespective of jurisdiction, whenever a complaint related to cognizable offence is received at the police station.” He added that Capital police should have immediately registered the case and started an investigation and later transferred it to the Laxmisagar police station after adopting necessary legal formalities.The incident has raised questions on the commissionerate police’s approach in handling women in distress.
