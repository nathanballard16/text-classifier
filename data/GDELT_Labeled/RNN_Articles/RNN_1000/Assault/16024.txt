New Delhi: The Uttar Pradesh Police on Tuesday detained the girl, who accused former union minister and BJP leader Swami Chinmayanand of rape, for questioning in connection with alleged extortion from the accused.

The big question we are asking on The Urban Debate today is whether the UP police are trying to intimidate the girl complainant.

Speaking during the debate, senior Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy termed the entire incident troubling as it took so long to register a case of rape.

She said, "However, in this alleged extortion case, we have a woman fleeing the state because she felt she isn't going to get justice. Here is a massive imbalance of power. A former BJP minister was referred to as Baba by a member of the Special Task Force (STF) probing the case."

@karunanundy, SC Lawyer: It took the police so long to register a case of rape. If a police officer doesn't register the case then the officer under Sec 166A is liable to be proceeded criminally w/o any govt permission@fayedsouza pic.twitter.com/e2KodDyNe6 — Mirror Now (@MirrorNow) September 24, 2019

Earlier, a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court denied anticipatory bail to the girl, a law student from Shahjahanpur. The girl's two friends are already in STF custody in connection with the alleged extortion case.

Speaking during the debate, senior journalist Sharat Pradhan alleged that UP police are working under the pressure of political dispensation.

He said, "Police always find an alibi or an escape route for people in power. That is exactly what they (police) seem to be doing in this case. It reminds me of what the Akhilesh Yadav government did in Badaun rape case that they managed to prove it to be a case of suicide. Likewise, you see the Unnao case, how complacent the police were. The MLA was roaming all across and they did not want to arrest him and continued to claim that he was at large."

Earlier, a local has rejected the bail plea of BJP leader and rape accused Swami Chinmayanand, who was arrested on Saturday.

Speaking on the issue, BJP leader Anita Agarwal said the STF is carrying out its investigation into the case fairly and that BJP is not trying to save anyone.

"Today, Chinmayanand is not a BJP member. Nobody is defending the accused. The law is taking its own course and we trust the law. The court has also expressed satisfaction with the probe. The government is not at all interfering with the probe. Nobody will be spared under the Yogi Adityanath government," said Anita Aggarwal.
