Adhir Chowdhury blames BJP for ‘worsening’ situation in Valley

Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Chowdhury, visited the houses of the victims in Murshidabad Wednesday, a day after five labourers from the district were shot dead and another was injured by terrorists in Kulgam district of South Kashmir. He asked the Union Home Ministry to open a helpline number for families of other Bengal labourers who are stuck in Kashmir. He also organised a candle-light vigil at Sagardighi village on Wednesday evening.

“People are scared now. There are several labourers from Bengal who are stuck in Kashmir with no mobile connectivity. I have asked the Union Home Secretary to start a helpline number immediately, so that their families can get in touch with them. The government must provide jobs to these families and the Centre should ensure protection to these labourers,” Chowdhury said.

“The situation in the Valley is becoming worse with every passing day. It is going out of our hands because of the wrong policies of the central government, which is only busy trying to hide the real situation,” Chowdhury told reporters after meeting the family members of the victims at Sagardighi.

He slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre for allegedly pursuing “wrong policies” that led to “worsening” of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

He also wrote to PM Narendra Modi seeking financial assistance for the bereaved families and requested him to send an all-party delegation to Kashmir to assess the situation.
