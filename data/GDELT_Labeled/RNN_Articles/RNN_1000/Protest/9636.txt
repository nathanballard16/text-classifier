According to Deccan Chronicle reports, SIT probing the scam running over Rs 2,000 crores will soon be calling Baig for questioning due to his friendship with the managing director Mohammed Mansoor Khan, main accused of I Monetary Advisory (IMA) jewel scam, who fled the country on June 8. The development comes days after Khan, prominently in the audio clip had alleged Mr. Baig of taking Rs 400 crore from him and refused to return the money. Following an inquiry, the Congress party on Tuesday suspended MLA R Roshan Baig from the party with immediate effect for indulging in “anti-party activities.”“All India Congress Committee has approved the proposal sent by KPCC to take action against R Roshan Baig, MLA, on account of his anti-party activities. Earlier, scores of investors staged protests outside the office of IMA Jewels at Sivaji Nagar, asking the firm to return their money.
