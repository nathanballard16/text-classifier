New Delhi, November 20

The Congress has called a meeting of its Lok Sabha members on Wednesday to discuss Parliament strategy. The meeting will be presided over by Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairman Sonia Gandhi.

The Congress wants to corner the government on issues concerning public, economic slowdown, farmersâ€™ distress and unemployment. The party does not want to deviate on other issues which, it claims, are being created by the ruling party as a part of their strategy.

The party also wants to raise the issue of pollution and air quality in the National Capital region (NCR). On Tuesday, the Congress initiated a debate in the House on the issue of pollution and asked the government to do something more to control the menace.

Sonia also raised concerns on ongoing pollution levels in the capital while speaking at an award ceremony. The Congress has been protesting against the government on all these issues since November 5.

It also wants to raise the issue of electoral bonds and is trying to garner support from other opposition parties.

The party has alleged that the scheme of electoral bonds amounts to money laundering as people cannot know which corporates donated money to whom and what benefits they reaped as a result. IANS
