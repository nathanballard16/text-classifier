International Political Scenario for Dominican Republic 2 – 9 August 2019

Civic demonstrations are planned in San Francisco de Macorís on 7 August. Civil society groups, including the Popular Movement of San Francisco de Macorís, called for a 24-hour protest strike involving locals suspending their own labour and commercial activities. There is a risk of security forces using tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters if they attempt to stage roadblocks. Property damage against government and private assets is highly unlikely.
