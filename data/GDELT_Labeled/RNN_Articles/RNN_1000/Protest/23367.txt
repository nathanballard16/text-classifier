Nothing anti-minority in CAA, opposition campaign false: Amit Shah

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said there was nothing against minorities in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and accused the opposition of engaging in a "false" campaign over the legislation.

Speaking at India Economic Conclave here, Shah said no action is being taken against students protesting against the CAA, which was passed by Parliament last week and has received Presidential assent.

However, action is being taken only against those engaging in vandalism and arson during protests, he said.

Amid raging protests over the CAA, Shah said there was nothing "anti-minority" in the legislation, which seek to provide Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Hitting at the opposition, he said it is engaged in "false" campaign over the new Citizenship Act.
