Students stage demonstration in Kanchanpur against border encroachment by India

KANCHANPUR, Nov 10: Students affiliated with the student wing of Netra Bikram Chand-led Nepal Communist Party on Sunday staged a demonstration in Mahendranagar on Sunday against the Indian encroachment upon Nepali territory Kalapani.

Hundreds of students belonging to All Nepal National Free Students Union (Revolutionary) took to the street against the latest Indian move.

A rally of the students led by regional coordination committee coordinator Birendra Shah marched various parts of the city and converged into an assembly at local Madan Chowk.

ANNFSU central committee member Babarjung Singh and Kanchanpur chairman of ANNFSU Narendra Bhat addressed the assembly.

Unveiling a new political map on November 2, the Indian government placed Nepali territory Kalapani inside Indian borders.

Earlier last week, Nepal strongly opposed the Indian move while asserting that the country would not tolerate any unilateral actions carried out by India on the Nepali territory.

Even though historical facts show that Kalapani is a Nepali territory, the Indian paramilitary force has been illegally stationing there since the India-China war in 1962.
