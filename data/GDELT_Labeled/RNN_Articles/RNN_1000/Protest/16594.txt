Banking operations all over India have been disrupted as trade unions have announced a nationwide strike on October 22.The strike has been jointly called by All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) against the government's decision of merging several banks.In a circular released by AIBEA, it said, " The government talks of including every citizen into banking access through schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana, etc., but in contradiction to its own decision announcing the merger of 10 banks, which will result in large scale closure of branches and deprive people of banking service. It is the most retrograde move."Besides AIBEA and BEFI, many other unions have also extended their support to the strike, including All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC) and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).However, theis expected to function smoothly as it is not a part of the strike. Many branches of Bank Of Baroda and Bank of Maharashtra are also functioning across the city and its suburbs."There is no evidence that previous mergers in SBI, Bank of Baroda, etc. have yielded any positive results. This is not the time to experiment with merger of banks when Banks are required to play a crucial role in lifting the economy out of its present serious mess and crisis," AIBEA said in the statement."This is deliberate attempt as the entire attention of Banks will now shift from efforts to recover the huge bad loans to tackling the problems arising out of mergers since Government is unable to take any serious measure to recover the bad loans from the corporate defaulters except through huge write off, haircuts and concessions," AIBEA said.On August 30, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the merger of a number of public sector banks, bringing down their total number from 12 to 27.was merged withwas amalgamated with Indian Bank, Unitedandwere merged with Punjab National Bank, and Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank were consolidated with Union Bank of India.
