India steps up security and shuts internet

Indian authorities have stepped up security in major cities and mobile data services were suspended in some places amid nationwide protests against a new citizenship law. Two peaceful protests are taking place in Mumbai over the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens, not very far from each other.

While hundreds of students and social activists have gathered at the Azad Maidan in south Mumbai to protest against the Citizenship Act, four kilometers away, at the August Kranti Maidan, hundreds have turned up in support of the law that for the first time makes religion the test of citizenship in India.

The pro-Citizenship Act rally at August Kranti Maidan is being led by BJP leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Apart from Mumbai, protests against the Citizenship Act are also being held in Delhi and Kolkata today.

Meanwhile, Army chief Bipin Rawat criticized the protests against the new citizenship law. This was the first official comment on the citizenship law by Rawat, who retires on December 31. The Army chief’s comment drew sharp reactions.

Congress’ national media panelist, Shama Mohamed, said on Twitter: “One of the reasons India’s Army is highly respected around the world is because it is apolitical. Such political comments are unbecoming of an Army chief. The political neutrality of the Indian Army shouldn’t be compromised under any circumstances!”

Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav said, “Chief Rawat’s comments on politics are a sharp departure from the convention of the India Army.”
