Allahabad parking ban: Banners out, shopkeepers up ante against traffic cops

ALLAHABAD: Black and white banners lined storefronts on Civil Lines’ Sardar Patel Marg on Wednesday as local shopkeepers refused to end their protest against the recent parking ban on the lane.Over 100 shopkeepers had put up the banners, which drew curious passersby.Riled over the drop in sales due to the parking restriction, traders said that they would continue with their protest till their demands were met with.Implemented in July, the new rule prohibits parking of vehicles in front of shops located in SP Marg’s third lane. A violation of the rule ends in either the vehicle being towed away or a fine being levied on the vehicle owner.Printed in Hindi, the banner reads: “Dukhad and aur vicharaniya, grahakon ka Civil Lines mein parking vyavastha ke naam par prashasanik utpeedan ke karan yeh dukan bandi ki kagaar par hai (This shop is on the verge of closure due to constant harassment of customers in Civil Lines by the authorities in the name of parking management).”President of Civil Lines Vyapar Mandal Sushil Kharbanda said, “Over 100 shop owners have put up these banners outside their shops to protest against the rigid attitude of the traffic police. They continue to harass customers by levelling fines and shopkeepers.”“We were forced to take this step after the authorities turned a blind eye to our efforts to reach an amicable solution. We had presented memorandums and also approached the district administration, but it was all in vain,” he added.“The parking restrictions have taken a toll on our daily business. Ever since the ban was enforced two months back, shops at SP Marg have registered 50-70% decline in sales,” said one of the shop owners who had put up the banner in front of his shop.Meanwhile, SP (traffic) Kuldeep Singh maintained that the police will not roll-back the ban and parking on SP Marg’s third lane would continue to be prohibited.
