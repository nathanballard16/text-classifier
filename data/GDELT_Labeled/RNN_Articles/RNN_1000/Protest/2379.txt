Support pours in from various quarters for fasting yoga guru

Agitation will be intensified, says convener of outfit

Guru Baba Ramdev’s disciple Sri Ramakishan, who is on an indefinite fast seeking Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh, received support from the Pratyeka Hoda Vibhajana Hameela Sadhana Samiti (PHVHSS) and political parties on Tuesday.

Calling on Mr. Ramakishan at the C.V.N. Reading Room, PHVHSS convener Chalasani Srinivas said that there was a growing realisation among leaders cutting across party lines that without SCS, the fledgling state of A.P. could not achieve sustainable growth.

“The struggle would be taken to New Delhi and will be intensified in order to put pressure on the Centre to fulfil promises made in Parliament at the time of bifurcation,” Mr. Srinivas said.

He appealed to Mr. Ramakishan, whose fast entered the seventh day on Tuesday, to not risk his life by prolonging his fast and asked him to join the PHVHSS in its struggle instead.

Joining cause

However, the yoga guru made it clear that he would continue his indefinite fast till the Centre conceded the demand for SCS.

Expressing solidarity with the fasting yoga guru, former Minister and senior YSR Congress leader Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said his party would extend support after the Lok Sabha elections only to a party or a combination of parties at the Centre which committed itself to granting SCS to A.P.. Meanwhile, Telugu Desam Party district president and Ongole MLA D. Janardhana Rao said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu would observe a day’s fast in New Delhi seeking SCS on February 11. Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists State General Secretary I.V. Subba Rao, City Congress president Sripathi Prakasam and Seva Dal State Secretary K. Subba Rao were among those who extended support to the yoga guru’s hunger strike.
