THE CONGRESS government in Chhattisgarh is looking to up the ante against the Centre on the issue of paddy procurement, with plans to hold a protest in Delhi on November 15. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel had reiterated in October the demand to let them acquire paddy at Rs 2,500 per quintal from the Centre and for it to buy excess paddy into the central pool. Baghel said on Sunday that the central government had turned down this request. He added that the Congress would continue to urge the Centre to relax its stance.
