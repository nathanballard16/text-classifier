SC Warns Of Intervention In Case Allahabad HCBA Strike Is Not Called Off

The Supreme Court has warned that if the long drawn strike by the Allahabad High Court Bar Association continued, it will have to "work out the certain modalities so that the people are not deprived of the judicial remedy".



Last week the bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M R Shah had criticized the call for strike observing that "Bar Associations are not supposed to settle their demands by resorting to strikes which may lead to nothing but delaying the justice to litigants". The Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, Justice Govind Mathur had also issued a notice, appealing the advocates to end their strike and resume work.

The HCBA resorted to strike on August 27 as an expression of their protest over the 'UP Education Service Tribunal Bill, 2019' which proposes setting up of education tribunals in Lucknow.

The Bar Association submitted before the court that they will consider calling off the strike. Accordingly, the matter has been posted for September 11.

The HCBA is set to meet on Monday morning.
