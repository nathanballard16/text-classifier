May Day 2019: India’s labour day comes at the cost of 570,000 job losses and 297 deaths

India’s labour ministry has been pushing to reform the labour codes in the country but there’s no progress so far. The draft for Wages Bill 2017 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year but the ministry is still waiting for the panel report.



The Rajasthan Assembly was the first to amend four key labour laws in India. The state was the first to allow factories with less than 300 workers to fire them without any permission from authorities. Back in 1982, factories having less than 100 workers were allowed to fire them at any given point of time.
