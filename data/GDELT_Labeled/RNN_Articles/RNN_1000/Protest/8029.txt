Students, Faculty Of DU’s St Stephen’s College Protest Interference Of Supreme Council In Admission Process

A protest was carried out outside Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College yesterday (17 May) by members of faculty and the student body of the varsity who were concerned about the interference of the varsity’s supreme council in the process of admissions, reports Hindustan Times.

Some 60 protesters or demonstrated against the decision of the college administration to hand over the admission process to a member of the governing body member who would be selected by the supreme council. The supreme council itself is made up of six members of the Church of North India.

“The process of management interfering with the admission process can hamper the admission process,” said alumnus Steven Kunnath.

Some members of DU’s academic and executive council have also communicated a letter to vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, asking him to get sort the situation out.

A faculty member who is part of the governing body stated that the supreme council’s role is limited to maintaining the Christian character of the institute and appointing the principal, but they have no authority over the process of admissions.
