Attention! New IISc research finds how midbrain helps

BENGALURU: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on Thursday said they have identified how a key midbrain region plays a vital role in attention in humans, using advanced imaging and modelling techniques.“Human brain is constantly bombarded with information. It is through attention that it makes decisions efficiently: It processes relevant information and tunes out distractions. Understanding how attention works in the brain and how it controls behaviour can help scientists understand disorders such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),” a statement released here read.The research has been conducted by Devarajan Sridharan, assistant professor at IISc’s Centre for Neuroscience and his PhD student Varsha Sreenivasan, who recently published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Stating that attention is widely associated with the outermost layer of the brain tissue called the cerebral cortex—also linked to awareness, thoughts, memory, language, and consciousness—the researchers said that it was only recently that scientists began linking a midbrain region called the Superior Colliculus (SC) with attention.“SC is an evolutionarily conserved midbrain structure that can be found in all vertebrates. It is usually studied for its role in controlling eye movements,” explains Sreenivasan.And, to demonstrate its role in attention, scientists, in recent years studied behaviour in monkeys. They observed that monkeys were attentive when SC was stimulated and distracted when this part of the brain was silenced.But scientists were unsure how exactly SC promotes attention in humans: Was it focusing on the target visual stimulus over several others for decisions (increased choice bias) or was it enhancing the visual clarity of the target stimulus (increased visual sensitivity)?Bias- or sensitivity-mediated attention plays out in situations that require rapid and selective decision making, for instance, at a traffic signal.To address this debate, in the current study, Sreenivasan and Sridharan conducted two sets of experiments in human participants, using non-invasive techniques. In one, they conducted a behaviour test on 22 participants, where they tracked changes in bias and sensitivity during attention-demanding tasks.In the second experiment, they studied the anatomy of SC in 82 participants, including the 22 tested earlier. Using an imaging technique called diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), and a 3D modelling technique called tractography , they tracked white matter fibres in the brain connecting the SC with other regions, including the cortex.When they compared the results of the two experiments, they found that SC strongly connects with a part of the cerebral cortex called the parietal cortex, which has previously been associated with attention. They also show that the strength of SC-cortex connectivity can predict individuals’ bias, but not sensitivity.“We also show that choice bias is stronger, on average, towards the right side of our visual field. Interestingly, SC connections in the cortex also mirror this asymmetry for bias, which further underscores the relationship between SC and bias,” explains Sridharan.
