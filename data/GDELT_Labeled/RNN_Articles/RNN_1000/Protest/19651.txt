Stir intensifies, Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal says protest a waste of time

GUWAHATI/DIBRUGARH/AIZAWL: Student protesters in Assam on Sunday ransacked the Dibrugarh head office of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), a party born out of a historic student-led anti-foreigner movement, as the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill drove a wedge between organisations that till recently seemed wedded to a common cause.The attack came amid a telling remark by CM Sarbananda Sonowal , who in his younger days had led many student agitations, that it was “a waste of time” fighting the bill. “Protests are not going to change the future of Assam. The younger generation should strive to put Assam on the world stage with hard work, dedication, honesty and sincerity. They should not waste their time participating in a movement like this,” he said at an event in Guwahati.Bristling at the alleged Uturn of the AGP brass on the bill, activists of All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) had barged into the party office located in the heart of Dibrugarh town and damaged whatever they could lay their hands on. AGP members attending a meeting were allegedly heckled, prompting them to flee for fear of assault, party sources said.The protesters dispersed after police arrived from two nearby locations. Dibrugarh SP Gautam Borah said five protesters had been detained on charges of vandalism.”In Mizoram, the synod of the Presbyterian Church of India appealed to all affiliates to stand against the bill. The synod has written to PM Modi on the issue, it said in a statement.Mizo Zirlai Pawl, the largest Mizo student outfit, is also opposed to the bill despite the Union Cabinet exempting northeastern states which have inner-line permits. Mizoram will be part of the dawn-todusk shutdown on Tuesday announced by the North East Students’ Organisation.
