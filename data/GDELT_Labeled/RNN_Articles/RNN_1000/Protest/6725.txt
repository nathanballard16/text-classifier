The students were supported by NSUI and ABVP.“Due to the mistakes in question paper, many students would fail or get less marks. The university said those who attempted the error-ridden questions will get marks, but what about those who did not since they had been wrongly asked,” said a student.The students were also demanding action against the teacher who set the question paper. “The university has not issued a proper notification in the matter. The university officials are trying to fool the students by announcing insufficient steps in a press release,” a student leader said.“We are protesting since 9am, but vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta has not bothered to meet us,” said a student.VNSGU authorities accepted there were mistakes in the question paper and said marks would be given to students who had attempted them. Students said a couple of questions were outside the syllabus.Vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta was not available for his comments.
