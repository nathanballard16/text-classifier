Former legislators ask govt. to reject Citizenship Bill

Dimapur, Jan. 23 (EMN): The Ex-Parliamentarians Association of Nagaland urges the Nagaland government to reject the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill of 2016, taking into account what they say are negative ramifications the controversial bill may have on the people of Nagaland, and the Northeast region.

The association issued a press release on Wednesday informing about a number of resolutions the group stated was taken during a meeting on Jan. 23 in Kohima.

The association stated: “Any sensible Naga is aware of what can be the ramifications of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill of 2016 when enacted as law. The consequences of the Bill will have tremendous adverse impact on Nagaland. The association strongly feels that prevention at this juncture is better than cure.”

The group has resolved to urge the govt. of Nagaland to review its ‘present stance and come out to reject the Bill’ in the outright, along with those of the other states in Northeast that are opposing the Bill.

Likewise, the association appealed to the government of India to withdraw the Bill in the greater interest of citizens who are protesting against the legislation.

On other matters, the association expressed rejection for the Supreme Court’s verdict on homosexuality. The press release read: ‘The Supreme Court of India passed Judgement by which homosexuality was legalized and adultery was decriminalized.

‘Whereas, both by Naga customary practices and Christian ethics, such extra-marital affairs or unnatural sexual activities are considered highly abominable and are therefore a sin.

‘While upholding the values of our Naga ethical principles ,the association refused to accept the ruling by the top court.’
