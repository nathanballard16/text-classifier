Protest in North house over lack of school desks

‘Order will be issued within a week’

The house meeting of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation was disrupted on Monday when councillors protested over the lack of desks in the civic body’s schools.

Congress councillor Poonam, who had been demanding desks in the school in her ward, had raised the issue in several meetings prior to this.

“Last time, I was assured that the matter would be resolved within 15 days but nothing was done,” she said.

On Tuesday, Ms. Poonam took to wearing a flex poster reiterating her demand and sat in the well of the house followed by other councillors.

An AAP councillor said: “For 12 years, students have been sitting on the floor and BJP has been complaining about how funds are not available because recommendations of the Finance Commission were not implemented. Where does money then come from to start smart class rooms and set up computers?”

Responding to the complaints, the Director of Education informed the house that up to 19,400 desks are required by the corporation.

Out of these arrangements are being made for up to 12,000 desks through Corporate Social Responsibility tie-ups. The procurement for up to 8, 000 desks was under process. North Body Commissioner Varsha Joshi assured the house that the order would be issued within a week.

She also said the exercise of redeployment of desks from schools where they were being underutilised would take place as suggested by Congress councillor Mukesh Goyel.
