Locals protest after filthy water enters gurdwara

Ludhiana: Residents of Manjit Nagar, in ward number 47, protested against civic officials for not paying any heed to their complaint regarding choked sewerage which has been a problem for them since the past five months.

Residents resorted to a protest after filthy water entered a gurdwara on Saturday. The residents rued that they had submitted their complaints with officers on every level, be it junior or senior, but till date no action has been taken.

The residents while staging a protest against the authorities raised slogans and demanded that authorities take action as soon as possible, else face protest at MCD zone office if the issue remains unresolved by Monday.

A resident of the area, Krishan Kumar, said, “Nobody has been able to resolve our problems till date.” He said the latest complaint was submitted on July 23 and since then the situation has deteriorated such that even drinking water has started getting mixed with sewerage water.

Another resident of area Dalip Singh said, authorities simply distribute chlorine tablets among residents when they raise complaints citing increase in cases of diarrhoea. He questioned why the authorities have not been able to come to their rescue if the issue is being raised since the past five months.

Area councillor Priya Kaura said, “The sewerage system in the area is very old and is in need of replacement. I have asked the officials to prepare the estimates for installing a new system.” She said the issue will be resolved in the coming days.
