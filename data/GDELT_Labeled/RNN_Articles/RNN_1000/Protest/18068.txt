An 24-year-old man, who was arrested in a theft case, was found dead inside the Moga city-1 police station lock-up Saturday.

While the police claimed that he allegedly hanged himself to death, the victim’s family alleged that he died because of the police torture. A judicial probe has been initiated into the matter.

Police said that Philips was arrested in connection with a theft case Friday and was named in two FIRs earlier in theft cases. Philips was found dead around 4.30 am.

DSP, Moga city, Paramjit Singh said that the CCTV footage shows that the man committed suicide by tearing away the blanket and then hanging himself with the grills of the lock up. He added that autopsy was being done in presence of the magistrate and the judicial probe has been initiated.

However, accusing the police of torturing Philips, his family members protested outside the police station. The victim’s mother also alleged that when she had gone to the police station Friday to give food to her son, the SHO and local munshi allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 1,000 to let her give him food.

The DSP, however, has denied the allegations.
