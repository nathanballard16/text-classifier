Malaysia debate on statute U-turn rages on

KUALA LUMPUR â€¢ As debate rages on over Malaysia's decision not to accede to the founding treaty of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a small group demonstrated outside the Malaysian Parliament yesterday to demand the removal of Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah and Attorney-General Tommy Thomas.

Questions are meanwhile raised over the involvement of four academics who were reported to have presented a "secret" paper to the Conference of Rulers to convince them to reject the Rome Statute.

They had reportedly warned the rulers that the treaty could cause the Malaysian King to lose his immunity in matters under the international court's purview.

The debate over the Rome Statute heated up after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said last Friday that his government is not acceding to the treaty, though it had earlier indicated it would do so. The backtracking angered rights and civil society groups.

But the U-turn was cheered by Malay groups, along with opposition parties Umno and Parti Islam SeMalaysia. They contended that the Malay constitutional monarchs would lose their immunity, while Islam's role would be diluted.

Under the statute, the ICC is able to probe and prosecute in situations where states are "unable" or "unwilling" to do so themselves on four specific major crimes.

The Rome Statute established the ICC as the first permanent, treaty-based international criminal court. Its powers are limited to only four crimes - genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression.

Dubbed the "court of last resort", the ICC prosecutes only individuals, not groups or countries.
