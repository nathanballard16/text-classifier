Chennai: Nalini Sriharan, one of the convicts in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajeev Gandhi, has started a hunger strike in the Vellore prison on Saturday demanding release of all seven convicts in the case.

Nalini began the fast in solidarity with her husband Murugan who is on an indefinite hunger strike for the past eight days.

Nalini submitted a petition to Governor Banwarilal Purohit expressing disappointment over delay in making a decision to release the prisoners in the case.

"I humbly take leave from the earth by going on fast from 9.02.2019, Saturday morning until I attain eternal bliss. Thank You and Good Bye", she wrote in the letter.

In her letter, Nalini said the Governor had not taken a decision on release of the convicts even after the state government recommended a premature release. She stated that they were forced to this situation due to delay in the Governor's decision.
