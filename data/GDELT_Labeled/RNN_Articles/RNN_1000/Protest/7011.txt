Residents enter drainage channel after Tirupur corpn fails to clean it

Tirupur: A group of Bhavani Nagar residents waded into a drainage channel on Friday, in a symbolic protest against the city corporation, which failed to clean it. The residents said that despite continuous requests, the civic body failed to deploy machines to clean the channel. “Since it was not cleaned in the last four months, the channel is overflowing. The situation has affected those staying in more than 400 houses at Bhavani Nagar in ward 22 of the corporation,” a protester said.The corporation had been using sanitary workers to clean the channel once in three or four months, said S Karmegam of Makkal Pathukappu Amaippu. “We requested the authorities to clean it using machines several times. But they ignored our pleas. As a result, sludge and plastic waste blocked the channel. It is now overflowing. Sewage water has inundated roads in many places in Bhavani Nagar. Motorists cannot use many of the roads. Moreover, the situation is posing a threat to the public health, especially that of children and elderly people,” he said.As many as 100 residents staged a protest. Three of them entered the 5f-deep channel.Corporation officials led by zone II sanitary inspector Ramachandran pacified them. “We have been cleaning drainages periodically but this time, rain water flooded the channel. We will soon clear the sludge,” said Ramachandran.
