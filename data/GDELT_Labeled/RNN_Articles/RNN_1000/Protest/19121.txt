Hyderabad rape-murder: Vikramaditya Motwane brings up Kabir Singh to blast Sandeep Vanga

In a fell tweet, filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane censured Kabir Singh director Sandeep Reddy Vanga on Sunday. It all began with Sandeep's comment on the horrific rape and murder of a veterinary doctor on Wednesday night in Hyderabad.

Requesting Warangal Police to take action in the case, Sandeep said in his tweet that "brutal" punishment will instil fear among perpetrators.

"FEAR is the only factor which can change things radically in a society and FEAR should be the new rule. Brutal sentence will set an example. Now every girl in the country needs a firm guarantee. I request @warangalpolice to come into action," Sandeep said in his post.

Vikramaditya Motwane, however, was quick enough to point a fact to Sandeep with reference to his June 2019 release Kabir Singh. Retweeting Sandeep's post, Vikramaditya said, "Will that FEAR stop them from slapping her?"

For those who didn't get the drift, Shahid Kapoor's Kabir Singh slapped Kiara Advani's character Preeti in a particular scene in the controversial film. Kiara played Kabir Singh's girlfriend while the film was criticised by several quarters for its misogynistic scenes and blatant portrayal of toxic masculinity.

Meanwhile, four lorry workers have been accused of the brutal crime in Hyderabad that has sparked massive outrage across the country. Citizens staged angry protests in front of the police station demanding death for the accused.

The 26-year-old veterinarian was gangraped and killed by the accused - they burned her body in Shamshabad. The Cyberabad police nabbed all the four accused from their houses on Friday.
