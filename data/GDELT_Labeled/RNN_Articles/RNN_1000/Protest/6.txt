Uttar Pradesh welcomes New Year in style

People of Uttar Pradesh rung in the New Year in style, with parties, dancing and on-the-road celebrations till the clock ticked to midnight on Tuesday.

In some cities including Lucknow, Kanpur, Moradabad, Aligarh, Agra, Varanasi and Allahabad, people took to streets to celebrate the arrival of 2019.

While the winter chill continued across the state, people braved the fog and icy winds to celebrate.

In Lucknow, eateries, especially bakeries, were jam-packed and roads were choked as people stepped out of their homes to bid adieu to 2018.

Most malls here, and the Lucknow zoo were bustling with people throughout the day on Monday.

Heavy security arrangements had been made to control the crowd and to ensure proper parking in most markets in Kanpur and Lucknow.

Temples and religious places were also flooded with visitors as people prayed for a prosperous year ahead.
