Junior docs in T'gana hold protests in support of WB doctors

: Junior doctors in Hyderabad and other places in Telangana Friday staged protests against the assault on a junior doctor in Kolkata.

The protests were held at major state-run hospitals, including Gandhi hospital and Osamania General hospital in the city, P S Vijayender, a leader of the junior doctors association in Telangana, said.

He claimed that the protests drew a "huge response", with doctors at Warangal, Adilabad and other towns in the state also joining the stir



The protests were held in a novel way at some places, with doctors tying bandages on their heads, Vijayender said.

"Though the protests were mainly held by medicos, private doctors and others also joined the stir," he said.

Vijayander stressed that the issue in West Bengal was not political and said Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee should try to address the core issue.

Junior doctors in West Bengal have been on strike since Tuesday, demanding better security at workplaces after two of their colleagues were attacked and seriously injured at the NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, allegedly by relatives of a patient who died at the hospital.
