Priyanka's dig at Shah on CAA-NRC, says 'understand the chronology', but 'youth will not budge'

New Delhi, Dec 27 ((UNI) Taking a dig at Home Minister Amit Shah over his 'understand the chronology' remarks on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said, youth of this country 'will not budge'.

"Understand the chronology. First they will promise you two crore jobs, Then they will form government. Then they will destroy your universities. Then they will destroy the country's Constitution. Then you will protest. Then they will call you fool, but youngistan (youth of this country) will not budge", Ms Priyanka tweeted in Hindi.

The Congress leader's criticism comes amid the protest against the CAA-NRC across the nation, alleging that it is unconstitutional and anti-Muslim.

Ms Priyanka's reference 'understand the chronology' aimed at Mr Shah, who had said last year that his government will first implement the Constitutional Amendment Bill and then NRC, not only in Bengal but the entire country.

"Aap chronology samajh lijiye. Pehle CAB ayega.. Fir NRC ayega.... Aur sirf Bengal ke liye nahi... saare desh ke liye ayega" Mr Shah had said.

The Congress is opposing the CAA and the implementation of NRC, and the grand old party had held a protest at Rajghat few days ago against the Modi government.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Thursday attacked the ruling regime and said, "RSS Prime Minister is lying to Bharat Mata"

It is expected that the Congress will intensify its protest against the Modi regime as it has already announced that it will take out a flag march across the country on the occasion of party's 134th foundation day on Saturday.
