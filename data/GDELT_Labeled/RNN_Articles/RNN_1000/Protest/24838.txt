Islamabad: In yet another attempt to tarnish India’s image, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, on Thursday, claimed that the country would carry out "an action of some sort" in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to divert world’s attention from Kashmir and the protests against the new citizenship law.

Addressing a public gathering in Jhelum district, the Pakistan PM further said that his army was prepared for any such move.

“I have been telling the world for the past five months that the Modi-RSS government, in order to divert the world attention away from Kashmir and the protests against the (citizenship) law, will definitely conduct some sort of action" in PoK,” Khan was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

He further said he had told Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa about the possible “threats” from India and the General "told me that Pakistan is prepared for them".

Commenting on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens, Khan said that they attracted large-scale protests for being against 200 million Muslims living in India.

Earlier, the Pakistan PM, in a series of tweets, had accused the Indian government of moving systematically with a "Hindu supremacist agenda and also urged the world to step in "before it is too late".

“India, under Modi, has been moving systematically with its Hindu Supremacist agenda. Starting with illegal annexation & continuing siege of IOJK; then stripping 2 mn Indian Muslim in Assam of citizenship, setting up internment camps; now the passage of Citizenship Amendment Law,” he had said on Twitter.
