Act against Rajeev Kumar for violating service rules, directs Centre government

New Delhi: The Centre has directed the West Bengal government to take disciplinary action against Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar for ‘participating’ in a street protest led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee . A Union home ministry note sent to the state chief secretary on Tuesday accused the 1989-batch West Bengal cadre officer of indulging in “indiscipline” and “violating All India Services (conduct) Rules, 1968/ AIS (D&A) Rules, 1969”.The DGP and some other officers were seen at the Metro Channel Station in Kolkata, where Banerjee was leading a dharna. The MHA said it contravened sections 3(1), 5(1) and 7 of the AIS(Conduct) Rules, 1968. It also asked the state to intimate it on the action taken against Kumar. Service rules state that no official can be a member or associate with any political party or organisation which takes part in politics. An official cannot criticise the government, directly or through documents published anonymously and pseudonymously either.
