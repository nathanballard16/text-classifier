Cops register mobile snatching case one year after the incident

SURAT: An offence of snatching of a mobile phone worth Rs15,000 was registered by cops one year after the incident at Limbayat police station in the city. The offence took place in January 2018 but the offence was registered only on Saturday. Cops are looking for snatching or loot-related applications in their files to find out how many such offences were not registered and why, after receiving instructions from police commissioner Satish Sharma.Like Limbayat, four few month-old offences were registered at Sarthana police station where the applications were pending, but no action taken. “In some pending cases registered at Sarthana police station, complainants did not come to police again when they were called to furnish more details. Police had registered offences after preliminary inquiry,” said a police officer at Sarthana police station.In one of the offences registered, an unidentified man and a woman were booked for snatching a mobile phone of diamond artisan Ashwin Thummar. The complainant was near Sarthana octroi naka on May 10 when his phone was snatched by the couple.“We are checking old cases to verify if habitual offenders were involved in recent snatching and loot cases. We are also investigating cases in which offences were not registered in the past,” said a police officer at Limbayat police station.Satish Sharma has instructed all police stations in the city to register offences in pending complaints related to snatching and loots after sudden rise in them. “There is an alarming rise in snatching and loot cases in the city. Hence, I ordered police to check if there were any pending applications related to these crimes. We are registering offences on such complaints. This will help us mount pressure on the gangs or individuals involved,” Sharma added.
