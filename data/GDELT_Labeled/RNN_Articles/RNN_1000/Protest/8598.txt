Long queues to get water from tube wells can be seen in many places, and some people are putting their life in danger by going into wells to fetch water. Bharatpur district is one such place.

“We have been asking for Chambal project’s water for long. Our girls have to go and bring water daily. Even the outer areas of the city are facing water shortage, but none of our leaders are paying attention”, said Devendra Singh, a resident of Gandhinagar colony.

In the border district of Barmer, Shiv Ramsar and Chaouthan are facing acute water shortage.
