Mumbai: Shiv Sena workers on Friday staged protests outside a theatre in Vashi, located on the outskirts of Mumbai, because the administration had not put any banner or poster of the film on Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray. The movie, titled Thackeray, released on Friday (25 January 2019).

The Shiv Sainiks created ruckus after they found out that no poster of the film has been placed outside the theatre. They also summoned the INOX management. Screening of the first show has been halted because of the ruckus.

Thackeray, written by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and directed by Abhijit Panse, features National Award-winning actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the main lead.

Balasaheb Thackeray, who passed away on November 17, 2012, in Mumbai, is remembered as a firebrand orator and politician.

On Thursday, a controversy erupted after a video came to the fore showing Abhijit Panse, the director of the film Thackeray, leaving angrily the theatre where the movie's premiere was held.

The video also shows Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut likely convincing Panse to stay back. However, Panse refused to budge.

As per sources in the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Panse's party, there was no seat left for its leader to sit despite the fact that he was the director of the film.

"There was no seat left for Panse to sit. Then he was offered a seat in the front row. At least the film's director should get a seat to sit, right?," said an MNS source.

Later, Panse told a news channel: "Let the film get released. I am happy it is gaining popularity...it is a good movie and everyone should see it."
