Follow us on 2019 Lok Sabha Elections: PM Modi's 100 rally blitzkrieg to set grounds for polls

The Bharatiya Janata Party's powerhouse and star campaigner Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold 100 rallies to set tone before the notification of the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, the party sources said today. The prime minister intends to take the Centre's achievements directly to people across the nation, the sources said.

The 100 rallies will be held in 20 states of the country, starting with Punjab's Jalandhar and Gurdaspur on January 3 (Thursday), they said. To fit the 100 rallies in the tight schedule, he is likely to hold more than one rallies in one day, perhaps in more than one state as well.

Apart from Punjab, Prime Minister Modi's January poll calender also includes rallies in Manipur and Assam on January 4; Jharkhand and Odisha on January 5. He is expected to sound the poll bugle in his constituency Varanasi on January 22. He will also visit the Kumbh mela on January 24.
