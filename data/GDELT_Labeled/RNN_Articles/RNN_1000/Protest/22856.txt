AJK PM condemns Indian Army chief’s provocative statement

ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider Khan Thursday termed the Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat recent provocative statement as true reflection of Hindutva and RSS mindset.

In a statement, Rawat had said that the situation at the restive Line of Control (LoC) could escalate any time.

While strongly condemning his irresponsible statement, Prime Minister Farooq Haider said that people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir were standing shoulder to shoulder with their valiant armed forces and ready to respond befittingly to any Indian misadventure from across the LOC.

He said in current scenario, such offensive statements and preparations for escalation along LoC by Indian Army chief appeared to be an effort to divert world attention from widespread protests in India against the Citizenship Amendment Bill.

Raja Farooq Haider Khan added that Kashmir was the first defence line of Pakistan and people of AJK were fully prepared to defend the frontiers of motherland and that in case of any Indian misadventure, the war would be on the other side.

He said that people living forward areas of LoC were brave and courageous. They had no such fear of war. India even couldn’t fight with them rather engaging the valiant Pak Army.

The prime minister said that fascist Modi government, which is desperate for the Hindu supremacy in the region, needs to understand the fact that one could defeat militants, rebel group or terrorists by the use of force but not a nation that strive for freedom jointly without fear of death.

“No power on earth can snatch their destination. Indian general’s offensive statement of increasing escalation along the LoC has pushed the entire region towards instability,” he said.
