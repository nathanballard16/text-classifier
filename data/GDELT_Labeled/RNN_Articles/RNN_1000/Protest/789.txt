Congress stages protest against Vijaya Bank merger

: Congress Thursday staged protests at different venues in the city against the Centres decision to merge Vijaya Bank with Dena Bank and Bank of Baroda.

The main protest was held in front of Vijaya bank regional office here, where former minister Ramanath Rai and J R Lobo, MLC, addressed protestors.

Lobo said the Centre' move to merge the profit-making Vijaya Bank, established in Dakshina Kannada, with two other banks running under loss, was tantamount to betrayal of the people of the region.

Ramanath Rai and district Congress president Harish Kumar also spoke.

Protests were also held at Kankanady and before the Congress party office.
