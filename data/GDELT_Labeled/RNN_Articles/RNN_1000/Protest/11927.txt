Rahul Gandhi criticises Indian forces in occupied Kashmir

National integration isn’t furthered by unilaterally tearing apart J&K, imprisoning elected representatives and violating our Constitution. This nation is made by its people, not plots of land.



This abuse of executive power has grave implications for our national security.
