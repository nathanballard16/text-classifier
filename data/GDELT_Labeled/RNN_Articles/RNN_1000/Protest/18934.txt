Lekhi, Goel protest against AAP over onion price rise

New Delhi, Nov 29 : BJP leaders and Members of Parliament Vijay Goel and Meenakshi Lekhi on Friday staged a protest against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over increasing prices of onion in the national capital.

Blaming the Kejriwal government for the onion price hike in the national capital, Goel said that while people in the capital were already suffering from polluted air and water, Kejriwal is also "not letting them eat".

Kejriwal had said the Centre has stopped onion supply to the Delhi government at a controlled price as onion rates hover over the Rs 100-mark here.

Goel had said on November 23 that the Centre had asked the Delhi government about its requirement of onions, "but the Delhi government did not respond and is now doing politics".
