Teachers to resume protest on January 18

Coimbatore: Members of the Joint Action Committee of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organization-Government Employees’ Organization (Jacto-Geo) would stage a protest on Friday (January 18) to press their demands of withdrawal of complementary pension scheme and settlement of arrear salary for 21 months under the Seventh Pay Commission, among others.

Pointing out that some workers, including those with anganwadis, were not brought under the regular pay scale and they were still under consolidated pay, VM Michaelraj, state information and communication secretary of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers’ Association (TNPGTA), said they should be brought under the regular pay scale at the earliest.

The members’ another demand is to make the pay of post graduate teachers on par with that of central government employees.

Earlier, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court had asked Jacto-Geo to withdraw the strike based on a litigation. While the court had asked the state to provide the details of the action taken on the seven-point charter of demands of Jacto-Geo, the state had not provided it and sought four weeks’ time to do so.

“So, the court had set aside the litigation and now we have decided to protest,” Michaelraj said. Members of Jacto-Geo would stage a protest at the district headquarters on Friday. “After the state-level meet on January 20, we will stage various protests and road rokos from January 22 to 25, to pitch for our demands.” TNN
