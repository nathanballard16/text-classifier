CAA protests HIGHLIGHTS: Clashes between locals and police broke out in Seelampur area in Delhi on Tuesday afternoon during an anti-Citizenship Act protest. The police had to resort to lathicharge and fire tear gas shells at the mob which pelted stones on the cops. Several vehicles were also damaged by the rampaging crowd. Television channels showed roads strewn with bricks and stones. Entry and exit at Seelampur and Gokulpuri metro stations are closed in view of the violence, the DMRC said. Earlier, the Supreme Court refused to make a direct intervention on the alleged police atrocities on persons protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act. A bench headed by CJI SA Bobde directed the petitioners to approach the High Courts with their pleas. On Monday, the petitioners had urged the top court to take suo motu cognisance of police action against Jamia Millia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University students. “We don’t want to spend time knowing facts, you should go to courts below first,” the CJI said. The top court said it, prima facie, does not think court can do much as it is a law and order problem.
