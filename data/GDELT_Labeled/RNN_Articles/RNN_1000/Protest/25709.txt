Maharashtra deputy CM post for Ajit proves Pawar Sr can’t dump him

MUMBAI: Ajit Pawar is back as deputy CM after a gap of barely over a month, this time under the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray . His return to government demonstrates that NCP boss Sharad Pawar cannot dump his nephew, who is popular in the ranks, with quite a few of the party’s MLAs committed to him.On November 28, when Uddhav was sworn in as CM, it was expected that Ajit would be sworn in as his deputy. But Sharad Pawar had then stepped in, saying it was his conscious decision to keep Ajit away from power. Ajit had ‘rebelled’ and got sworn in as Devendra Fadnavis ’s deputy before quitting and returning to the party fold.“No doubt Ajit Pawar’s coup attempt failed, but it has established that he still has clout in NCP. Of course, a majority of NCP legislators are still loyal to Sharad Pawar,” a senior NCP politician said.Senior NCP and Sena leaders felt that since Ajit Pawar has taken over as deputy CM, his administrative skills would be useful for CM Uddhav Thackeray. An NCP politician pointed out that after Ajit returned to the party fold, there were two opinions on his rehabilitation.One view was that since he had joined hands with BJP, he should be made to wait for a while, and the second view was that in view of his clout, he should be forgiven and rehabilitated at the first opportunity.“It was decided that during the first expansion, he should be inducted as dy CM, otherwise NCP would have to pay a heavy price,” he said.
