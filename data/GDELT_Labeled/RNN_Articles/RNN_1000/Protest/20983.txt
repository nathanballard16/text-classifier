Jamia, AMU protest Updates: The police crackdown on students of Jamia Millia Islamia and boiling anger against the amended Citizenship Act fuelled fresh protests in the national capital on Monday with Congress and several other opposition parties rallying behind the agitators.

Thousands of students took to the streets against the alleged police excesses on Jamia students on Sunday evening and over the new legislation, claiming that it will weaken India’s secular foundations and damage its social fabric.

Earlier today, the Delhi police briefed the media on what happened in Jamia on Sunday. Informing about what led to police action, Delhi Police PRO MS Randhawa said that the protest happened around 2 pm in which some locals also participated. “Around 4:30 pm some protesters went towards Mata Mandir marg and resorted to vandalism. They set vehicles on fire…around 30 police personnel received injuries, two SHO suffered fractures, one of our personnel is in ICU,” he said. Speaking on why police entered the Jamia campus without permission, the Delhi Police PRO said: “When we started pushing rowdy elements, they went inside. Police also chased them, stones were being pelted at us. We are doing a detailed investigation.”
