Intellectuals of the country descended in support of Modi government

New Delhi: Amid political protests in the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act, more than a thousand intellectuals of academia, including professors, chancellors, researchers, scientists and jurists belonging to the prestigious institutions of the country have supported this law and it has been implemented in India for centuries. According to the identity of the old 'refugee Vatsal'.

Professor of Political Science, Dr. Swadesh Singh of Delhi University and Prof. Abhinav Prakash spoke to more than 1100 intellectuals in a survey and came to the conclusion in that conversation. Dr. Singh said that, 'A few dozen professors of the country do not represent the well-wisher thinker class of this country. His ideological support of violent protests is a condemnable act. The new Citizenship Act brought by the government represents the country's age-old tradition of being a 'refugee vatsal' in which we have been harboring a perpetually oppressed society. '

These intellectuals have signed a joint memorandum stating that this law satisfies the very old demand of giving refuge and citizenship to people who have come to India after being tortured on religious grounds from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Since the failure of the Liaquat Nehru Accord of 1950, almost all parties with different ideologies, including the Congress and the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), have been demanding the granting of asylum and citizenship in India to religious minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, mostly Dalits.
