Youth Congress to hold Smrithi Yatra

Yatra with ashes of slain activists will begin on March 1

Youth Congress (YC) State president Dean Kuriakose has said that a Smrithi Yatra carrying the ashes of the slain young Congress workers in Kasaragod will be held from March 1 to 5. The yatra will begin from Kasaragod on March 1 and end in Thiruvananthapuram on March 5.

He said Youth Congress workers would protest against the killing of their colleagues on February 25. They would hold protest in front of the offices Superintendents of Police in the State on the day. Mr. Kuriakose was speaking to reporters at a press conference at the Ernakulam Press Club on Saturday. He said that a fund collection would be done in support of the families of the young Congress workers. The Youth Congress leader said he did not question the judicial proceedings against him on the recent hartal in the State. The hartal was called to protest the killings and it was a peaceful one. However, he alleged that the State government had no moral right to be part of the proceedings against him.

He said there were 97 hartals in the State during 2018. Of these, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) alone accounted for 17 hartals. During 2017, the Left Democratic Front accounted for 21 hartals, he said as he called for a public debate on hartals.

Mr. Kuriakose said there was a “conspiracy” against the Youth Congress as it intensified its agitation demanding the arrest of the culprits in the Kasargod killings.
