Jaganmohan Reddy says no NRC in Andhra Pradesh as protests against CAA continue

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has said that his government is not in favour of bringing the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Earlier his party YSRCP had supported the NDA government in passing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Parliament.

After his deputy CM assured the Muslim community in Andhra Pradesh that the Jagan government will not implement NRC in the state, now Jaganmohan Reddy himself has said his government will oppose NRC in all states.

Jaganmohan Reddy was participating in the foundation stone laying ceremony of a steel plant at his home district Kadapa where he was flanked by Deputy CM SB Amzath Basha when he made the remark on Monday.

Jagan attempted to assure minorities in the state that his government will oppose nationwide NRC.

While the Citizenship Act seeks to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the NRC is a list of all genuine Indian citizens who can prove they were or their family was part of the nation before a certain cut off date.

The contentious CAA and NRC have sparked nationwide protests that have turned violent in many places.

While in Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) opposed CAA, both Andhra Pradesh parties, YSR Congress Party and main opposition Telugu Desam Party, supported the legislation.

Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have witnessed massive protests against the citizenship law while Hyderabad too has seen extensive protests over the days since the law was passed.

The fight against the new citizenship law is "not just the issue of Muslims" but concerns all Indians and there should be a sustained struggle against the legislation, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi said late Saturday night at a meeting organised by the United Muslim Action Committee, an umbrella body of various Muslim groups at Darussalam, the headquarters of AIMIM in Hyderabad.
