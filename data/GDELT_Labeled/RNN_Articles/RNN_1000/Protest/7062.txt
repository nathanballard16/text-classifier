TMC of Mamata Banerjee writes letter to EC against Khali campaigning for BJP; claims 'He's not Indian'

TMC (All India Trinamool Congress) led by Mamata Banerjee has themselves allowed Bangladesh actors to campaign in general elections 2019 but couldn't stop themselves to complain against Khali. In a recent report, it is being reported that TMC has registered a complaint against wrestler Khali, also known Dalip Singh Rana to campaigning for BJP candidate Anupam Hazra in Kolkata.

TMC wrote a letter to Election Commission and alleged that Khali did campaigning for Hazra despite that he is an American citizen. "Mr Rana is not an Indian citizen and holds citizenship under the United States of America. Therefore, a foreigner should not be allowed to influence the minds of the Indian electors as he has little or no knowledge as to who should be an appropriate MP in India," letter to the EC reads. They also claimed that BJP is using Khali's celebrity status to misguide Indian voters.

However, the letter doesn't mention how can foreign nationals are campaigning of TMC's own candidates. Bangladeshi actor Ferdous Ahmed recently was seen joining Kanaia Lal Agarwal's rally in Raiganj. While Ghazi Abdul Noor had been part of Saugata Roy's campaigning in Dumdum.

The interesting thing is that the two Bangladeshi actors those did campaigning for TMC actually were found in violation of their visa provisions. While on the other hand, Khali, was born and raised in India, he was also a part of Punjab Police before giving up his job to enter professional wrestling.
