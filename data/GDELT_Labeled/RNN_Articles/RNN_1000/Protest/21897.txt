Citizenship Amendment Act: The students versus the regime

For the moment, the BJP appears to be making the same mistakes as the Congress did during the massive 2012 protests in Delhi after the gang rape of a student on a bus: refusing to talk to young protesters.

Instead Mr Modi has insinuated that Muslims and "people of Pakistani origin" are responsible for the violence.
