This is to mark the council's solidarity with students nationwide, currently facing 'state represssion,' it said.

The University will hold its 27th convocation on December 23.

Puducherry Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, Members of Parliament from Puducherry V Vaithilingam and NGokulakrishnan and the University Vice Chancellor Gurmeet would be among those present at the convocation, a University release said.
