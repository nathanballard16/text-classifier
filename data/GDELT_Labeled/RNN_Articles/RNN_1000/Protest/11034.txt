The roads in these areas have been left with potholes ever since they were dug up byWater Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB). A number of accidents have taken place due to the broken roads, with two wheelers being the most common victims. Demanding better roads and infrastructure, the residents stood outside the BBMP office with placards. BBMP engineers said that by 2020 the entire Horamavu and adjoining areas would be ready by 2020.The 1.2-km stretch of road from Kadugodi Flyover in Whitefield to Belathur Main Road in State Highway-25 is in a mess, say commuters. The ongoing white-topping work combined with the cycle-lane work is causing all the trouble. About 100 people, mostly residents of Golden Blossom Apartment, staged a protest near the apartment complex, from 11.00 am to 11.30 am.Haralur residents came together to reclaim their footpaths.
