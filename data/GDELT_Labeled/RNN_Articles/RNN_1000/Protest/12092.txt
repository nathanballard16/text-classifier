Kerala Nun Who Protested Against Rape Accused Bishop Expelled From Congregation For Her 'Lifestyle'

On August 5 the congregation received the communication from the "Apostolic See" that the dismissal decree had got the needed confirmation. The letter by the Vatican said the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, by virtue of the faculty given to it by Pope Francis, had considered everything seriously.

: A Kerala nun who took part in a protest against former bishop of Jalandhar diocese in connection with a rape case has been expelled by the Franciscan Clarist Congregation for 'failing to give a satisfactory explanation' for her lifestyle "in violation of the proper law of the FCC." Sister Lucy Kalappura had also published poems, purchased a car and taken part in a protest against a rape accused former bishop of Jalandhar dioecese. The congregation, under the Roman Catholic Church, said the nun was issued "proper canonical warnings", but did not show the needed remorse. In its August 5 letter to her, head of the Aluva based congregation, Ann Joseph said "you are hereby dismissed from the Franciscan Clarist congregation as you failed to give a satisfactory explanation for your lifestyle in violation of the proper law of the FCC". The "unanimous decision" to dismiss the nun was taken at the congregation's General Council on May 11 this year. This was sent to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in the Vatican through the Nuntiature in New Delhi.
