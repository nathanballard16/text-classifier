MH-IMMOLATION ATTEMPT

Man tries to set himself on fire in minister's presence

Nagpur, Feb 22 (PTI) A man tried to set himself on

fire during a programme in Maharashtra's Bhandara city Friday

where state energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule was also

present, police said.

His attempt was thwarted, they said.

The man was identified as Arun Bhede (45), reportedly

a BJP worker.

A program to distribute building work kits was

underway at Dasra ground in the city when Bhede suddenly

climbed on the dais and poured kerosene on himself, a police

release said.

Superintendent of Police Vanita Sahu who was on dais

and others immediately snatched away the kerosene bottle and

a matchbox from his hands, the release added.

A video of the incident was posted on social media,

which showed Bhede purportedly saying that he had worked for

the BJP for last 30 years, and he did not want to cause any

disturbance at the event.

Local sources said that Bhede, a former corporator,

wanted the city administration to remove encroachment from the

area surrounding a statue he had got installed. The police did

not confirm this. PTI CLS
