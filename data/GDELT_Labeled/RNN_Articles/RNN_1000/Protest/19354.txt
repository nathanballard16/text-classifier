Agra citizens hold protest march against Hyderabad vet rape-murder

People gathered at the Shaheed Smarak in Agra to protest against the brutal rape and murder of Hyderabad veterinary doctor.



The protestors hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and called the slogan Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao mere words with no real dedication behind them on the government's part.



Women protestors also demanded that a stringent law is formed for the safety of women. The protestors claimed that the BJP has assumed a deathly silence on this issue which is unacceptable.



Meanwhile, talking to India Today, a senior BJP leader said that the law is taking its course in this case and there was no need of making any political statements on this issue.



Former Congress City President Ram Tandon said that the Prime Minister's slogan 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' has turned into 'Beti Marvao aur Raj Karo'.



Participating in a protest candle march, Tandon said that if such rape incidents continue to take place unabated, the time is not far when the people will throw off the Narendra Modi government from power.
