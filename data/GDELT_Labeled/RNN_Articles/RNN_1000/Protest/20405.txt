Congress announces international protests against slump in Indian economy

Congress on Friday announced that it will organise protests against the economic slump in India in eight countries. Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) in a statement said that persons of Indian origin connected to IOC units will conduct demonstrations in front of the Indian embassy/consulates to express their frustration against the steady decline of the Indian economy.

The protests will be part of Congress's Bharat Bachao’ campaign and will coincide with Congress’s rally at Ram Leela Maidan in the national capital on Saturday against farmer distress, unemployment and economic slowdown.

IOC Chairman Sam Pitroda in a statement said that IOC units will be conducting a demonstration in front of the Indian Consulate in New York and Hamburg, Indian High Commissions in London and Dublin. Protest meetings are also planned in Sydney, Oman, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.

Virendra Vashishtha, secretary of IOC told India Today TV that Sam Pitroda is supervising these protests to highlight the growing frustration among India diaspora settled overseas. He said that slump in the Indian economy and falling value to the Rupee is hurting the interests of millions of Indians due to the wrong policies of the Modi Government. "Our demonstrations will be peaceful to send out a meaningful message across," he added.
