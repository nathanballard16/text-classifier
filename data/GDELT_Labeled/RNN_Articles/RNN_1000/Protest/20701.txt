Mannu students attack Modi govt

Hyderabad: The Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu) campus on Saturday reverberated with slogans like “Mere khoon se likh do, mere kafan par likh do Hindustan (write in letters of blood on my shroud, Hindustan)” and “Modi teri tanashahi nahin chlegi (Modi your dictatorship will not work)” as hundreds of students marched in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The students under the aegis of the Manuu Students’ Union took out a torch procession and marched throughout the campus, raising slogans against the Modi government. Addressing the students, union president Umer Farooq said the NDA government led by the BJP was inspired by Islamophobia, which had resulted in its bringing laws which tarnish the secular fabric of the country.

The main purpose of bringing the CAA and other laws was to target a particular community, he said. “With the NRC and the CAA, the Modi government is contemplating to send Muslims and aadiwasi-moolwasi people, who were living here for centuries, to detention centres,” Mr Farooq said.

He said, “We are the followers of Gandhiji, Maulana Azad and Ambedkar, while the ruling party leaders are followers of Savarkar and they want to nurture the Manuwadi agenda. They were slaves of the British rulers and now they have become enslaved of Israel. We will never allow them to divide India on religion basis.” Mr Farooq said the union would address letters to Chief Ministers requesting them to denounce the Centre’s directives on the CAA and the NRC.

He said now the government wsa showing sympathy towards the intruders of stating that they were persecuted in neighbouring countries. He asked whether Akhlaq Ahmed and other persons were not persecuted in

India. “The Modi government is not interested in protect our countrymen,” Mr Farooq said.
