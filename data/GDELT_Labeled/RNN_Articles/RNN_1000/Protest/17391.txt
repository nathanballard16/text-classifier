Police seek justice on the streets

The licences of the lawyers who were part of the Delhi violence should be cancelled and the courts should treat all parties equally, the Central IPS Association said in a resolution on Tuesday.

The remarks came after unprecedented protests by Delhi police personnel on Tuesday outside the police headquarters in the capital for 11 hours against attacks on their colleagues at the Tis Hazari and Saket courts.
