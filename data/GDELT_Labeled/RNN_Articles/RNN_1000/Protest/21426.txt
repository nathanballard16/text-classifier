Truck operators write to CM for police protection in view of agitations

Kolkata: The Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators' Associations (FWBTOA) on Monday sought police protection from the state government, in the wake of ongoing protests against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Bengal. "Today, we have written a letter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to give truck drivers police protection in the disturbed areas. We urge the government to give police protection at the disturbed areas," said Sajal Ghosh, joint secretary of FWBTOA. It might be mentioned that the state government has taken various measures to prevent incidents of violence. She had also urged the agitators not to indulge in road and train blockades and damage of public property.
