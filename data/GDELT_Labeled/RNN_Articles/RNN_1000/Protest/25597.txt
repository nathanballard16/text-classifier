Protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) through kolams continued in the State on Monday, with members of the DMK decorating the outside of their houses with kolams that had anti-CAA messages.

On Sunday, police had detained eight residents, including 5 women for drawing kolams that protested the CAA in Besant Nagar. The residents, members of a platform called 'Citizens Against CAA Group' had gone to different streets in Besant Nagar and requested permission from house owners to draw the kolams in front of their homes. They had been picked up by the police while drawing some. Political leaders had condemned the police action.
