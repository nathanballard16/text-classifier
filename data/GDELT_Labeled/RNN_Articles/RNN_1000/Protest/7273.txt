Cop robbed of pistol

Janakpurdham, May 1

A band of smugglers looted a pistol from a policeman in Musarniya Rural Municipality, Dhanusha, this morning.

A group of 25 liquor smugglers looted the pistol from a police team patrolling the area at around 3:00am. When the patrol team tried to seize liquor being smuggled to India from Nepal, the smugglers clashed with them, and looted a pistol from a policeman.

According to Dhanusha District Police Office, the smugglers looted the pistol from ASI Pramod Kumar Sah.

DSP Rameswor Karki said the pistol had not been recovered yet. Police have taken Sakuntala Devi of Mukhiyapatti Musarniya under control for investigation.

Meanwhile, a police team led by DSP Gyan Mahato has been deployed to nab the absconding smugglers.

According to police, a large quantity of liquor was being smuggled to Madhuwani district, India. Since liquor is banned in Bihar, many groups are actively involved in smuggling liquor to Bihar, especially considering the general election in the state on May 6.
