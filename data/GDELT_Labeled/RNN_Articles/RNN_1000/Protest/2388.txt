Emulate T.N. model, give 69% reservation for MBCs, SCs, STs

Members belonging to various political parties on Tuesday staged a demonstration in front of the Head post office here demanding the Centre to scrap the 10% reservation for the economically poor in jobs and education.

Leading the demonstration, A.M. Salim, secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI), criticised the move and said that it will lead to shrinking of opportunities. The agitators also demanded the Puducherry Government to emulate the Tamil Nadu model and provide 69% reservation for Most Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Representatives of the DMK, CPI and Dravida Kazhagam participated in the protest.
