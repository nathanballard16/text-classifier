Priyanka to work hard to give UP Congress CM: Rahul Gandhi

Amethi: Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said his sister Priyanka Gandhi, appointed General Secretary of the party in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, will now ensure that a Congress Chief Minister gets to rule Uttar Pradesh.

Addressing an event in his parliamentary constituency Amethi, the Gandhi scion said that she will work hard to make sure that the sprawling state gets a Congress administration.

“Aaj maine Priyanka ko UP ka General Secretary bana diya hai. Ab wo yahan par Congress ka apna CM baithane ka kaam karengi,” he said as crowds of party workers cheered.

The Congress leader also said that his party would now fight the battle of Uttar Pradesh with its full might.

Earlier, Gandhi laid the foundation stone of 18 developmental projects on his arrival at Fursatganj in Amethi on a two-day visit.

He was greeted by overzealous party workers at several places. He also met gram panchayat representatives. Posters and banners carrying his and Priyanka’s pictures came up at many places in Amethi.

Celebrations also broke out in many parts of Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

Jubilant Congress activists and supporters took to the streets in Lucknow too, dancing and raising slogans in favour of Priyanka Gandhi.

“Indira is back!” read some posters, an obvious reference to the striking resemblance between Priyanka Gandhi and her late grandmother Indira Gandhi.
