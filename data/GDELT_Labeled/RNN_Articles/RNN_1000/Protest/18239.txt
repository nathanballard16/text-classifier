Gauhati University students threaten to intensify protest against Citizenship bill

The students of Gauhati University on Tuesday threatened to take on roads if the proposed Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is implemented in Assam.



In the evening, the students of the university had burnt the effigy of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to protest against the bill. The students said that they will not accept the bill at any cost.

Saurav Pratim Gogoi a student of Gauhati University - said that if the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is implemented in Assam then it will lead to an undemocratic situation in Assam.

"We, the students of Gauhati University, don’t accept the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. We are telling to the government that this bill should not be implemented in Assam. Otherwise, there will be a huge identity crisis in Assam," Saurav Pratim Gogoi said.

On Monday, the North East Students’ Organisation (NESO) - an umbrella organisation of eight student bodies of the North-Eastern region, held protest marches against the bill across all states in the region.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is likely to be tabled in the winter session of the parliament and is aimed at identifying illegal immigrants in India while granting citizenship to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
