Home Minister Rajnath Singh Wednesday told the Rajya Sabha that the Citizenship Amendment Bill is intended to pave way for Indian citizenship to the persecuted religious minorities from three countries.

He assured the government was committed to preserving the distinct culture and identity of the North East.

The bill seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non- Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan based on some conditions.

The Minister said he was aware of the concerns regarding the bill as well as misconceptions being spread about it but would like to dispel the apprehensions of the people of Assam and the Northeast.

He said it is not only for migrants from these states but to "protect migrants of six minority communities from three nations" and was applicable to the entire country.

Thousands of migrants from Western borders are residing in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and other states and the bill is for them too and would be implemented in all states and UTs, he said.
