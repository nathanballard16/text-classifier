BJP MLAs disrupt LG's address, marshalled out

New Delhi, Feb 22 : Soon after the Delhi Assembly began its Budget Session, three BJP MLAs were on Friday marshalled out of the House for interrupting the welcome address by Lt Governor Anil Baijal.

The MLAs -- Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta, O.P. Sharma and Jagdish Pradhan -- went near the Speaker's podium protesting against the Delhi government's "delay" in sanctioning prosecution in the JNU sedition case, after which Speaker Ram Niwas Goel called the marshalls.

Later, Goel said the LG's address is not a part of proceedings of the House and they could have taken up the issue later.

Gupta shouted that the government was "delaying" the sanction to prosecute the accused in JNU sedition case.

Later, speaking to the media, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the BJP MLAs always create ruckus in the House.

"The issue over which they are shouting, the (police) took three years to file the chargesheet. They even went to the court without following the proper channel. As per law, they should have approached the government before submitting the chargesheet in the court.

"Law gives us three months for taking a decision on any chargesheet."

Sisodia said that instead of questioning the government, the BJP should answer why it took three years for "their police to file the chargesheet".

In January, Delhi Police filed a chargesheet against former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) President Kanhaiya Kumar and others in the sedition case registered in 2016.

The case involves an event organised at the JNU campus in February 2016 against the hanging of Parliament-attack mastermind Afzal Guru. Kanhaiya Kumar has denied the charges against him.

Delhi Police has sought permission from the Delhi government to go ahead with the prosecution.
