Redevelopment of rly colonies opposed

WRMS members taking out a rally in the city on Monday

Vadodara: The Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS) held demonstrations outside offices of railway managers of Mumbai, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Ratlam divisions on Monday to protest the redevelopment of 23 railway colonies.

WRMS alleged that the ministry has taken the decision will cause mass dislocation of families of railwaymen and education of their children will also be hampered. The Railway Land Development Authority will not provide any alternate accommodation, the railwaymen’s body alleged.

The railway colonies of Western Railway that will undergo redevelopment are located at Anand, Khokhra, Rajkot and Bhavnagar in Gujarat, Khar, Bandra, Santacruz, Matunga and Dahisar in Mumbai and at Ratlam. A rally was also taken out in Vadodara to protest the ministry’s decision that railway employees who have completed 30 years of service or 55 years of age should be retired.

“These employees have not even planned and discharged their responsibilities towards the families and prepared for the post-retirement life related to housing and education and marriages of their children,” said general secretary of WRMS J G Mahurkar.
