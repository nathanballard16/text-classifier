Doctors of AIIMS call off their strike

AMN / NEW DELHI

Resident doctors of AIIMS have called off their strike today following the meeting between Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and associations of AIIMS and Safdarjung resident doctors.

The Minister met representatives of resident doctors associations at his residence in New Delhi. Dr Vardhan cleared their doubts and queries related to the National Medical Commission Bill. He reiterated that National Medical Commission Bill is a big change in the field of medical education which will prove to be a blessing in better health services to 130 crore people.

The Resident Doctors Association said that the General Body Meeting of RDA, AIIMS was convened today. The Executive Committee conveyed the decision of withdrawing the strike and resuming of all services by Resident Doctors immediately, provided AIIMS clarifies that strike period will be considered as On Duty.

Doctors had been boycotting work and demonstrating over certain provisions of the Bill after its passage in Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

“Met the delegation of resident doctors association from AIIMS and Safdarjung hospital. Cleared their misconceptions about the NMC bill. I have a full faith that doctors will call off the strike and resume work n the interest of the patients,” Harsh Vardhan said in a tweet.

This was the fourth day that the doctors were on a strike opposing the NMC bill. With Monday being a heavy rush day for OPD, the AIIMS doctors resuming work would be a boon.

The Safdarjung RDA is yet to take a call on whether they would call it off or continue. A meeting at the Indian Medical Association (IMA) is currently underway.
