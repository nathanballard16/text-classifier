SRINAGAR (Web Desk): In occupied Kashmir, an 11th class student has succumbed to pellet injuries he sustained during anti-India demonstrations in Srinagar city.

The student was injured in the pellet firing by Indian troops on demonstrations in Soura area of Srinagar against the repeal of special status of occupied Kashmir by the Indian government. He succumbed to his injuries in a hospital in Srinagar.



Indian forces regularly use shotguns in clashes in Kashmir that fire hundreds of metal pellets at a time, blinding and maiming thousands in recent years.

On August 5, Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government stripped the Kashmir of its autonomy.

Ahead of its shock announcement, India rushed tens of thousands of extra troops to the region to join 500,000 already in the valley, and imposed a strict communications clampdown that remains largely in place.

Kashmir has been the spark for two major wars and countless clashes between the two nuclear-armed arch-rivals.
