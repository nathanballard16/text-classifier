45-year-old man enters techie’s flat drunk, misbehaves; arrested

NOIDA: A man has been arrested for allegedly trying to enter the flat of a 30-year-old woman in a drunken state in Sector 19 on the intervening night of June 8 and 9, police said on Monday.

The victim, a software engineer working with an MNC, alleged that the man, her neighbour, made an "obnoxious remark" at her. Lakshman Singh Khati (45) was nabbed on Monday evening, police said.

“I was on a call in my room when I suddenly heard someone knocking at my door. I kept the phone and went down to open the door. Lakshman was standing there. He was drunk and said he wanted to spend the night with me. I immediately raised an alarm,” she said.

Following this, her landlord and neighbours arrived at the spot. The man then fled. An FIR was registered under IPC Section 354 A (making sexually coloured remarks, shall be guilty of the offence of sexual harassment) at Sector 20 police station. “I have been staying in this locality for the past six years. It is possible that he has been following me," she said. The woman added the accused's family has been pressurising her to withdraw the complaint. “They told me that he did it under the influence of alcohol," she said.

In another incident, a supervisor allegedly indulged in obscene behaviour towards a female sweeper at the DSC road on June 7, police said on Monday. The woman from Sector 49 alleged that the accused held her hand and misbehaved with her. “He left the spot when I resisted. I informed the members of safai karamchari organisation,” she said. The members later held a protest outside Sector 49 police station and demanded that her complaint be lodged. Sector 49 SHO Ajay Aggarwal said a complaint has been received and action will be taken after verifying the same.
