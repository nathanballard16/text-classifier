Kashmiri man beaten up for raising anti-India slogans; detained

Seemed to be under the influence of alcohol, say police

A 28-year-old Kashmiri man was detained on Sunday for allegedly raising anti-India slogans during a protest in Jantar Mantar, the police said.

Abid Hussain who had come to the city from Kashmir on February 16, was beaten up by the public for allegedly raising anti- India slogans, they said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said around 1 p.m., a man started raising anti-India slogans. A group of people had gathered there at that time to pay homage to the CRFP martyrs in the Pulwama terror attack.

On hearing the slogans, they started beating the man, the police added.

“Police personnel deployed at Jantar Mantar rescued him and took him to Parliament Street police station. He has been taken for medical examination. He has been detained and is being interrogated,” said Mr. Verma.

Mr. Hussain appears to be under the influence of alcohol but his medical reports are awaited, the officer said.

Hundreds of people from all walks of life gathered at India Gate and Jantar Mantar on Sunday for candlelight marches to express solidarity with the families of the slain CRPF jawans.

Special deployments

As the protests continued for the third day on Sunday, the police enhanced security in the Capital with special deployments in the protest areas.
