CUTTACK: A 14-judge full bench of the Orissa high court on Monday kept in abeyance contempt proceedings initiated against the president and the secretary of the Orissa High Court Bar Association in view of the association members resuming work on Monday. The high court fixed November 29 as the next date to hear contempt proceedings initiated against 67 other subordinate court bar associations.Normal functioning of the high court resumed on Monday with lawyers returning to court after abstaining from work for 18 days. On October 15, the high court had initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against the presidents and the secretaries of 68 bar associations, including the high court bar association.As part of the proceedings, the 14-judge full bench had issued notices to all the bar associations to show cause as to why steps should not be taken against them for violation of Supreme Court guidelines on strikes by lawyers. The case was taken up on Monday.Association president Gopal Krushna Mohanty told TOI, “We submitted our reply and pointed out that our abstention from court work has been suspended. Taking note of our response, the 14-judge bench headed by chief justice K S Jhaveri kept in abeyance the contempt proceedings as far as the high court bar association is concerned.”The advocates of the high court had been staying away from court work since October 14 to protest against the recommendation by the Supreme Court collegium for appointment of judges to the high court. The lawyers returned to work after the association resolved on Friday to suspend their agitation for the time being.“We resolved to suspend our abstention from work in the interests of the public,” Mohanty said. He said the association had taken into consideration the request of the Bar Council of India and the assurance of Union law minister that he would look into their grievances. In a memorandum to law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , the association had demanded the filling up of vacant posts of judges in the high court by elevation of only legal practitioners in the high court.The full court bench, however, posted the contempt case against the 67 subordinate court bar associations to November 29 for hearing along with their response to the show-cause notices issued to them earlier.The Central Action Committee of All Western Odisha Bar Associations representing 32 bar associations had filed a reply to the show-cause notice stating that their ongoing cease work was for a permanent high court in their region. But the full court expressed dissatisfaction with it and sought a proper reply on the next date of hearing.
