Bangaluru: Taking a stand against the felling of trees, the residents of various societies came together at the Palace Grounds on Sunday. A campaign named #MaraHatyeThadeYojane was launched in order to prevent the constant felling of trees in the area.

More than 300 people made a pledge stating "Trees are the pride of our land. Trees are our life. Without trees, our land is dead. Come let's protect the beloved trees of Bengaluru". The citizens and activists from Bengaluru have taken this pledge under a project which intends to stop tree felling.

Symbolic of the protection of the trees, green ribbons have been tied around them. According to the Bangalore Mirror, the project was started after the people got to know that at least 144 trees were cut between the Hebbal Junction and Meekhri Circle for the construction of the elevated corridor project.

While talking to the Bangalore Mirror, Srinivas Alavalli, the co-founder of Citizens for Bengaluru stated that the yojane has been created in response to the marking to 144 trees on the Bellary Road by KRDCL. The trees have been marked in order to cut them, no environmental impact assessment (EIA) has not been done yet. Since the right procedure has not been followed, the NGT and the High Court have also not sanctioned the project.

Vijay Nishanth, a tree doctor, said that though they are not against the development of the city, they do stand against deforestation. Though the High Court has stated that public consultation is mandatory in cases where more than 50 trees are being cut, most authorities do not feel the need to conform to this.
