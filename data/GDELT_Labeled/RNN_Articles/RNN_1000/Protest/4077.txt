PM’s rally in Chennai on March 6

This will follow one in Kanniyakumari on March 1

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be holding a mega election rally in Chennai on March 6, the second such rally within the span of a week in Tamil Nadu.

He will kick off the BJP’s campaign for the Lok Sabha elections in Kanniyakumari on March 1.

“This mega rally will be a turning point in Tamil Nadu politics. The NDA’s alliance partners will also share the stage with our Prime Minister,” State BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan said.

A BJP spokesperson told The Hindu that the Prime Minister’s events in Kanniyakumari have now been clubbed and he will take part in only one rally where he will also flag off a few projects. Earlier, he was scheduled to take part in two events.

Mr. Modi’s rallies are seen as an attempt to boost the BJP and the NDA’s electoral prospects in the upcoming polls. The BJP sees Tamil Nadu as a crucial State following the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The party has asked the State government to provide a suitable location for the event in Chennai, the spokesperson said. Ms. Soundararajan said the NDA will put forward the schemes of the Central and State governments before the people. She added that the alliance was confident of Vijayakant’s DMDK and the Puthiya Thamizhagam joining the NDA.

“The DMDK will join. Krishnaswamy (Puthiya Thamizhagam) will also join. Both have the welfare of society and the nation’s interest in mind,” she said.
