Students protest outside 'Bigg Boss Telugu 3' host Akkineni Nagarjuna's house questioning his silence on harassment row

Some days back a journalist had alleged that four organizers of the reality Television show 'Bigg Boss Telugu 3' asked her for sexual favours. She has now carried on her protest demanding a ban on the show. In fact IANS even goes on to report that Osmania University students joined her in the protest.

These students protested outside actor Akkineni Nagarjuna's house in order to put a ban on 'Bigg Boss Telugu 3' before it airs. These students even demanded to know the reason behind his silence over the matter raised by the female journalist.

The students, who wondered how an icon like Nagarjuna could host a show which insulted women, tried to barge into his premises in posh Jubilee Hills. Police had to then arrest the students and take action against them by shifting them to Jubliee Hills Police Station.

The show went live on Sunday with the actor. An advocate named K. Jagadishwar Reddy has however filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Telangana High Court, seeking a stay on the show. This PIL is expected to be heard next week.

The victim had previously filed a case against the organizers of the show with Banjara Hills Police station in Hyderabad under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC. Talking to ANI over the phone, she said, "They (organisers) didn't give me any agreement and asked me how I am going to satisfy the boss. They also body shamed me."
