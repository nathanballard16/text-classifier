Intolerance much? On Mother's Day, Priyanka Sharma's mum worries for her arrested daughter's safety

A day after the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) youth wing convenor Priyanka Sharma, her mother alleged she was arrested at TMC's behest because she used to work for BJP.

"My daughter was arrested because she used to work for the BJP. This is all part of a big plot. This is the first time she is far away from us. Had she been a TMC worker nothing bad would have happened to her, this is all done by TMC. The fact that she is in jail has increased our worries," Priyanka's mother told ANI.
