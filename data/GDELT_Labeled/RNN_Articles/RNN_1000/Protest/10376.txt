Senior BJP leaders have been spotted entering Hotel Sofitel in Mumbai on Sunday where several Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs from Karnataka have been holed up since late Saturday night.

The BJP Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) Prasad Lad and BJP leader Mohit Kambhoj were spotted leaving the hotel.

However, both leaders denied that they had anything to do with the developments in Karnataka.

"I have not met any MLA from Karnataka. I am busy with enrolling primary members in the party," Lad told reporters after he was spotted leaving the hotel building.

Kambhoj said he visited the “hotel's spa every Sunday”.

Maharashtra Congress president Ashok Chavan accused the BJP of attempting to topple the democratically elected Congress-JD(S) government in Karnataka and misusing official machinery in the saffron party-ruled states.

Security outside the hotel had been beefed up and people have not been allowed to enter the building premises.

Congress workers gathered outside the hotel to protest against the 'murder of democracy'. Several of them were rounded up by the police and taken to the BKC police station, officials said.

The JD(S)-Congress government in Karnataka plunged into a crisis on Saturday, with 13 MLAs of the alliance submitting their resignation to the speaker.

After putting in their papers, 10 MLAs boarded a chartered flight to Mumbai and arrived at the hotel late Saturday night, sources close to them said.

The JD(S)-Congress coalition’s total strength, including those who have put in their papers, is 118 (Congress-78, JD(S)-37, BSP-1 and Independents-2), besides the speaker.

The BJP has 105 MLAs in the Karnataka House.
