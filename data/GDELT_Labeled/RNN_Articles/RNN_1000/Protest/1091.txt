Supreme Court asks BJP to seek fresh nod from West Bengal govt on 'Rath Yatras'

NEW DELHI: The Bengal BJP unit can hold political meetings in the state in the run-up to the crucial 2019 polls, but its grand plans to hold a series of yatras which would converge in Kolkata received a setback when the Supreme Court asked the party to submit revised plans to the government for its nod.“Looking into the details of the proposed rath yatras and the order of the state dated January 14, 2019, we cannot say that the apprehensions expressed by the state government are totally unfounded,” said a three-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and L Nageswar Rao.The state government had refused to give permission to hold the yatras, prompting the party to move the Calcutta High Court to enforce what it says was its fundamental right to assemble peacefully in a democracy. A single judge had initially allowed them to hold the rallies but a division bench had set it aside.The BJP Bengal unit then moved the top court against the decision. Arguing for the state government on Tuesday, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, assisted by lawyer Amit Bhandari, said the government had already permitted several meetings but the state cannot allow rath yatras which will cut across the state and converge in Kolkata.However, he said that the state was willing to consider giving its nod if the BJP provides the details the state was seeking including how many leaders would be on the dais, who will be addressing it, the time, venue etc. It is the state government’s responsibility to ensure law and order, especially since the state had a high proportion of minorities, and Intelligence inputs had said that there would be law and order issues if these yatras are allowed, he argued.He cited the impending CBSE exams as another hurdle in ensuring law and order. The state cannot allow yatras continuously for 20 days, he said. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the BJP, took umbrage at the state chief secretary’s order which had dubbed the rath yatra “communal”. “Who is he to say that we are communal?”
