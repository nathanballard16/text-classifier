RJD elated by Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s lantern march

Former CM holds march to highlight power crisis in Madhya Pradesh.

Bhopal: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s lantern march organised in Bhopal on Sunday evening to highlight power crisis in the state, has created flutter in Bihar politics. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders on Monday took the opportunity to attack Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar saying that lantern alone can shine Bihar, as demonstrated by Mr Chouhan.

RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav tagged a picture of Mr Chouhan holding a lantern during the march in his Twitter account and posted a comment that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi was saying in Bihar the age of lantern was gone, Mr Chouhan was moving around with a lighted lantern.

“This indicates Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in Bihar is winning (2019 Lok Sabha elections) hands down”, the Twitter post said.

Another RJD leader took to Facebook thanking Mr Chouhan for popularising RJD symbol in Madhya Pradesh, while a party colleague of him wondered if the former MP chief minister and BJP national vice-president has joined the RJD.

Madhya Pradesh, which was a power surplus state till six months ago, is currently witnessing unscheduled power cuts in several parts of the state causing inconvenience particularly to farmers in the state.

Incidentally, MP chief minister Kamal Nath was forced to cast his vote with the help of light of his cell phone following the power cut in the polling booth during the period on April 29.

Mr Chouhan said even Congress candidates have been forced to carry mobile generators while campaigning in their respective constituencies in the ongoing LS polls in the state.
