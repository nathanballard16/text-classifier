New Delhi [India], Dec 15 (ANI): Following the incidents of violence amid protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Sunday decided not to halt trains at four stations on its Magenta line.

"Entry and exit gates of Sukhdev Vihar, Jamia Millia Islamia, Okhla Vihar and Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh are closed. Trains will not be halting at these stations," DMRC's tweet on Sunday read.

Three Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses were set on fire near Bharat Nagar area as demonstrations against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the national capital turned violent.

Huge plumes of smoke were seen billowing out of the buses as flames engulfed them.
