Modi fearful of occupied Kashmir bloodbath once curfew is lifted: PM Imran

75 days & Occupation government of Modi continues the siege in IOJK. Modi is riding a tiger - he thought he could get his agenda of annexation by using 900k forces to silence Kashmiris. You don't need 900k troops to fight terrorism; you need them to terrorise 8m Kashmiri people.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, is fearful of the bloodbath that will follow in Indian Occupied Kashmir once the draconian curfew is lifted in the occupied valley.The premier took to social media - on Kashmir Day - to remind the people that Friday marks 75 days since New Delhi's illegal annexation of the disputed region.Referring to the situation in the occupied region as "the worst violation of human rights", the premier also noted that Modi's use of more than 900,000 armed security personnel is meant to silence and terrorise Kashmiris and not "fight terrorism"."You don't need 900k troops to fight terrorism; you need them to terrorise 8m Kashmiri people," he added.The prime minister added that the Indian premier "knows" that a bloodbath will ensue "the moment the siege" is lifted, as that would be the only way the Indian government can subdue the Kashmiri people.Earlier, PM Imran said that the illegal annexation of occupied Kashmir is part of a wider policy by the right-wing BJP government in India to target Muslims.In a tweet, the prime minister added that the Modi government’s ethnic cleansing of Muslims should send alarm bells ringing across the world.PM Imran has been constantly warning the world of a possible ethnic cleansing of Muslims in occupied Kashmir after India abrogated its special status on August 5.
