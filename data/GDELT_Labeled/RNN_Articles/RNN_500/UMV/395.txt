Pakistan Stops for 30 Minutes to Show Solidarity with Kashmir

“I want all Pakistanis to come out tomorrow at 12noon-12.30pm to show solidarity with the Kashmiri people and send the Kashmiris in IOK a clear message that the entire Pakistani nation stands in solidarity with them and against Indian fascist oppression and the inhumane 24-day curfew,” Prime Minister Khan tweeted.

Khan has been stirring up religious sentiments during speeches this month after the Indian government revoked the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir on 5 August. Imran Khan said that the Modi government is bent upon “cleansing of Muslims” through alleged atrocities and communication restrictions in the state.

“The daily injuring and killing of Kashmiri civilians, including women and children - all part of the ethnic cleansing agenda of the Modi government and its illegal annexation of Kashmir. The plan to change the demography of Kashmir is a war crime under 4th Geneva Convention,” Khan said.

Nevertheless, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday categorically stated that Pakistan has no locus standi and the disputed Kashmir region has 'always' belonged to India.

“I want to ask Pakistan why it always keeps crying over Kashmir when it was never its part,” Singh said at a defence-themed meeting in Ladakh.

Pakistan claims that India has violated several international conventions by abrogating article 370 of the Indian Constitution unilaterally and Prime Minister Khan has vowed to go to any extent to seek justice for Kashmiris.
