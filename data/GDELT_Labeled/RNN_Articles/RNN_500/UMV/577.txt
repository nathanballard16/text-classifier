Activists and Academics, DYFI move Supreme Court against Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019

“The Statement of Objects and Reasons mention that the criterion is undivided, pre-Partition India. Then Afghanistan ought not to have been a part of the list (of target countries). If the criterion is neighbouring nations, then there are a host of countries surrounding India that have witnessed violence upon minorities. The Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar have been subjected to ethnic cleaning and genocide. Sri Lankan Tamils have suffered systematic discrimination and state-sponsored persecution. This classification also fails because though the statement of objects and reasons mentions that Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh have an official state religion (Islam), other neighbour like Sri Lanka also has an official State religion (Theravada Buddhism).”
