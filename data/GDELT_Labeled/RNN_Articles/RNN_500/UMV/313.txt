'Modi's ethnic cleansing of Muslims...': Imran continues with his â€˜Naziâ€™ hysteria over Kashmir

New Delhi:

In what can be called reaction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to nation from the ramparts of Red Fort on Independence Day, his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan took to Twitter to accuse Indian government of executing ethnic cleansing in Jammu and Kashmir. “In IOK, 12 days of curfew, presence of extra troops in an already heavily militarized occupied territory, sending in of RSS goons, complete communication blackout; with the example of Modi's earlier ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Gujarat”, tweeted Imran Khan.

Khan also accused the world fraternity of ‘silently witnessing another Srebrenica-type massacre & ethnic cleansing of Muslims in IOK’. To quote Imran, “Will world silently witness another Srebrenica-type massacre & ethnic cleansing of Muslims in IOK? I want to warn international community if it allows this to happen, it will have severe repercussions & reactions in the Muslim world setting off radicalisation & cycles of violence.”

Earlier, PM Modi in his address said, “In this short span of time, we have taken important steps in every sector. Article 370 and 35A being revoked from Jammu and Kashmir is a step towards realising the dream of Sardar Patel.” Lashing at terrorism and those who harbour it, PM added, “Those who give protection to terrorism and support it must be exposed. Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka also are affected by terrorism. All countries in the world need to come together to fight this menace.”

Moreover, Imran Khan, addressing a special session of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s (PoK) Legislative Assembly in Muzaffarabad on August 14, said that if a war breaks out between Pakistan and India, the world community will be responsible. “The world’s eye is on Kashmir and on Pakistan...I will be the ambassador who raises Kashmir’s voice at every international forum,” he said.

On August 5, India scrapped Article 370 of the Constitution which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir was passed in the Lok Sabha by division of votes with 351 members in support and 72 against it. One member abstained from voting. The House also cleared the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019, by 370 "AYES" and 70 "NO".
