Pak Politicians condemn scrapping of Article 370

Agencies / ISLAMABAD

Pakistani politicians have condemned India’s decision of scrapping controversial Article 370 through a presidential decree. Pak Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said there was a threat of ‘genocide and ethnic cleansing in occupied Kashmir’ after India revoked Article 370. He added that Pakistan would request and appeal to the United Nations, OIC, friendly countries and human rights organisations not to remain silent on the issue.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif termed the move “unacceptable” and an “act of treason” against the United Nations. He also called on the Pakistani leadership to immediately demand an emergency session of the UN Security Council and to consult with China, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other friendly countries.

Pakistan Peoples Party Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also condemned the move and lamented that the atrocities by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir were continuing unabated.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said Pakistan will continue extending moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmiris until they achieve their right to self-determination under the UN Security Council resolutions.

Article 370 of the Indian constitution gives special status to Kashmir. It limits the power of the Indian parliament to impose laws in the state, apart from matters of defence, foreign affairs and communications.
