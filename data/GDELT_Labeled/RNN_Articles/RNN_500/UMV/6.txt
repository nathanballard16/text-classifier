Opinion : Indiaâ€™s BJP uses citizenship bill to stoke polarization and mobilize voters

The bill must also be seen in the context of the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, whose first draft released in July did not include 4 million people living in the state. The list, which has been called by activists one of the biggest exercises in disenfranchisement anywhere, was less anti-immigrant than anti-Muslim and anti-Bengali. If the amended citizenship bill is passed in the upper house of Parliament, non-Muslims who have not made it into the NRC, but have lived in India for more than six years, will qualify for citizenship by naturalization, while Muslims in the same situation will be excluded.
