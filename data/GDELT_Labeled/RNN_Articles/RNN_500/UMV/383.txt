Pakistan, India can handle Kashmir issue on their own: Donald Trump

BIARRITZ, FRANCE (Reuters): US President Donald Trump said on Monday that Pakistan and India could handle the issue of Kashmir on their own.

Speaking during a press conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in France, Trump said, “Pakistan and India can handle the issue on their own, but I am here.”

The US president has previously offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir.

Trump said he spoke to Modi about Kashmir and the Indian premier said he has it under control.

When asked if Modi would like Trump to negotiate over Kashmir, the Indian premier said, “Issues between Pakistan and India are bilateral.”

“I have Prime Minister Imran Khan that Pakistan and India should work together for the welfare of their two countries,” said Modi.

New Delhi on August 5 revoked Article 370 of the Indian Constitution which granted special status to the occupied valley.

Pakistan maintains that New Delhi’s illegal move is an attempt to change the demography of IOK and has made concerted efforts to mobilise diplomatic support for Kashmiris.

With the occupied valley under lockdown for over 21 days and over 4,000 people, mainly political leaders, detained or arrested, Islamabad has been warning the international community of India’s genocidal intent to ethnically cleanse IOK.
