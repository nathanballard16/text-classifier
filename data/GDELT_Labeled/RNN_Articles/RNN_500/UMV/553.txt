Watch: Rationale For Citizenship Amendment Bill Explained In Less Than 3 Minutes By Author Anand Ranganathan

The Lok Sabha, in a late night sitting on Monday (9 December), passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 amidst a vote of 311 in its favour, while 80 opposing it. Total 391 members were present in the Lower House at the time of voting.

The issue has been a heated one with debates going on inside and outside the parliament. At a TV news debates on Times Now, Swarajya Contributor, scientist, and author Dr Anand Ranganath lauded the Bill and bursted the narratives he termed illogical.

Reiterating what Home Minister Amit Shah said during his address on the Bill in the Lok Sabha, Dr Ranganathan said that the Islam is the state religion of Pakistan and Bangladesh, and while Muslims did have a choice of choosing their country during the partition in 1947, Hindus did not get such a liberty as India was not a Hindu nation.

Raising concerns about the rapid decline of minority population in Pakistan and Bangladesh, he said, “In 1951, Muslim population share in India was 9 per cent which has increased to 16 per cent today,” adding that, on the other hand, the Hindu population in West Pakistan (current Pakistan excluding Bangladesh) had declined exponentially from “16 per cent in 1948 to 1.5 per cent today”.

“In Bangladesh (former East Pakistan) they (Hindus) were 23 per cent in 1951, 15 per cent in 1974, and today they are a miserly 8 per cent,” he said.
