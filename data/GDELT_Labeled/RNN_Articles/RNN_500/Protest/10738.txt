Bescom lineman electrocuted while repairing faulty line

Though Sunday was a holiday, Chandrasekhar called up Murali around 10.30 am and asked him to repair a line in Thanisandra.

Bengaluru: A 42-year-old lineman attached to Bescom lost his life due to the negligence of a Bescom engineer while repairing a damaged wire in Thanisandra on Sunday morning.

The deceased, Murali, was a resident of Banaswadi. As Murali's body was taken to Ambedkar Medical College for the postmortem, his family members staged a protest at the hospital alleging Bescom negligence.

The family demanded that the guilty engineer be arrested immediately. Kothanur police registered an FIR against Bescom senior engineer Chandrasekhar and assistant engineer Muniraju.

Murali was working as the lineman for the last 15 years and is survived by his wife and son. Though Sunday was a holiday, Chandrasekhar called up Murali around 10.30 am and asked him to repair a line in Thanisandra.

Murali obliged and reached the spot to find Chandrasekhar and another lineman already at the spot. Still, Murali climbed the pole after the power was completely cut. As he was repairing a damaged wire, power surged through the wire all of a sudden and Murali got electrocuted. Chandrasekhar fled the spot, the police said.

Murali's family members alleged that there was a rift between Murali and Muniraju and the latter intentionally did it. The police who have registered a case are investigating as to how the power was restored when the repair work was still on and if someone had intentionally switched on the power.
