New Delhi, February 2

Delhi Congress president Sheila Dikshit today said the party would ask its East UP general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to address rallies here, considering she could be a “better crowd puller”.

Addressing mediapersons at the party headquarters, she said the Congress would contest all seven parliamentary seats in the city and the process of selecting “winnable” candidates had started. The party candidates will be a mix of old and new faces as well former MLAs.

The assertion by Dikshit comes amid recurring speculation over possibility of an alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party for the Lok Sabha polls.

On the possibility of an alliance with the AAP, she said: “No, it’s over… The party may suffer some loss or gain benefit in the absence of an alliance and the Congress will pay attention to it.” — TNS
