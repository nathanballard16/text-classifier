Agra: Right-wing outfits are usually known to stage protests - which are sometimes violent in nature - and harass young couples in public spaces on February 14 every year, on the occasion of Valentine's Day. However, this year, a right-wing organisation has claimed that it is ready to celebrate Valentine’s Day, albeit with certain conditions.

The Agra unit of the Hindu Kalyan Mahasabha has declared that it will protect and offer monetary benefits to couples "if a Hindu man ties the knot with a Muslim woman on February 14', the Times of India reported. The convenor of the group, Sanjay Jat, said that that decision was a "counter move" by the organisation to "save Hindu girls" from being cheated by men from "other community" who "disguise themselves as Hindu men."

Speaking to the daily, Jat said, "We will not engage in any form of violence, but in fact it's our counter move to save those Hindu girls who are cheated by other community men, as they impersonate themselves as Hindu man by changing their names and wear fake Kalawa (sacred thread band worn by Hindus)".

He added, "The right-wing organisations are always targeted for protecting Hindu girls from falling prey on Valentine's Day. But this year, we have decided to welcome the occasion and will also offer protection and monetary benefits of Rs 51,000 to such couples."

The right-wing outfit further announced that it would also organise weddings for the couples of Valentine's Day near Red Fort in Agra.

Last year, two Hindu outfits - Bharat Sena and Shakti Sena - had staged protests in Coimbatore against the celebration of Valentine's Day as they believed that it was against Indian culture. The 'protestors' had torn and brunt greeting cards on the streets, and the Bharat Sena had also protested outside the district collector's office.
