Naidu meets Kejriwal, Yechury; talks about post-poll alliance

“We welcome not only the TRS but any party which is against the BJP. We are welcoming all such parties to be a part of our grand alliance,” Naidu told reporters.

AS CAMPAIGN for the Lok Sabha elections come to an end, opposition parties on Friday stepped up efforts to forge an anti-BJP front. TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, who has been spearheading the opposition’s unity efforts, met AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal and CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday. He is likely to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi, CPI’s D Raja and other senior opposition leaders on Saturday.

Naidu said the doors of the opposition alliance are open to all, including the TRS, whose president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has been talking about a non-Congress, non-BJP federal front. Naidu discussed post May 23 alliance building possibilities during his meetings with Yechury and Kejriwal.

“We welcome not only the TRS but any party which is against the BJP. We welcome all such parties to be a part of our grand alliance,” Naidu told reporters, when asked whether a Congress-led grand alliance will join hands with the TRS.

Naidu also met with the Election Commission (EC). He said he has requested the poll panel to take note of complaints filed by his party, including against the re-poll ordered in Chandragiri Assembly segment in Andhra Pradesh, and demanding an increase in physical counting of VVPAT slips from the present five random EVMs in each Assembly segment.

Questioning EC’s working style, Naidu said, “I have been the party president for the last 25 years. I have never seen this type of Election Commission.”
