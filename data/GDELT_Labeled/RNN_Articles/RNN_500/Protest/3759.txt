New York [USA], Feb 23 (ANI): More than a hundred US-based Indians protested outside the Pakistan consulate in New York on Friday against the terror attack which was carried out by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) on February 14 in South Kashmir's Pulwama.

Waving the tricolour, protesters raised slogans like "Pakistan Murdabad," "Global terror Pakistan, LeT Pakistan," "9/11 Pakistan," "26/11 Pakistan, Osama bin Laden Pakistan," amongst others.
