Jalandhar, August 12

Punjab will provide legal and financial support for a review petition against Supreme Court’s recent verdict ordering demolition of the Ravidas temple in Delhi's Tughlaqabad, two ministers of the state cabinet said on Monday.

Charanjit Singh Channi, the state’s technical education and industrial training, and employment generation, and Social Security and Development Minister Aruna Chaudhary made the announcement at a press conference they held with Jalandhar Member of Parliament Santokh Singh Chaudhary.

Also at the press briefing were Chabbewal Member of Legislative Assembly Raj Kumar and Jaladhar West MLA Sushil Kumar Rinku, who are part of a five-member committee Punjab’s Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had constituted to meet religious and political representatives of the community to draw up a comprehensive strategy to resolve the issue.

The ministers announced that the state government would also bear expenses to build a new shrine at the same place, and added that the chief minister had already spoken to Union Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri for re-allotment of the same site.

The site of the shrine belongs to the Delhi Development Authority.

The Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the shrine in its recent order, sparking protests from the community across the state.
