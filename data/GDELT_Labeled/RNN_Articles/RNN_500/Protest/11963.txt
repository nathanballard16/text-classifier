BHUBANESWAR, Aug 6 (Reuters) -

* Production at Talcher coal fields in the eastern Indian state of Odisha will resume on Tuesday, a company spokesman said, fourteen days after protests over the death of four miners halted production

* Coal India suffered a revenue loss of 2.56 billion rupees

($36.15 million) and an output loss of 2.52 million tonnes of thermal coal, Dikken Mehra, a spokesman for the company's unit said

* "Hopefully full mining operation will resume from the night shift today," Mehra said.

* A senior executive at the Kaniha plant run by state-controlled NTPC Ltd, said the electricity generator had been incurring a daily loss of 110 million Indian rupees ($1.55 million) due to the output cut, adding four of its six units were shut because of a lack of supplies

* Tapan Chand, chairman of The National Aluminium Company, said the strike being called off was a relief, as the coal stock at his company's plant was running low
