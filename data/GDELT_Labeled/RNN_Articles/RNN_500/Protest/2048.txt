Jeypore lawyers extend their stir for HC bench till Feb 15

Koraput: The District Bar Association (DBA) on Saturday extended its cease work protest till February 15 intensifying its agitation for establishment of a permanent bench of the Odisha High Court in Jeypore.

The lawyers had launched the cease work on December 4, 2018 till January 31, 2019, but as their demand is yet to be fulfilled they have extended their agitation. “Lawyers will not attend to court works in Jeypore and other parts of the district till our demand is fulfilled. If no concrete decision is taken by the state government before February 15, then we will decide our next course of action,” said Biresh Patnaik, president of DBA, Jeypore.

According to the DBA, Jeypore, which is 550 km away from the Orissa high court in Cuttack, fulfils all criteria laid down by the Jaswant Sinha Commission for establishment of a permanent high court bench. On December 18, under the central coordination committee, lawyers observed a bandh in Koraput, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri and Rayagada districts to pressurise the government to meet their demand. “If established at Jeypore, the permanent high court bench will cater to the legal needs of the residents of Nabarangpur, Rayagada and Malkangiri districts, which are over 500 km from Cuttack and over 60% of its residents belong to the below poverty line category,” said Patnaik.

Since 2012 the DBA has been demanding the establishment of a permanent high court bench at Jeypore and on several occasions it has resorted to hunger strikes, rallies, dharna and bandh calls. “Our demand is being deliberately overlooked by the state government,” complained Patnaik.
