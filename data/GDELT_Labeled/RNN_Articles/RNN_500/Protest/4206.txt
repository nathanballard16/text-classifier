Happy to see a baba is UP CM, he has taught us Hanuman's caste: Akhilesh Yadav

Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav fired jibe after jibe on current state CM Yogi Adityanath.

Akhilesh Yadav was in conversation with Rajdeep Sardesai at the India Today Conclave 2019 in New Delhi.

Taking aim at Yogi Adityanath's saintly origins, Akhilesh Yadav said he is happy that Uttar Pradesh's CM is a "baba" and he will win with Yogi's blessings.

He clarified that he is not against Yogi Adityanath nor is the BJP leader his enemy but he can confirm that the Yogi Adityanath government has not done anything in Uttar Pradesh.

"Nobody is our enemy. We are happy that a baba is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. We are learning a lot of things from him" Akhilesh Yadav said.

Akhilesh Yadav said this has provided a learning opportunity to him.

However, the things to be learnt from Yogi Adityanath are not necessarily conventional.

Taking a jibe Akhilesh Yadav said, "We learnt that we should have boondi ka ladoo during the Navaratra. If we have to chase away monkeys, we must chant Hanuman Chalisa. He also taught us Hanuman ji's caste."

The comment was referring to the controversy that brewed around the caste of Lord Hanuman when Yogi Adityanath at a public meeting said that the Hindu deity was a Dalit.

Akhilesh Yadav also accused Yogi Adityanath of disrupting the perfumery industry in Kannauj. He said that the BJP administration had stopped the work of building mandis in many towns in the region. He said the only project the Yogi Adityanath government had worked on was the 500-acre land allotted to yoga guru Ramdev.

The Samajwadi Party chief said the Bharatiya Janata Party will lose because the party hasn't worked on the ground.
