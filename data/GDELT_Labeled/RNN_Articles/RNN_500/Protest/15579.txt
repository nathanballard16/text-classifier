Plot To Eliminate Those Groomed By Rahul Gandhi: Ashok Tanwar Quits Congress Before Haryana Polls

In what might come as a big blow to the Congress weeks ahead of Haryana Assembly elections, its former state unit chief Ashok Tanwar on Saturday resigned from the primary membership of the party, two days after quitting party’s election committees. Soon after extending his resignation to party officials, Tanwar accused his political rivals of “selling tickets” for the upcoming state polls. Tanwar, who is said to be a close aide to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, claimed that there is a conspiracy going on to bring down leaders who were guided by Rahul Gandhi. Announcing his decision to quit on Twitter, Tanwar posted a four-page resignation letter addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in which he said, "The Congress is going through existential crises, not because of its political opponents but because of serious internal contradiction." "I after several months of consideration tender my resignation from the primary membership of the Congress party, which I nurtured from my sweat and blood. My fight is not personal but against the system which is destroying the grand old party," the letter added.
