Protest after Friday prayer turns violent in occupied Kashmir

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Protest in the occupied Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar turned violent on Friday (August 30) with demonstrators clashing with security personnel as tensions escalated in the Himalayan region which was stripped of its autonomy earlier this month.

Hundreds of locals staged a protest march following Friday afternoon prayers against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir on Aug. 5.

Security forces were seen using tear gas shells to disperse the angry demonstrators.

Thousands of paramilitary police are deployed in the streets of Srinagar to quell protests stemming from India’s move to revoke a special status for the territory. Muslim-majority Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.
