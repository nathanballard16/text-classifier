The students urged the anti-CAA protesters to read the Act before forming an opinion

Nearly a 100 of them took part in the procession and called for an end to violence and politicisation of campusesAfter IIT Bombay saw protests against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) recently, a section of students marched on the campus in support of CAA on Tuesday evening. They also called for an end to politics in educational institutes."We welcome the persecuted religious minorities ofand," their banner read."We support CAA because it is's constitutional and cultural responsibility to ensure that persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are accepted in our country," a student who did not wish to be named, told Mirror.The march, which began around 5.30 pm, was attended by about 100 students."We stand against violence and politicisation of campuses in India. And we stand against misinformation regarding CAA. We request protesters to go through the Act and then form an opinion,"Eeti, another student, said.Asked if they meant non-Muslims by "persecuted minorities", Eeti clarified that the Act hasand was not framed on the basis of feelings as only three Islamic neighbouring countries were taken into account."As for other countries, there was no embargo on migration of people from any religion, including Muslims. The Act is not discriminatory and does not go against India's ethos," he said.The students said the support march was limited to CAA as they had not studied the issue of NRC in detail."There is so much agitation against CAA. When I spoke to students who were protesting against the law, I realised they have not studied the Act. They said Indian Muslims will lose citizenship. After reading the Act, I realised that a few popular myths need to be busted," a PhD research scholar said on condition of anonymity.
