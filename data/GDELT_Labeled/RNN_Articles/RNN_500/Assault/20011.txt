Assam BJP MLA praises Hyderabad Police for shooting down rape, murder accused

Assam BJP MLA Shiladitya Dev has praised the Hyderabad police for its strong action against the accused in the gang rape and murder of a young veterinarian in Telangana.



The Hyderabad Police shot dead all the four men accused in the gang rape and murder of a young veterinarian in Telangana



Shiladitya Dev said the Assam police must learn from the Hyderabad police.



"I will appreciate what happened in Hyderabad today because they had raped, killed the 26-year-old girl. A rapist and a killer will have to face the death penalty. These four people were anyway supposed to face it, Shiladitya Dev said.



"Such strong action should be taken against heinous crimes in Assam," added Shiladitya Dev.



"We are facing similar threats from the Bangladeshi Muslims. They are raping our women and there is no justice to those victims. I have got a list of dozens of cases in Assam where the parents of the girls were going from pillar to post seeking justice. Forget about the 'encounter', even police are not showing their loyalty towards the rules of the land and they are not helping the victims of rape and murder, the BJP MLA said.



"It is an example for the entire country," added Shiladitya Dev.



Shiladitya Dev said that Assam should learn some lessons because so many rapes and murder cases happen in Assam and the only way to serve justice is to kill them.
