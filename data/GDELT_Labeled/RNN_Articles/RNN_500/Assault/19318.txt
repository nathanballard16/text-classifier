Gang-rape cum murder of a young lady doctor now in Hyderabad

Dear Editor,

System has not improved even after infamous 16-12 Nirbhaya rape-cum-murder of Delhi with country witnessing again similar episode now in Hyderabad on 28.11.2019 of a young lady doctor Priyanka Reddy whose scooter was reportedly punctured to aim the victim for rape-cum-murder by a group of persons. Self-termed human-right activists avoided having candle-march in New Delhi for obvious reasons.

Telangana minister deserves to be condemned for his statement blaming the victim for not calling police.

Bitter fact is very-very weak system of the country where convicted persons of Nirbhaya-episode were reminded about filing last date of mercy-petition to further delay death-sentence awarded to them after time-consuming long court-battle. Such faulty system assisting convicts in every possible manner is responsible for such increased crimes.

Since main culprit and his associates have been arrested for recent Hyderabad incident, system should be refined immediately so as to finish formality of court-battle at every stage on day-to-day basis to be completed in a time-bound period to ensure final hanging till death say within three years of crime to be gradually reduced to one year. It may be made compulsory to grant mercy only on consent by family-members of the victim.
