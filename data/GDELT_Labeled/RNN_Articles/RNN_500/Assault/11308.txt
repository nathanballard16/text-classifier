As significant a role as the Right to Information Act, 2005 has played in making governance more transparent in India, the pushback has been sizeable as well. For example, too many RTI queries are stonewalled on the grounds that release of the concerned information may endanger national security, personal privacy, etc. Then, delays in appointments to the state information commissions cause rollover delays in RTI responses. But the most pernicious weakening of this anti-corruption tool is by threatening RTI activists, even assaulting them, sometimes fatally.

If the law punishes such threats and assaults and murders with force, that will be an important deterrent. In this context it is welcome that this Saturday a CBI court in Ahmedabad has convicted former BJP MP Dinu Bogha Solanki and six others, including a police constable, for the 2010 murder of Amit Jethwa. Jethwa had been trying to expose illegal mining activities in Gujarat’s protected Gir forest region and also that they involved then MP Solanki, when he was shot dead. Speedier convictions would be more just. Still, as Jethwa’s father says, at least the judgment gives the hope that “goons can be defeated.”
