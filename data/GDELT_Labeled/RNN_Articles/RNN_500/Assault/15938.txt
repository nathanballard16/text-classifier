Police booked 12 more suspects in Kasur rape-cum- murder case

Kasur: Chunian police on Sunday booked 12 more people suspected in the account of rape-cum-murder of three boys. The mutilated corpses of three boys were discovered by the locals from sand dunes near Chunian bypass a week earlier.

The total number of arrests has now risen to 20 and all the suspects belong to Chunian. The police got mobilized after CM Punjab Usman Buzdar called an emergency meeting two days earlier. Moreover, PM Imran Khan also directed the police department to get their hands on the culprit as soon as possible.

The incident has sparked a massive backlash on social media. Furthermore, about 300 indigenous farmers under the banner of Kisan Ittehad staged a protest demonstration near Chunian Sugar Mills against the failure of police to find out the culprits despite the interval of one week of the incident. Tabbasum Pervez led the protesters who were holding placards and banners.

Notably, Police also claimed to have done DNA profiling of over 450 suspects. The suspects had been selected from the neighbourhoods of Ghousiabad, Pir Jahanian, Tambowala and Allahabad bypass on the basis of the census lists that police had collected some days back. The suspects also included close relatives of the victims.

Police found DNA testing a credible mean of investigation since in Zainab’s case some two years back, the main source to reach the perpetrator was the DNA profiling and the culprit was identified out of over 1,200 DNA profiles.

According to police, the tests were being conducted of the suspects falling in the age group of 20 to 40 years. They said the criterion for terming somebody a suspect was the 11 questions that they would ask him, claiming that police did not want to bother the innocent people.

Moreover, investigators have geo-fenced the site from where the bodies were recovered and the place from where the victims were kidnapped.

Coupled with, district Police Officer Zahid Marwat, the head of the joint investigation team, cancelled a press conference on Sunday where he was supposed to share some information about the case due to some confidential reasons.
