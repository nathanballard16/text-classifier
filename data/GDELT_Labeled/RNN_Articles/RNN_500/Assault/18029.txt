HUBBALLI: In a suspected case of honour killing , a Dalit couple was hacked to death at Lakkalakatti village in Gadag district on Wednesday afternoon.Ramesh Madar and Gangamma Lamani, both aged 29, got married four years ago. Gangamma’s parents had opposed the marriage and threatened their daughter not to visit the village. Soon after the wedding, the couple left for Bengaluru to work as construction workers.Trouble began when the couple visited Lakkalakatti village. “On Wednesday morning, Gangamma’s family members picked up a fight with Ramesh. In the afternoon, the accused rushed to the couple’s house and attacked them with a sickle and axe. Ramesh died on the spot and his wife succumbed in the taluk hospital,” an eyewitness said. The couple is survived by two sons.Sources said a meeting with village elders was held six months ago and the couple had agreed not to visit the village again. “At the meeting, Gangamma’s kin insisted that the couple not visit Lakkalakatti. The couple had agreed to the condition, but they returned home a week later,” they added.“Prima facie, it looks like Gangamma’s paternal uncle Shivappa Rathod and her brothers Ravi and Ramesh Rathod attacked the couple. We have detained two persons and are questioning them,” said Srinath Joshi, superintendent of police, Gadag district.“Four years ago, the couple registered their marriage in Badami sub-registrar’s office. They left Lakkalakatti and worked as labourers in Shivamogga and Bengaluru. Gangamma’s family members were reportedly against the marriage,” he added.
