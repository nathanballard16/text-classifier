Ahmedabad: 47 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants rounded up

AHMEDABAD: In view of security concerns for the forthcoming Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath on July 4, special operations group (SOG) of the city police has started rounding up Bangladeshi illegal immigrants. On Sunday, SOG rounded up 47 Bangladeshi illegal immigrants from different areas of the city including Danilimda, BRTS bus stand, from near Chirag Park Society, Naroda Patiya, from near Ambika Bridge in Vatva and from Juna Vadaj.ACP, SOG, B C Solanki said five teams were formed under instructions of the joint commissioner of police, J R Muthaliya, and the anti-terrorism squad as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have the chance of being absconding criminals in their own country, or may have links with terrorist outfits.“The teams rounded up such Bangladeshi immigrants who had sneaked into India through the India - Bangladesh border at West Bengal,” Solanki said.“None of them had proof of being Indian citizens, or valid visas and most confessed that they had come here in search of work. They are mostly involved in petty jobs and also begging,” Solanki added.The backgrounds of the Bangladeshis are being checked to verify whether they are involved in criminal activities, said SOG officials.“In the past, we have found many such Bangladeshi illegal immigrants to have escaped to India after committing serious crimes in Bangladesh. Some arrested earlier also had links with terror outfits,” said an investigator.ACP Solanki said they have initiated legal process to deport the illegal immigrants back to Bangladesh, even though many of them manage to sneak back.“We have come across such Bangladeshi illegal immigrants who have been rounded up more than once clearly indicating that they manage to sneak back into India after deportation,” a senior SOG official said.
