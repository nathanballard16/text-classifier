Violence in more parts of UP; Internet suspended in Bulandshahr

Stone-pelting in various places after police stopp protesters from taking out rallies against citizenship law

The incidents happened after police stopped the protesters from taking out rallies after the Friday prayers were held.

More parts of Uttar Pradesh witnessed violence as anti-citizenship legislation protesters pelted stones at police in Firozabad, Gorakhpur, Bhadohi, Bahraich and Sambhal.

In view of the violence, prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144 have been imposed in the entire state.

Although Lucknow and Aligarh, hotbeds of protest in the state, were largely peaceful after security measures were heightened in the state, news from violence were reported from other places. Protesters took to stone-pelting in various places and police resorted to lathi-charge and tear-gas shells to break up the crowd.

As the violence broke out, Internet services were suspended in Bulandshahr district from 3pm, officials said.

District magistrate Ravindra Kumar said the order has been issued to contain the spread of rumours and misinformation on social media.

'In order to maintain law and order and communal harmony, all mobile internet services are being suspended from 3 pm on December 20 in entire Bulandshahr. Internet-related loop lines and lease lines too shall remain suspended,' he stated in an order.

Mobile internet and text messaging services remained suspended in several districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Lucknow, on Friday in view of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Lucknow, Gorakhpur and Sambhal were hit majorly by the ongoing protests on Thursday too.



Internet services remained suspended in several districts to check spread of rumours.
