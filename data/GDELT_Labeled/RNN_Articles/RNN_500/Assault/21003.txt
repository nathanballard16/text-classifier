Activist Annu Duney detained in Lucknow

Lucknow, Dec 13 : Social activist Annu Dubey was detained here after she reached Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence to seek justice for rape victims.

Dubey reached Adityanath's residence on Thursday and sat on a dharna with a placard that read: "Why am I not safe in my own country?" Dubey was detained after the police saw and asked about her identity.

The activist rose to fame on November 30 when she staged a dharna alone in Delhi to protest against the rape and murder of a young veterinarian in Hyderabad. She was allegedly assaulted by a woman constable there.

She staged another protest outside the Safdarjung Hospital on December 5 when the Unnao rape victim was admitted there with serious burn injuries.
