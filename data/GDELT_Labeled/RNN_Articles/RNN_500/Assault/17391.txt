Two murderers caught by Gujarat ATS

Two murderers, who were the ones seen wearing saffron clothes in the CCTV footage following the killing of Kamlesh Tiwari, have been nabbed by Gujarat ATS. A team led by DIG Himanshu Shukla, ACP BP Rojiya, and ACP BH Chavda of Gujarat ATS have arrested the main murderers of the Hindu Mahasabha leader. The names of the accused are Ashfaqhussain Jakirhussain Shaikh (34) and Moinuddin Khurshid Pathan (27).

The duo was arrested near Shamlaji which falls near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. Sources have also said that the accused had once also fled to Nepal to cover their tracks. However, they always had a plan to return to Surat from Nepal. They had reached Shahjahanpur on Sunday and then were apprehended on Tuesday from Shamlaji. Officials continue to maintain that the accused have no links to any organisations. Officials have also stated that Kamlesh Tiwari's murder was, in fact, a very localised conspiracy which is why they expected a slip up from the accused. "These are not professional killers and they don't have much experience as well. We expected them to return to Gujarat and that is why we had been aggressively trying to locate them. As soon as we found out that they are near Gujarat border, all our teams focused on apprehending them," said Himanshu Shukla, DIG Gujarat ATS.
