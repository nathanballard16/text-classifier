According to the police version of the incidents, Kalua, Nat and Sumit, the youth who was also killed in the firing were part of the mob which turned against the cops after the violence broke out.

Inspector Singh was trying to reason with the crowd which was increasingly becoming hostile.

Even after killing him, the rabbid mob didn't relent and continued to beat him with sticks. They even set fire to a car in which the inspector was being taken to the hospital.
