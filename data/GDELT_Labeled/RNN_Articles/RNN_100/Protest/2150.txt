Acclaimed Manipur filmmaker returns Padma Shri in protest

Acclaimed Manipur filmmaker Aribam Syam Sharma on registered his protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill on Sunday by returning the Padma Shri conferred on him in 2006. This comes just four days after a similar protest when families of 76 of the 855 Assam Movement martyrs returned awards given to them by the Sarbananda Sonowal government in 2016.“When this Bill was passed by Lok Sabha, it gave me tremendous pain ... As a mark of protest, I return my Padma Shri to the government of India,” Aribam told mediapersons at his residence in Imphal . “As an Indian living in a democratic country, I feel it’s about time the voice of the northeast is heard by the Centre... If the bill becomes an Act, the future of the indigenous people of the northeast, especially Manipur, would be bleak,” he said, demanding that the Bill be withdrawn.The 83-year-old filmmaker has never shied away from taking a stand on social and political issues. In 2016, he had written an open letter to then Manipur governor V Shanmuganathan, who had asked the state’s cultural icons to write 100 words about “the meaning of culture”, in exchange for which they could have tea at his residence.
