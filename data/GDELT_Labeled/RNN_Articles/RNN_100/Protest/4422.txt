AirAsia opens technology centre in Bengaluru to drive digital transformation

AirAsia has opened a new technology centre in Bengaluru, affirming its mission to transform into a travel technology company.

Co-located with other major tech companies in what is known as India’s Silicon Valley, the centre will become home to around 35 of AirAsia’s Software Engineering and Technology (AASET) experts, each tasked to design and create custom-built solutions for AirAsia’s airline and digital businesses.

The team will work to streamline the airline’s digital assets such as airasia.com and the AirAsia mobile app, alongside the creation and implementation of new products and enhancements such as the new AI-powered chatbot, AVA, to provide frictionless journeys for passengers.

Aireen Omar, Deputy CEO (Technology and Digital), AirAsia, commented: “India is a source for innovation and cutting-edge technology, and offers us tremendous growth potential when it comes to our mission to develop an all-encompassing travel technology ecosystem. This is why we are so excited to expand our footprint in India with the opening of a new technology centre.

“We look forward to further developing our team of specialist software engineers, analysts and product development teams in the region.”

The opening of the new technology centre is one of many global initiatives AirAsia is exploring to drive its digital transformation. Recently, the airline has implemented a number of new digital features including flight search mapping and voice assistance which provides guests with a more seamless, user-friendly experience on its mobile app.

Sunil Bhaskaran, AirAsia India Managing Director and CEO, said: “The opening of AirAsia’s new technology centre demonstrates the airline’s commitment to building world-class technology right here in India.

“India’s skilled manpower can address the requirements of the global market – at the same time adding value to the Indian ICT industry and helping to strengthen the industry ecosystem.”
