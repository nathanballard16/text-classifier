Niranjan sold Cong to BJD: Itish Pradhan

Bhubaneswar: Even after party’s debacle in the recently concluded simultaneous elections, it appears that voices of dissent will never die down in state Congress.

Raising voice against the Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) president Niranjan Patnaik, National Students Union of India (NSUI) convenor Itish Kumar Pradhan Thursday alleged that the PCC chief had sold the party to ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD).

Addressing the media at Congress Bhawan here, Pradhan said, “The person (indicating Niranjan) who destroyed Congress is now talking about putting the house in order.” He demanded expulsion of Niranjan from the PCC president post.

Alleging that Niranjan thinks Congress is his paternal property, he said, “He is one of the highest tax payers in Odisha. What has he done to strengthen Odisha in the previous years. Rather, he was very much focused on promoting the interests of his own family.”

He questioned Niranjan’s decision to field his son Navajyoti Patnaik as an MP candidate in 2019 elections. “What was his son’s contribution to the party and the state? There were many candidates more eligible than him,” Pradhan added.

“We will definitely oppose him as he has surrendered the party to the BJD. We don’t want a businessman to head the party in Odisha,” the NSUI leader said.

Congress Odisha in-charge, Jitendra Singh said, “If such statements have been made at a press meet, disciplinary action will be taken against the person. It is not NSUI’s job to comment on Congress’ functioning. Besides, the NSUI has not been given the responsibility to review the party’s performance in the 2019 polls.”
