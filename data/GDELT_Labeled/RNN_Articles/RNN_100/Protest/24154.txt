Tata Technologies looking to grow business rapidly at non-captive units: CEO Warren Harris

Mumbai: The Tata Group's Pune headquartered product engineering-focused arm, Tata Technologies now has a fresh management team and is looking to grow business in the coming quarters by improving revenue from non-captive units, targeted acquisitions and with a focus on growing faster than the market according to CEO Warren Harris In a chat with ET the chief executive said that while China continues to be the key market for the company, it is relying on a diversification strategy by focusing aggressively on growth of other non-captive units including India. In the last few years, the company has been reducing its dependence onand JLR , its captive customers by investing in focus geographies like China, UK, North America.“In FY19, we grew our China business by 31%, “non-captive” UK business by 14%, “non-captive” India business by 13% in local currency through strategic wins of EV solutions, education offerings and business from new OEMs/ Tier 1 suppliers. We continue to invest in newer geographies like Vietnam, Nordics and the West Coast as we expand our footprint and acquire new logos,” said Harris.In the last year the company has grown its revenue by 9.3% in local currency to Rs 2942 crore.Speaking on the management changes, he said “We brought in a new CFO, we brought in a new head of delivery, we brought in a new head of HR. All of these individuals have come from organizations that are much bigger than Tata technologies. And so they are playing down a few legs as it were, with a view to helping us accelerate the progress. I think the combination of practicing just very good operational rigor and bringing in the talent that this industry needs I think has really driven the improvements that we've seen in the numbers and we expect that to continue,” he said.“Our plan is to grow at a rate that is better than the market and also to complement our organic activities with some targeted acquisitions,” he added.The company is focusing on building capabilities to meet upcoming requirements for its customers around lightweighting, electric vehicle solutions and smart manufacturing.On the company’s continuing growth focus in China, Harris said that the government’s decision to continuously invest in the development of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and the strength of public-private partnerships in developing solutions for autonomous vehicles has been encouraging.“I think it's highly unlikely that autonomous vehicles are going to develop in a generic way…there's going to have to be a relationship between the municipal governments and the federal government, and the organizations that develop the solutions. The cities that will develop quickest will be the cities that enjoy this partnership – this I think, is being demonstrated in China…The combination of commitment from central government in China, and the investment that's coming in, through tech firms and through OEMs is making for a very exciting environment. And I think for organizations like ourselves, who have the experience that Chinese companies don't necessarily have, I think it makes for a very exciting next 5-10 years.”However, he also continues to remain bullish on India when it comes to future-looking technology products and platforms, he said. “The one thing that India does better than anywhere in the world is to frugally innovate and develop low cost products. And, and I think that once the technology (for autonomous vehicles) is established I think that the productization of that technology is likely to happen in places like India…I think increasingly what you you'll see is those black box solutions (used in cars presently) being disintegrated and it'll be organizations in places like India that will achieve that.”The company is also providing global leadership opportunities to senior talent in India according to the top executive.“When it comes to leadership talent we are increasingly falling back on India and recruiting people for positions in other parts of the world, “ he said.
