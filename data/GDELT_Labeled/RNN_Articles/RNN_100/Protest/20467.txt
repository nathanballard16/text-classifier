Students Demand Suspension Of Two Visiting Professors In Makhanlal Chaturvedi Journalism University

New Delhi:

A day after submitting complaint to their Vice Chancellor, the students of Makhanlal Chaturvedi National University of Journalism and Communication in Bhopal staged a protest against two visiting professors - Dilip Mandal and Mukesh Kumar, alleging that they create a divide among students and discriminate based on their caste. The students posted a memorandum towards the Vice Chancellor as a committee was created to probe the issue. Students will also be part of the committee. The two visiting professors have been barred from entering the University until probe is complete. The committee will give a report within 15 days.

The students alleged that these teachers 'ask castes of students on social media and in class, and misbehave with those who belong to upper castes'.

"It creates caste divide among students. We've demanded their suspension. False statements are being made about our protest," they alleged.

Deependra Baghel, the Registrar of the MCNUJ, said, "I have accepted their demand that they will also be a part of the committee. Dilip Mandal and Mukesh Kumar won't enter the University until probe is completed."

ASP Sanjay Sahu said, "The students had been protesting outside of the Chancellor's Chamber. The registrar additionally chatted in their mind about their particular grievances. They desire disciplinary activity against both teachers."
