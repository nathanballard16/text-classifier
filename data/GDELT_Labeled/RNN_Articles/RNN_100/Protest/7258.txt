Hyderabad: The BJP called for a bandh on Thursday against the government’s attitude in the goof-up in the Intermediate results.

In an open letter to the public, TS BJP president Dr K. Laxman, who went on indefinite strike at the BJP office on Monday and was shifted to NIMS hospital by the cops, urged the support of TS people.

According to sources, cops are planning to take BJP main leaders into preventive custody in the same way they did on Monday when the Opposition leaders called for a bandh.

Meanwhile on Wednesday, BJP workers organised a rally at Ramnagar, Musheerabad, in protest against the “undemocratic arrest” of Dr Laxman.

He has been on a peaceful indefinite hunger strike demanding justice for the Intermediate students on irregularities in results because of gross negligence by the Board/contract agencies that led to above 23 suicides by students.

BJP leader Dr Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy along with C. Prakash Goud, Sunitha, Madhavi, convenor Ram and others participated.

Sudhakar Reddy condemned the arrest of Dr Laxman and lathi charge, and “false” cases on BJP workers during the agitation and demanded a judicial inquiry on the irregularities on Inter results.

Meanwhile JNTUH has postponed all its exams due to the bandh declared by ABVP.
