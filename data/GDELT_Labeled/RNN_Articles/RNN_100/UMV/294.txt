India promises to ease Kashmir curfew as Pakistan accuses New Delhi government of 'ethnic cleansing'

Indian security forces said they had eased a week-long curfew and restrictions on movement in Kashmir ahead of a major Muslim festival on Monday.

The move came as police denied carrying out a violent crackdown against protesters in the region, despite the emergence of footage showing troops firing into a crowd.

Jammu and Kashmir police said on Sunday that “not a single bullet had been fired in the last six days” and called the reports “mischievous and motivated news”. They claimed the protests were small and peaceably broken up.

Earlier the BBC broadcast footage apparently showing officers firing tear gas and live rounds at a crowd of 10,000 protesters after Friday prayers in the city of Srinagar.

The BBC stood by its report, while the New York Times and India Today said its journalists had corroborated the incident.

Jammu and Kashmir has been under a media, internet and phone blackout since Narendra Modi's Indian government revoked the Muslim-majority region's special constitutional status on August 5.

A curfew enforced by thousands of Indian troops has made movement and reporting in the region difficult.

The move has provoked outrage in Pakistan, which has fought two major wars with India over the disputed territory since independence.
