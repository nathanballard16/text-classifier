India may extend deadline for imposing retaliatory tariff on 29 US items by 14 days

India is likely to extend the deadline for imposing retaliatory customs duties on 29 US products, including almond, walnut and pulses, by another 14 days, a source said.

The commerce ministry is expected to recommend to the revenue department, under the finance ministry, to extend the deadline for imposing higher tariffs. The current deadline will end on May 2.

“The ministry will recommend extension of the deadline on retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US by another 14 days,” the source said.

If accepted by the finance ministry, the revenue department would issue a notification to that effect.

The government has already extended this deadline over half a dozen times since June 2018, when it decided to impose these duties in retaliation to a move by the US to impose high customs duties on certain steel and aluminium products.

The issue assumes significance with the US deciding to withdraw export incentives being provided by them to Indian exporters for certain goods under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme. The withdrawal is expected to come into force from May 2.

Domestic exporters are jittery over the US’ decision to withdraw these incentives as they export goods worth $5.6 billion under the GSP programme. About 1,900 items including from chemicals and engineering sectors avail these sops.

Both the sides were holding two-track discussions to increase trade in the short and medium term and identify long-term trade potentials.
