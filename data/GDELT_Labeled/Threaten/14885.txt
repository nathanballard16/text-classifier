Delhi: Cops On Alert After Intelligence Input Of Terror Attacks On Police Stations

New Delhi:

About 200 police stations in Delhi have been put on alert after getting intelligence inputs about possible terror attacks. These inputs indicate that Delhi police stations and police colonies may be targeted via suicide or direct attacks by terrorists. According to these inputs received five days ago, terrorists may use explosive-laden vehicles or enter the police stations on foot. Intelligence agencies have also warned that terrorists may use police or army uniforms during the attacks.

After the inputs from the intelligence agencies, these police stations have been put on alert. Delhi police has issued an advisory for the stations. All police personnel have been asked to stay alert. Every entry and exit is being closely monitored and security at the gates have been beefed up. Vehicles are not being allowed inside without proper identification.

Earlier this month, Delhi Police has earlier sounded an alert after central intelligence agencies sent information that terrorists had reached the city to carry out terror strikes during the festival season.
