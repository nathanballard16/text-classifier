Pakistan on Sunday warned the United Nations that India is pursuing a Hindu supremacist agenda under Narendra Modi's Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-inspired government, reported Radio Pakistan. In a rejoinder to India's response to Prime Minister Imran Khan's powerful speech, Pakistan maintained that New Delhi has been pursuing a policy of state terrorism and the premier's speech exposed India's reality before the world."It is strange that a country that has been engaged in state terrorism for over 30 years has the temerity to accuse others of terrorism.May I remind the Indian delegation that repression of people under occupation amounted to the gravest form of terrorism and should be denounced as such," said Zulqarnain Chheena, a member of Pakistan's mission to the UN.He reiterated Pakistan's stance that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is carrying forward the RSS agenda, saying that the killers of Mahatma Gandhi were ruining the secular face of India with their actions at home and in occupied Kashmir.Chheena said the world had applauded PM Imran for revealing the brutalities faced by the people of Kashmir."When my prime minister spoke here yesterday, he put a spotlight on what the Indian government is desperately trying to hide from the world.India neither wants to face the truth of its policies nor does it want others to see it," he added.Referring to India's response to PM Imran's speech, the diplomat said, "What we heard in response was deception and an attempt to divert attention from the ugly ground realities. We are not surprised."He added that the Indian representative failed to mention the lockdown in the occupied territory or the plight of the innocent Kashmiris."53 days without information on the well-being of family and friends, 53 days of total darkness and abiding fear of the unknown."
