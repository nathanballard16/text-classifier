Students gather support for CAA protest on Dec 19

For the second consecutive day on Tuesday, while some students at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, continued to boycott classes to mark their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and students in other institutes were busy garnering support for the upcoming nation-wide protest on Thursday.

“The atrocities haven’t ended against our fellow students in other universities and to make matters worse, network logjam has suppressed voices as well. We are gearing up for a larger and more powerful protest this week,” said a TISS student.

After a series of silent protests at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B), students now plan to assemble on campus on Wednesday and demonstrate against CAA.

“There’ll be a sit-in protest on campus where important texts from the Constitution will be read. We want to make our people more aware. We will also spread awareness about the nation-wide protest on December 19,” said a student representative for the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle (APPSC), in IIT-B.

College students from across the city are planning to gather at August Kranti Maidan on Thursday as a part of a nation-wide protest against the Act.
