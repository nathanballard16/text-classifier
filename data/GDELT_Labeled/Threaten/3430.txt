Centre bans J&K’s Jamaat-e-Islami under UAPA

Crackdown on Jamaat-e-Islami as organisation gets banned in J&K

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday declared J&K-based Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) as an ‘unlawful association’ under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, saying it was in close touch with terrorist outfits, supporting secession and terrorist groups fighting for it and indulging in subversive activities.The ban — which will be valid for five years — comes days after several leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami in J&K, including its chief Abdul Hamid Fayaz, were detained as part of a crackdown by J&K police in coordination with central agencies. Sources said the detained leaders will be formally arrested now that the JeI stands banned.The Centre while notifying the ban said if unlawful activities of JeI were not curbed immediately, it was likely to escalate its subversive activities including attempt to carve out an Islamic State out of the territory of Union of India by destabilising the government established by law.This is not the first time that Jamaat, known for its pro-Pakistan stance, is being proscribed. It was banned in 1975 as part of a general crackdown during Emergency. It had then strongly opposed the Indira-Abdullah Accord and called it a gross violation of UN resolutions on the Kashmir issue. Thereafter, it was banned by the then V P Singh government in 1990, only for the ban to be lifted by the P V Narasimha Rao government in 1993. It has since had a free run.JeI is responsible for transforming the movement for autonomy and self-determination for Kashmir into a campaign for its integration with Pakistan. It was instrumental in changing the character of the struggle and perpetrating Islamic reformism.Jamaat had last contested elections in alliance with a few other religious organisations, including Muslim United Front, in 1987. One of MUF leaders was Mohammad Yousuf Shah, then the group’s Srinagar head. He later joined Hizbul Mujahideen as its supreme commander and is today better known as Syed Salahuddin.Thursday’s notification banning JeI under Section 3 of the UAPA said it was supporting extremism and militancy in J&K and elsewhere, supporting claims for secession of a part of the Indian territory from the Union and supporting terrorist and separatist groups fighting for this purpose, and was involved in anti-national and subversive activities intended to cause disaffection.The Centre said if unlawful activities of JeI were not curbed immediately, it was likely to escalate its subversive activities, continue advocating the secession of J&K from the Union of India, propagate anti-national and separatist sentiments prejudicial to the integrity and security of the country, and escalate secessionist movements, support militancy and incite violence in the country.
