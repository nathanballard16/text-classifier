‘Civil-military ties complex in Muslim world’

Lack of transparency, frail democratic systems and frequent military interventions in the governance systems, are some of the issues plaguing most of the countries in the Muslim world, said scholars, who had converged in Turkish metropolis of Istanbul.

Organized by the Centre for Islam and Global Affairs (CIGA), some 20 scholars who debated civil-military relations across the globe, stressed upon the need to understand the essence of political systems and local realities in the Middle East and the North Africa.

“Militaries are at the center of the decision making,” said Rachid Tlemcani, professor at the University of Algiers in Algeria.

Turkey's anti-terror operation rightful: Experts Pakistani security and political experts said Turkey's counter-terrorism operation in northern Syria would ensure durable regional peace and security."Turkey's operation to secure its borders is justified. Like any other sovereign country, Ankara is within its right to secure its people and borders," Ikram Sehgal, a Karachi-based defense and security analyst, told Anadolu Agency."No sovereign country can allow terrorists to operate on its borders, and pose a permanent threat to its security," he said.Video: Orthodox Jews in US support Turkish Peace Spring OperationTurkey launched Operation Peace Spring on Oct. 9 to eliminate terrorists from northern Syria in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees, and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.Ankara wants to clear northern Syria east of the Euphrates River of the terrorist PKK and its Syrian offshoot, the PYD/YPG.Turkey has said the PKK terrorist group and its extension the YPG/PYD constitute the biggest threat to Syria’s future, jeopardizing the country’s territorial integrity and unitary structure.Ankara has also stressed that supporting terrorists under the pretext of fighting Daesh is unacceptable.Turkey remands four trying to recruit children for PKKIn its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S., and the European Union -- has been responsible for deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants.Terming the refugee influx into Turkey and subsequently to Europe due to terrorists' presence in broad swathes of northern Syria, Sehgal said that a successful operation in the region would pave the way for safe and early repatriation of over 1.5 million refugees to their homes."It [elimination of terrorists] will ultimately benefit the whole region, including Syria, Turkey and Europe," he added.US has to work with Turkey on their terms, says expertHailing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's assurance that the territorial sovereignty of Syria will be fully respected, Sehgal said he hoped that the Operation Peace Spring would be culminated as soon as possible achieving the desired results.Retired Brig. Said Nazir Mohammad, an Islamabad-based defense analyst, voiced a similar view."Turkey is facing the brunt of refugees as the EU is not accepting them," Nazir noted adding that Ankara has been facing a threat from PKK, that's why it wants to create a safe zone along with its border to ensure the safe return of refugees.YPG/PKK terror attacks kill six civilians in SyriaThe safe zone near Turkey border, he said, was actually created by the UN, but was being challenged by Daesh, Syrian Army, al-Qaeda affiliates and a moderate Kurd opposition."Since YPG is a terrorist outfit and being supported by the U.S and Israel, Turkey is worried of the Balkanization of Syria with a Kurd state to be carved out along eastern and southeastern borders," he said suggesting that Pakistan should operate in a gray area of diplomacy and for a peaceful settlement with an aim to respect the territorial integrity of all states."The Turkish operation blatantly exposes U.S. hypocrisy where it was allied with the YPG," said Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow covering the Middle East at Islamabad-based Institute of Strategic Studies.PKK continues to be Europe's favorite terror groupShe added that the Turkish Operation Peace Spring exposed the ''faultiness between President [Donald] Trump and Pentagon where they keep contradicting each other.''"We saw this in the Qatar-Gulf crisis as well," she said.Syed Fakhar Kakakhel, another Islamabad-based political analyst, said: ''It is obvious that Turkey is the one, which is close to the war theater and the most affected by terror attacks.''"Turkey knows much better than the rest of the world how to deal with Syrian crisis," Kakakhel told Anadolu Agency adding that Pakistan itself has faced the brunt of Afghan war for decades.In that perspective, he said, Ankara had every right to move for its own and the region’s security and stability.'Turkey's Syria operation is clearing away terrorists'EU not planning economic sanctions on Turkey: Berlin

He said militaries in the region have a strong relationship with external players, in terms of buying arms and then to seek support to fight people, when they hit streets.

“It is now time to develop a new approach. We cannot understand situation in our societies with [western] traditional approaches and concepts of political science. The new theory should reflect the complexity of the local realities,” he emphasized.

He stressed that governments in Muslim countries need to evolve a system to take everybody on board in the decision-making process, rather than vesting powers in a single entity or a small group. He recommended to introduce democracy and decision-making process at the levels of village and towns, to organize people to take decisions on their day to day issues.

'Turkey's Syria operation is clearing away terrorists' Turkey’s anti-terror operation in northern Syria continues to accomplish its goal of clearing the region of terrorists, said a senior Turkish official on Tuesday."Operation Peace Spring continues in line with its purpose. I think the operation will be completed in a short time in accordance with its objectives," said Turkish Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop in Belgrade, Serbia’s capital, after meeting with Russian Federation Council Chair Valentina Matviyenko."Turkey defends Syria's territorial integrity and is making efforts for it," he added.Schools suspended in north Syria amid PKK/YPG shellingUS trained SDF for possible Turkish operation: reportAsked by Russian journalists if U.S. sanctions would deter the operation, Sentop said they would not."This operation has a purpose and will continue in line with this aim. We have been taking our actions and considering these possibilities. Sanctions will [only] strengthen our country," said Sentop.Matviyenko, for her part, said that Russia supports Turkey's fight against terrorism."Nobody can say that Turkey is not fighting terrorism,” she said.“Those who come from thousands of kilometers away cannot know the dynamics of the region," she added.She also criticized a French proposal at the current 141st Assembly of Inter-parliamentary Union in Belgrade to demand an end to the operation.Sentop is also attending the assembly.Suicide car bombing in Afghanistan kills two soldiersTurkey neutralizes 637 YPG/PKK terrorists in Syria

EU not planning economic sanctions on Turkey: Berlin The EU is not planning any economic sanctions on Turkey at the moment, a senior German diplomat said on Tuesday.Briefing reporters ahead of an EU leaders summit this week, the senior diplomat said the leaders would discuss Turkey’s ongoing anti-terrorist operation in Syria, together with other major EU and international topics, during their two-day summit beginning on Thursday.“The EU has made no plans so far to impose economic sanctions on Turkey,” he said, but stressed that the member states oppose Turkey’s military action and are closely watching developments.'Turkey's Syria operation is clearing away terrorists'EU not planning economic sanctions on Turkey: BerlinEU foreign ministers on Monday spoke of limiting arms exports to Turkey, expressing worries over a humanitarian crisis and instability in the region.

Urging militaries to focus on external threat and protect borders, rather than interfering in politics, Tlemcani said the region will remain dependent on foreign partners for development and protection of national security, if military does not return to barracks.

Case of Pakistan

Debating the case of Pakistan, scholars said both military and politicians in the country have used one another to further their interests. “From Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to Nawaz Sharif, most of the prime ministers used the shoulders of military to come to power, but once they consolidated power, they began confrontation rather evolving and strengthening systems,“ said scholars.

Ejaz Hussain, who teaches at Iqra University in Pakistan, said the military became a principal actor in 1960s in his country. He said before that civil bureaucracy had become a powerful force. Maintaining that Pakistan had a “defective democracy”, he said the country’s systems have not evolved since its inception in 1947.

US trained SDF for possible Turkish operation: report U.S. forces trained the SDF, a rebranded version of the YPG terror group, for a possible operation by Turkish forces in northeastern Syria, Foreign Policy magazine reported Tuesday.Citing a U.S. Army officer who worked with the group, the magazine said the SDF was taught sophisticated battlefield tactics, including how to build a network of tunnels beneath key towns in northeast Syria as a contingency against a Turkish military campaign.The officer told Foreign Policy that the group started to work on tunnels after Turkey seized Afrin, Syria in 2018.Video: Orthodox Jews in US support Turkish Peace Spring OperationThe officer also said U.S. troops conducted several rehearsals with the SDF on how to coordinate in case of a Turkish operation as well as training to build a "defense in depth," a military strategy that seeks to cause a delay to an attacking force.A former U.S. Army officer who also worked with the SDF confirmed the "group built tunnels as a contingency" against Turkey, said the report.It added that the tunnels and other defenses were likely set up as part of preparations for an eventual U.S. withdrawal.Turkey remands four trying to recruit children for PKKYPG/PKK terror attacks kill six civilians in SyriaTurkey launched Operation Peace Spring on Oct. 9 to eliminate terrorists from northern Syria in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.Ankara wants to clear northern Syria east of the Euphrates of the terrorist PKK and its Syrian offshoot, the PYD/YPG.PKK continues to be Europe's favorite terror groupIn its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union -- has been responsible for deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children and infants.Since 2016, Turkey has conducted two major military operations in northwestern Syria -- Operation Euphrates Shield and Operation Olive Branch -- to eradicate threats from Daesh and the YPG, which is the Syrian branch of the PKK terrorist group.Turkey remands four trying to recruit children for PKKTurkey's anti-terror operation rightful: Experts

Turkey neutralizes 637 YPG/PKK terrorists in Syria As Turkey's anti-terror operation in northern Syria continues with great success, the number of "neutralized" YPG/PKK terrorists has climbed to 637, according to the country's National Defense Ministry.The announcement came via the ministry's official Twitter account.Turkish authorities often use the word "neutralized" in their statements to imply that the terrorists in question either surrendered or were killed or captured.Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring on Oct. 9 to eliminate terrorists from northern Syria in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees, and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.Ankara wants to clear northern Syria east of the Euphrates River of the terrorist PKK and its Syrian offshoot, the PYD/YPG.Turkey has said the PKK and the YPG/PYD constitute the biggest threats to Syria’s future, jeopardizing the country’s territorial integrity and unitary structure.Turkey remands four trying to recruit children for PKKTurkey's anti-terror operation rightful: Experts

“There is very little discussion on civil-military relations in Pakistan. The actors in Pakistani politics, in particular, the civil bureaucracy and the politicians, rely on and invoke the instrumentality of democracy. They use democracy as a tool to manipulate in terms of electoral weightage to enter parliament and then they never use democratic means and use power to promote their political or commercial interests,” he said.

The scholar said that Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah had imagined a country with strong political foundations. “He did not like military and civil bureaucracy to intervene in political system,” said Hussain.

“Threat from India has been invoked by both civilian and military leadership, which historically is fact of life. But has been used by stake holders to put impediments towards democratization or otherwise,” he said.

Supporting his argument, he said the most powerful political leader Bhutto was curtailing the role of army during his tenure in 1970s. But at the same time imposed an authoritarian rule to control political elements in Balochistan. “Bhutto used all authoritarian means to stay in power,” he said.
