(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 11/03/2019.)SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government has cautioned all magistrate-level officials, especially those posted in south Kashmir and border areas not to receive phone calls from unknown numbers.The suspected callers identify themselves as senior Army and Intelligence officials seeking critical security and administrative details of the particular area. The government was alerted after at least two magistrates in south Kashmir received phone calls earlier this month from unknown numbers seeking critical details. The officials, not sensing any foul play, gave out the details of the work they were doing and other assignments and projects going on in their areas. However, the surveillance teams from the security establishment were alerted after witnessing a series of calls coming in from across the border through various calling platforms.“One of the officials was asked about the deployment of personnel in the area, security arrangement for VIPs and other ongoing projects and assignments. He gave all the details on phone,” a senior administrative official, privy to the matter told ET. The administration later called all tahsildars and naib tahsildars of various areas and directed them not to receive any calls or give out any information.Many of them have now switched off their official mobile numbers.These call phishing attacks have increased especially after the recent escalation of tension between India and Pakistan “Another official from the same area was called and he also gave details, not knowing who actually was on the other side of the phone,” another senior official in the administration told ET. The unknown callers, sources said, were also enquiring about the implementation of the recent ban on Jamaat-e-Islami and how many people have been arrested and the assets ceased till now. However, none of the officials confirmed the attack, saying that the orders have been issued verbally. Last month, J&K police in Jammu’s frontier Rajouri district issued an advisory warning local residents and officials against receiving such calls.
