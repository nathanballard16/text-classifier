Punjab: Fearing life threat, jailed ‘gangster’ moves court

CHANDIGARH: Alleged gangster Jagdeep Singh alias Jaggu Bhagwanpuria , who is lodged in Patiala jail, on Wednesday approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, expressing fear that he may be killed in a fake encounter or inside the jail. He has also sought directions to shift him to the Amritsar jail as he is facing a large number of criminal cases in that district.Bhagwanpuria also denied having any links with any political leader of Punjab, claiming he was being made a scapegoat following a political rivalry between Punjab jail minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia.In his petition, Bhagwanpuria has submitted that Majithia was trying to get an FIR registered against Randhawa in the murder case of Gurdaspur district SAD leader Dalbir Singh Dhilwan. “In the process, the petitioner was being portrayed as Randhawa’s henchman. The petitioner has also been accused of issuing death threats to Majithia as a part of the malicious propaganda,” his counsel submitted before the HC.His counsel submitted that Bhagwanpuria had threat to his life from certain Punjab Police officials who, for some reasons and political gains, were trying to threaten him. He also submitted that efforts were being made by Patiala jail officials to kill him in a fake encounter as he was given an opportunity to scale the wall of Patiala Jail so that it could be shown that he tried to flee. He also claimed that he was being beaten up inside Patiala jail by officials and even his security during transit from Patiala to Amritsar has been reduced.The petition would now come up for hearing on January 21, 2020.
