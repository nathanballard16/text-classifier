MISA detainees threaten protest against state government on January 10

Those who are found to be fraudulent should stop receiving the pension, but not all should be devoid of it,” Gopal Mishra , president of Loktantra Senani Sangh said. But putting the pension on hold is not correct. INDORE: Maintenance of Internal Security ( MISA ) detainees of Indore on Monday threatened to stage protest on January 10 against the state government for putting their pension on hold till all the detainees were ‘verified’.Indore wing of Loktantra Senani Sangh declared this on Monday and said that they will submit a memorandum to the governor of the state.There are around 160 MISA detainees in Indore and 40 widows of detainees whose pension has been put on hold from February.“If the government wants to verify each detainee, we do not have a problem with it. We feel that the verification process is a farce and that it is just one of the method by Congress government to take revenge against us,” Mishra added.The protesters will sit on a day-long protest outside the Indore divisional commissioner’s office on January 10. Mishra also claimed that they had approached the collector to raise their grievance, however, since the collector was unavailable, they spoke to SDM and communicated the same.“We were told that no official communication had been made to them regarding carrying out verification, which might take a very long time.
