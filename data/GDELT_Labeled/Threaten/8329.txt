Bizmen threaten PSPCL with protests

Ludhiana: City businessmen are up in arms against Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for erratic power supply and frequent power cuts in industrial areas. Industrialists have also warned PSPCL that they will resort to protests against the department if the problem is not resolved soon.

A delegation of businessmen led by president of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JSMA) Jaswinder Thukral met PSPCL chief engineer DPS Grewal at his office on Tuesday evening and complained about the situation. Giving more information, Thukral said, “Undeclared power cuts in industrial area, specially Janta Nagar, are making a very negative impact on our businesses. Every day five to six-hour long power cuts are being witnessed due to which more than 15,000 factories under Janta Nagar Power Division alone are suffering losses in production. On one side, we are already on the backfoot due to shortage of labour and increase in rate of raw material, power cuts are further hitting the industry.”

Thukral also added, “If PSPCL fails to control the situation and power cuts do not stop, we will be forced to take the path of agitation against the department and officials will be responsible for any consequences arising out of the situation thereafter.”

Meanwhile, assuring the businessmen of resolution of the problem, chief engineer said the power cuts during the past few days were caused due to some fault in the lines of 66KV Lalton Kalan feeder which has ben repaired by PSPCL staff and from now on there will be no undeclared power cuts. He also assured the businessmen that the problem in the transformer of the Janta Nagar Power Division has been resolved as well and there will be no interruption in the power supply in the area and industries will be able to run smoothly.
