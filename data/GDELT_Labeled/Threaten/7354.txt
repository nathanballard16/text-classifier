Mumbai: Drunk policeman strips off in front of women, arrested

A 41-year-old police constable who stripped off in front of ladies at Nehru Nagar police officers quarters in a drunk state has been arrested by the police. The accused, identified as Harishchandra Lahane, is the head constable with Pant Nagar police station and was arrested on Saturday night.

The residents of the police quarters have also alleged that Lahane after removing his clothes flashed the women sitting in the balcony while abusing them.

According to the police, Lahane has been serving at the police force for a while and was on unauthorized leave without informing his seniors for the last four months.

"For the past four months, Lahane was at home, grogged up. He frequently used to abuse girls in his vicinity due to which women in the colony were all terrified of him. When the senior officers of Pant Nagar police station asked him to mend his ways, he did not pay any heed. The officers also warned him of strict action against him, but it all went in vain," said a senior police officer, adding the reason behind Lahane being on unauthorized leave is unknown.

On Saturday night, Lahane after getting drunk came out in the lawn and stripped off in front of a group of women who were standing the balcony. The residents called the police control room after which a police team took him away.

"We have registered a case under section 354 (A), 354 (D) and 509 of the Indian Penal Code. We shall ensure that Lahane faces a strict action including job suspension. At present, Lahane is in police custody. After a proper investigation into the matter, further action shall be initiated," the officer added.

A similar incident was reported on Sunday in Mulund where a man was arrested by the Navghar police for flashing a woman inside an ATM booth. The victim took to Twitter to reach out to the police by posting a 19-second video of the man who was in an undressed state.
