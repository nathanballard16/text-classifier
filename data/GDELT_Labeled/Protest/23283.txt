Odisha: Amid anti-CAA protests, SPs asked to remain vigilant

BHUBANESWAR: Alarmed by violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across the country, the Odisha Police have issued an advisory to superintendents of police (SP)s asking them to remain alert.Inspectors general of police (IG)s and deputy inspectors general of police (DIG)s in range areas of the state police have also been asked to remain vigilant.“We circulated the advisory from the state police headquarters to SPs in the districts and range IGs/DIGs a few days ago,” director general of police Abhay said without divulging the contents of the advisory.Significantly, several minority groups, civil society organisations and student organisations have been holding rallies to protest against CAA in different parts of the state, including Bhubaneswar, for the past few days. However, no unpleasant scenes were reported or prohibitory orders imposed anywhere. On Friday, a pro-CAA rally was also organised by a group of people in Bhubaneswar.Additional director general of police (law and order) R P Koche said anti-CAA rallies have so far been extremely peaceful in Odisha. “We have advised SPs to remain alert and take adequate precautions to avoid any untoward incident. We have not come across any violence anywhere in the state,” Koche said.Protests against the #CitizenshipAmendmentAct at various places in the state including Balangir, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Rourkela and Puri went off peacefully owing to proactive steps by the district SPs and range DIGs/IGs, tweeted Odisha Police from its official twitter handle (@odisha_police) on Friday evening.In the advisory, the state police headquarters has asked the SPs to take steps to prevent the circulation of hate and communally sensitive rumours on social media and punish the troublemakers. Sources said SPs have been asked to identify communally-sensitive areas in their districts and take preventive measures to maintain peace and harmony.Police headquarters said some districts like Cuttack , Balasore, Bhadrak, Sambalpur and Kendrapada have been specifically asked to remain vigilant as some sensitive pockets in those districts had witnessed communal tensions in the past.“We have asked the SPs to strengthen their intelligence networks and keep tabs on miscreants, who had fanned communal tensions in the past. Police stations should take all communities into confidence and hold regular interaction with them. Police stations should promptly respond to intelligence input and take action against those, who fuel communal imbalance,” another police officer said. The student wing of Congress also took out an anti-CAA rally in Bhubaneswar.
