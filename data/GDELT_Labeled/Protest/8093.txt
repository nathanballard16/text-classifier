Ludhiana: Accusing congress workers of thrashing party worker Raju Kwatra and his son Anmol Kwatra, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) workers staged a protest at Shivpuri chowk and blocked traffic on the Ludhiana-Jalandhar highway for over two hours on Sunday evening.

During the protest, MLA Simarjit Singh Bains also reached the spot and demanded action against the accused and refused to call of the protest till an FIR is lodging in the matter.

Soon, heavy police force led by additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-1) Gurpreet Singh Sikand reached the spot to pacify the agitators. During the protest, heavy traffic jam was witnessed along the national highway.

Anmol, who is also a social activist, alleged that Congress workers including Manpreet Grewal and Mohit Rampal opened attack on his father in Shivpuri area when he was passing through their stall. “When I got to know about the attack, I rushed there. The accused thrashed me too before fleeing form the spot,” said LIP party worker’s son.

Following this incident, Kwatra with his supporters blocked Shivpuri chowk.

On the other hand, Congress worker Mohit Rampal refuted the allegations stating that Kwatra nursed rivalry against him. When he was crossing by their stall, Kwatra started abusing him for no reason, and when he objected, Kwatra hurled chairs at him and called his son Anmol there as well.

The protest which started at 6pm continued till 8.30pm. The protest was called off when the police asked the father-son duo to give their statements for the FIR.

Commissioner of police Sukhchain Singh Gill said the police have detained two accused in this case. However, an FIR is yet to be registered in the case.
