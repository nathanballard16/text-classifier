BJP Mahila Morcha protests against atrocities on women in Bengal

Kolkata, March 8 : The West Bengal BJP's Mahila Morcha (women's wing) on Friday took out a rally here on the occasion of International Women's Day protesting against the rise in atrocities against women under the Mamata Banerjee government.

The rally led by the party's state women's wing chief, Locket Chatterjee, was held from the state BJP headquarters in central Kolkata to north Kolkata's Shyambazar.

The rallyists held posters and placards demanding progress and empowerment of women and shouted slogans against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for not taking action against offenders.

Accusing the Trinamool Congress government of failing to curb incidents of violence and atrocities against women in Bengal, BJP said it is a matter of shame that the state tops the charts in various categories like women trafficking and women suicide despite the Chief Minister being a woman.

"It is a matter of shame that despite the state having a woman Chief Minister, there has been a sharp increase in the number of incidents of rape and atrocities against women. For 3-4 consecutive years, the state has topped the charts in the number of incidents of rape," Chatterjee said.

Taking a dig at the ruling Trinamool Congress for holding a women's day rally, she said those who are silent on atrocities against women do not deserve to hold such rallies.

"All the mothers and sisters in Bengal should come out and protest against the attack on women here. Those who do not protest against atrocities on women and keep mum on issues like triple talaq, do not deserve to hold rallies on this day," she added.
