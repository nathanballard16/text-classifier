Congress workers on Friday staged a protest outside BK Hospital here, where the body of Congress leader Vikas Chaudhary, who was shot dead, is kept.

While carrying placards condemning the Congress spokesperson's murder, the protesters chanted slogans demanding justice.

Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala and other leaders condemned the killing and attacked the Khattar government, alleging that there is a complete failure of law and order in the state.
