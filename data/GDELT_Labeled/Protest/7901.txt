People will bring down Mamata Banerjee from power for 'fanning violence': Shiv Sena

Accusing West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of fanning violence in the state, Shiv Sena on Thursday said that people will bring her down from power the way CPI(M) was removed from office.

"She did not permit senior leaders to step into the state. What kind of oppressive behaviour is this? She has turned West Bengal into a battleground by fanning violence," Saamna, a mouthpiece of Shiv Sena, said in an editorial.

"There has never been a time when she has not opposed Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath. Earlier, Communist Party of India (Marxist) fanned violence in the state and people threw them out of the power. Now it is Mamata's turn," it said.

Clashes broke out on May 14 in Kolkata during BJP president Shah's roadshow and a bust of the 19th-century social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was vandalised in a college named after him.

Commenting on Banerjee's remark if Shah is a god that no one can protest against him, Saamna said, "She, too, is not Goddess Durga herself. Such violence is dangerous for the country."

On May 14, Banerjee had said, "What does Amit Shah think of himself? Is he above everything? Is he God that no one can protest against him?"

Voting for nine seats in West Bengal will be held in the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha election on May 19.

Counting of votes will take place on May 23.
