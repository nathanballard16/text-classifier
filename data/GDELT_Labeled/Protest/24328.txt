CAA protest: Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi stopped from entering Meerut

Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were stopped from entering Meerut of India’s Uttar Pradesh by the police Tuesday, reports The Indian Express.

They were on their way to meet families of those killed in violence that broke out during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is leading a protest march from Swami Vivekanada statue at Bidhan Sarani in north Kolkata to Gandhi Bhawan in Beleghata.

On the other hand, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will lead a pro-CAA rally in West Bengal’s Siliguri.

Earlier in the day, protesting students blocked the convoy of Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at Jadavpur University where he had arrived for a convocation ceremony.

Amid growing opposition against the amended citizenship law, the Union cabinet is scheduled to meet in the national capital, news agency ANI reported.

Even as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attempted to allay fears on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens, protests against the Act continue to increase since the passage of the legislation.

Protesters have argued that the Act is unconstitutional in that it proposes religious classification.
