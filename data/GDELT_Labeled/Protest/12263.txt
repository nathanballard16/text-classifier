Alka Lamba protests outside CM residence

Rebel AAP MLA alleged Kejriwal stopped installation of CCTV cameras in her constituency

Rebel Aam Aadmi Party MLA Alka Lamba on Saturday protested outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence stating that the latter has stopped the installation of CCTV cameras in her Assembly constituency.

Protest in 2016

She said she was among the AAP leaders who had earlier gone to protest outside Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal’s residence for installation of the CCTV cameras in 2016.

“It was told that there will be a benefit if we install cameras close to the election. On July 14, 2019, one camera was installed in Chandni Chowk but since then, there has not been any installation. A girl was raped and when asked, it was said that the Chief Minister has stopped the installation of CCTV cameras here,” she said.

She alleged that this has been done so that people turn against her. “If voices from my constituency are being muzzled, then let me remind that Delhi elections are not far away,” she said.
