Curfew, communication blackout continues in Occupied Kashmir

In occupied Kashmir, curfew and communication blackout continues on fourth consecutive day, today.

Despite strict curfew and heavy deployment of the troops, people took to the streets in Srinagar, Pulwama, Baramulla and other parts of the territory to protest against the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A by India.

The UK-based news agency, Reuters, quoting police confirmed that the Indian forces’ personnel fired teargas shells and pellets on protesters in Srinagar.

The BBC, citing locals, reported that the Kashmiris are in a state of shock and panic.

Meanwhile, the communication of the entire Kashmiri population with the outside world remains suspended as the Indian government continues to shut television channels and snap telephone and internet links in a bid to prevent protests.
