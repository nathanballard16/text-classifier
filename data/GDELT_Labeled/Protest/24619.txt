Anti-CAA stir: Protest outside Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO

Amid the ongoing agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, people gathered at the Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO late on Friday evening to protest against the police.

This comes after 36 people, including eight police personnel, were injured during clashes over the citizenship law in New Delhi on Friday. They were later admitted to Lok Nayak hospital for treatment.

"Thirty six injured people, including eight policemen, have come for treatment at Lok Nayak hospital. One protester has got his leg injured and will be shifted to the ward," Dr Kishore Singh, Medical Superintendent, Lok Nayak Hospital, told ANI.

Anti-CAA protests were carried out in different parts of the national capital on Friday.

Delhi Police detained around 40 persons and said strict action would be taken against those who have been found involved in the "violence and arson."

While the protesters were being pushed back, a private car parked at Subhash Marg, Daryaganj, was set ablaze.

The police staff immediately doused the fire using water and handy fire extinguishers," read a statement from Delhi Police.

"Some police personnel including senior officers were injured in stone-pelting. Around 40 persons have been detained. Strict legal action will be taken against those who have been found involved in the violence and arson," the statement added.

Protests have erupted across the country against the newly-enacted Citizenship Act, which grants Indian citizenship to Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi refugees fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, and who came to India on or before December 31, 2014.
