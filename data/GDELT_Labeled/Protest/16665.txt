Ahead of Parliament's winter session, Congress plans protest against Centre over economic slowdown

Ahead of Parliament's winter session, which is scheduled to begin from November 18, Congress is planning to hit the streets against the Modi government over the issue of economic slowdown in the country. The party also said that it will ask other opposition leaders to join the protest.

According to a senior leader, the demonstrations will be held in the first week of November. During this period, a big protest rally is planned in Delhi in which Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi are expected to take part.

The leader also added that the date and format of the protest are yet to be decided and information will be sent to the state units soon.

Last month, at a meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), it was announced that the party would hold a countrywide protest from 15 to 25 October on the issue of economic slowdown. However, the plan was postponed due to the festival dates and the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. The party didn't make any official announcement on the delay.

Congress complains that the wrong policies of the Modi government have led to recession and the government is refusing to even talk about it. The party has held several press conferences on the economic issue. Congress had also highlighted the current state of the economy as a major issue in the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had earlier said that 'all-round mismanagement' by the Modi government has caused an economic slowdown.

"The Modi government's policies are resulting in massive job-less growth. More than 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers," Singh had said.
