Education isn’t charity: Kanhaiya, Umar join JNU protest

A+ A-New Delhi: Former JNU students and activists Umar Khalid and CPI Leader Kanhaiya Kumar and Yogendra Yadav, the founder of Swaraj Abhiyan also joined the march taken out by the people in Delhi on Saturday, 23 November, in support of the students’ protest against the hostel fee hike in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). They were demanding to make education affordable for all. Starting from Mandi House the protestors marched towards the Parliament. Students’ groups, teachers, activists and workers of Rashtriya Janata Dal and Dalit group Bhim Army participated in the march. Why is it okay when the money is spent on statues but considered as wasted when it’s spent on education?”
