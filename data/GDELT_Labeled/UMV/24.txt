Kashmir issue must be resolved in accordance with the UN resolutions:

Syed Faiz Naqshbandi (Hurriyat Leader):

Kashmir dispute should be resolved in accordance with United Nations resolutions. Indian troops are committing Muslim genocide in held valley. Massive massacre by Indian troops exposes Indian brutal face in front of international community. Despite of using force and lethal weapons, Indian government has failed to suppress the indigenous freedom movement led by the people of Kashmir. India must stop committing worst human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir. It is responsibility of the world to resolve Kashmir issue according to the will of the people of Kashmir.
