Minister writes letter to UN Special Procedures mandate-holders on HR violations in IOK

Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari has written a detailed letter to 18 UN Special Procedures mandate-holders informing them about the violations of International Human Rights laws being committed by India in Occupied Kashmir.

In her letter, she drew the attention of the UN Special Rapporteurs to the grave human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.

She wrote that human rights violations include denial of right to self-determination, gender-based violence as a weapon of war, communications shutdown, imposition of curfew, arbitrary arrests, child abuse and religious persecution.

The Minister expressed her concern over the violations and threat of further gross violations of human rights alongside of ethnic cleansing and genocide.

Dr Shireen Mazari urged the UN Special Procedures mechanisms to intervene to stop the violations of International Human Rights laws in Indian Occupied Kashmir, in accordance with their respective mandates.

She urged them to pressurize India to reverse its illegal annexation of Jammu and Kashmir, end the communications shutdown and ensure compliance with its international human rights obligations.
