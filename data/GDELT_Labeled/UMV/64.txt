India, Myanmar Wipe Out Insurgent Camps Near Vital Connectivity Project - Media

Amid a series of meetings between the armed forces of the two countries to chalk out a plan and launch a coordinated operation, Sputnik earlier reported that at least two additional Indian Army units were deployed to the Indo-Myanmar border in southern Mizoram's Lawngtlai district to aid the Myanmar Army, which had already started operations against the AA.

Assam Tribune reported that the Indian construction workers engaged in the implementation of the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project were feeling threatened by the possibility of the AA insurgents posing a serious threat to the project.

Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project aims to establish a multi-modal sea, river and road transport corridor for the shipment of cargo from the eastern ports of India to Myanmar through Sittwe Port and vice-versa. The project would encourage investment and trade and also open alternate routes for connectivity to India's north-east region. India is all set to take over the operations of Myanmar's Sittwe Port, which is part of Kaladan project, later this year.
