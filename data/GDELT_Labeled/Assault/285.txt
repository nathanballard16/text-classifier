Man sets wife on fire

Rescued by neighbour; husband flees

A 32-year-old woman survived critical burns after she was set ablaze by her husband on January 5 over domestic discord. The woman was rushed to the district hospital in Noida and later shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi where she was reported out of danger. The police have not registered a case as there was no complaint lodged.

According to the police, Teeja (32), from Mahoba district, lived with her husband Binda and three kids in a small room in Sector Delta-2 in Surajpur of Greater Noida. The couple worked as construction workers at nearby sites in Greater Noida.

The incident occurred at 5.30 p.m. when Binda allegedly poured kerosene oil on Teeja and set her on fire and allegedly fled the spot. One of their neighbours, who heard the woman screaming, reached out to rescue her and the children.

“We received information at 6 p.m. by the victim’s neighbour Raju Sharma. Sharma had already rushed the woman to Sharda Hospital from where she was immediately sent to the district hospital in Noida,” said Surajpur Station House Officer Munish Chauhan.

Mr. Chauhan further added that the neighbour informed that the couple was having an argument over something for quite a long time after suddenly he heard the woman screaming for help. “He saved the woman by calling an ambulance on time. However, the woman was unstable till late at night when the doctors at district hospital shifted her to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi where she was reported out of danger on Sunday morning,” said Mr. Chauhan.
