New Delhi: The Gurugram Police on Tuesday, May 28, ruled out any hate crime angle in the incident where a Muslim man was allegedly attacked for wearing a traditional skull cap while he was returning home after offering prayers at a mosque in Sadar Bazaar area of the district.

Gurugram Police Commissioner Muhammad Akil termed the incident as another torture case, saying, "It is a criminal incident which has no religion. Also, there was no mention of slogans like 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' and 'Jai Sri Ram'. So far no fringe group has claimed responsibility for the attack."

This is contradictory to the victim's claim who had claimed that he was thrashed by five to six men and was made to chant 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'. In a video of the victim that went viral on social media, the victim had alleged that the accused abused him saying that nobody was allowed to wear a skullcap in the area and one of them slapped him.

The case was dubbed as another hate crime and gained traction after newly-elected BJP MP from East Delhi Gautam Gambhir expressed his anguish over the incident and demanded "exemplary action".

"In Gurugram, Muslim man told to remove skullcap, chant Jai Shri Ram. It is deplorable. Exemplary action needed by Gurugram authorities. We are a secular nation where @Javedakhtarjadu writes "O Palan Haare, Nirgun aur Nyaare" and Rakeysh Om Mehra gave us the song "Arziyan" in Delhi 6,” Gambhir had said in a tweet.

The Gurugram case drew more ire of the public owning to the fact that it came just a few days after three Muslims, including a woman, were beaten up in Madhya Pradesh.
