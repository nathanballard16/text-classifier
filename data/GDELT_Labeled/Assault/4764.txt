'Entitled' Gold Coast cook who raped colleague, 20, in his car is set to be deported back to India

A cook who raped his female coworker after offering to take her home after work will be deported back to India.

Gurmeet Singh pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his coworker, 20, in Southport District Court on the Gold Coast on Tuesday.

Singh offered to take the victim home after work but stopped the car to have a drink at The Spit, which separates Southport Broadwater and the Pacific Ocean.

He then kissed her in the car before climbing on top of her, holding her hands down, pulling her pants off and sexually assaulting her, Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

The victim refused to give a statement as she was traumatised and didn't want to relive the assault.

Judge Katherine McGinness sentenced Singh to 18 months' jail which was suspended as he will remain in immigration detention before being returned to India within weeks.

Crown prosecutor Stephanie Gallagher said: 'It really is despicable conduct which demonstrates that he thinks he is entitled to take what he wants despite her protests.'

'She would have had concerns she was about to be raped,' Ms Gallagher said.

Singh's barrister, Nick McGhee said the attack was 'out of character' and his fiancee, who supported him, is yet to decide if she was going to follow him to India.
