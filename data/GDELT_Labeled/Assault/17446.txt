Mysuru police get HC notice on actor Sadhu Kokila’s plea

Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday ordered a notice to Saraswathipuram police in Mysuru following a petition filed by the popular Kannada actor, music composer and director Sadhu Kokila.

The actor, a well-known comedian in Sandalwood, approached the HC seeking directions to quash the criminal case against him following a case filed by a woman.

The Saraswathipuram police had registered the case against Sadhu Kokila under Sec 354 of the IPC, which is assault or criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty.

The victim was rescued from Like Trend Family Saloon, a spa in Mysuru.

The police had raided the spa and busted a prostitution racket. The complainant, who was under the shelter of Odanadi, an NGO, had accused two Kannada actors Sadhu Kokila and Mandya Ramesh of misusing her for sexual favours.
