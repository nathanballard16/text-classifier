Maharashtra: CRPF jawan alleges assault by policemen; cops deny charge

"However, we were stopped by a couple of police personnel who used intimidating and arrogant language," he added. Ingawale, who went to the police station with the other two on a two wheeler and in his uniform, claimed he showed his identity card to the police personnel and offered to pay the fine for triple riding, but they did not listen to him.

PUNE: A 28-year-old CRPF jawan alleged that he was "assaulted" and "handcuffed" by police personnel in Baramati taluka here on Sunday without any provocation when he went to invite them for a condolence meet for the 40 CRPF soldiers who were killed in the Pulwama terror attack. However, a senior police officer strongly refuted the allegations levelled by the jawan, Ashok Ingawale, a resident of Songaon village, who is currently on leave. The officer in turn alleged that it was Ingawale who got into a brawl with the policemen. The incident took place at Pune's Baramati rural police station. Talking to PTI, Ingawale, who claims to be posted in Jammu and Kashmir, said he was part of a small 'mandal' (community group) in his village and it was decided to hold a condolence meeting for the slain CRPF soldiers during a Shiv Jayanti programme on Tuesday. "On Sunday afternoon, I, along with my cousin, who recently retired from the Indian Army, and one more youth, went to invite the senior officers of the Baramati police station for the February 19 programme," he said.
