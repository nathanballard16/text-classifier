MUMBAI: The Nalasopara woman who was arrested for allegedly stabbing her husband to death in their home on Wednesday told the police that she did so because she was upset with her husband since he did not want to have another child.

Pranali Kadam (33) and her husband had two daughters. Pranali claimed that while she wanted a son, her husband did not want to have more children. Earlier, she had told the police that she was upset with him as he was having an affair with someone at his workplace. Before that, she had claimed that he had inflicted the stab wounds on himself. The police, doubting her statements, questioned her further.

Pranali stabbed her husband, Sunil (36), eleven times with a kitchen knife in their bedroom in their Nalasopara (E) flat around 5.30am on Wednesday.
