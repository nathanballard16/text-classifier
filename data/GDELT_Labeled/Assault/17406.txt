Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who was accused of raping a nun at a Kerala convent, will be facing trial at a Kerala court starting November 11.

The court has summoned Bishop Franco Mulakkal of the Jalandhar diocese to take part in the trial procedure. Charges against the Bishop will be read out to him in court.

Meanwhile, the nun who accused Bishop Franco of rape has raised a complaint against him with the state women's commission saying he is now causing her mental harassment.

In the complaint, the sister has alleged that Bishop Franco and his men are using social media platforms to defame her and the group of nuns who started a protest against him.

In the complaint it has also been alleged that "in some videos on YouTube, the photographs of the victim is used, which will reveal the identity".

"The videos are intended to disrespect, abuse, intimidate and influence the witness, victim and the investigation team. This is a violation of the bail conditions laid down by the Kerala HC," said the complaint lodged by the nun.

Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by a nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.

The Bishop was later released on bail.
