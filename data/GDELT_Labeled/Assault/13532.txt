Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar charged with rape under sections of POCSO in Unnao case

A Delhi court has framed rape charges under sections of POCSO against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case.

District Judge Dharmesh Sharma of the Tees Hazari court also framed charges against Sengar's accomplice Shashi Singh for allegedly kidnapping the minor girl.

Charges have been framed against Kuldeep Singh Sengar under IPC Sections 120 b (criminal conspiracy), 363 (kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping or inducing a woman to compel for marriage), 376 (rape) and sections 3 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Supreme Court had recently transferred the Unnao rape case to Delhi and the Tees Hazari court is now holding daily hearings. There are five related cases against Sengar and others in the Unnao rape-accident incident.

The 19-year-old rape survivor was 17 years old when she faced assault at the hands of the BJP MLA and his accomplices.

A few weeks ago, she met with a severe road accident when the car she was travelling in was hit by a truck on a highway near Rae Bareli. She is battling for life after being critically injured in the accident and is now undergoing treatment at AIIMS.

The rape survivor's father died in police custody a year after the rape. In the July 28 car accident, two of her relatives died on the spot while she was critically injured.

The CBI, which has taken over the investigation, has booked 10 people for murder, including Sengar, who is already in jail.

Supreme Court has asked CBI to complete investigation into all 5 cases within 45 days.

The CBI had on Thursday told the court that Sengar and his brother assaulted the father of the girl and framed him in an Arms Act case, in collusion with three state police officials and five others.
