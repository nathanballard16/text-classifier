Composer and harpist to perform, speak about healing from abuse through music

Harpist and composer Jessica Browning will perform a concert on Feb. 5 at Dickinson College.

Her performance will also include discussion about her experience as a survivor of childhood sexual assault, and how she found music to be a tool for healing.

Browning’s uncle, Tim Hurley, assaulted her at the age of 10. He was convicted in 2006 in Cumberland County, and has served time in prison in Somerset.

Browning, who currently resides in France, has taken both her music and her story on tour to Australia, New Zealand, India and Europe, in the hopes of helping survivors process and heal.

The concert will begin at 7 p.m. in Rubendall Recital Hall in the Weiss Center for the Arts at Dickinson. The performance is free, and light refreshments will be served. For more information, visit Dickinson’s website.
