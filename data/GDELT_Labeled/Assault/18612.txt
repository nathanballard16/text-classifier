The petitioner had in his plea in September, submitted that he has been in prison since 16 August 1991 and has completed actual imprisonment of more than 28 years. During this period, he said, he had not utilised the emergency or ordinary leave provided to him under Tamil Nadu Suspension of Sentence Rules, 1982 despite his good conduct in the prison.

Payas and six other people, Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan, S Jayakumar and Nalini, are serving life term in connection with the assassination of Gandhi by a suicide bomber at an election rally in Tamil Nadu on 21 May 1991.
