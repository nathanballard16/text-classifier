New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday settled a long debated question and gave the power to women who have been driven out of their matrimonial homes due to initiate criminal proceedings from the place where she currently resided.

The harassed woman can now file a criminal case against her estranged spouse and in-laws from the place where she has taken shelter after being left homeless by her kin.

The landmark decision was given by a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi in relation to the territorial jurisdiction of the place where she currently resided in after she had left the husband’s house after facing physical and mental harassment in the want of dowry.

The apex court bench also added that apart from the place where a woman was living before and after marriage, the place of her current shelter can also be termed valid for filing of matrimonial cases pertaining to cruelty due to dowry demands.

The Supreme Court verdict came on a plea filed by a woman called Rupali Devi who hailed from Uttar Pradesh. The SC said that a woman driven out of her matrimonial home because of cruelty can initiate criminal proceedings under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the place of her shelter or place of her parents' house where she resides
