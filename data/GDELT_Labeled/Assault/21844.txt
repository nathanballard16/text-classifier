No payout can heal Unnao survivor’s wounds: Court

NEW DELHI: No amount of compensation can bring justice to or heal the wounds of the survivor, the court that convicted expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar said on Tuesday.The CBI, meanwhile, sought the maximum punishment of life imprisonment for Sengar a day after he was convicted of raping a minor girl from Unnao in 2017.District and sessions judge Dharmesh Sharma made the observation when the question of victim compensation arose. CBI counsel Ashok Bhartendu submitted the court shouldn’t be sympathetic while deciding on heinous crimes and when they relate to the sexual assault of women. “Inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system,” he said.While Sengar’s counsels, Tanveer Ahmed Mir and Dhruv Gupta, offered to place documents relating to their client’s financial status, the survivor’s counsels, Dharmendra Kumar Mishra and Poonam Kaushik, sought to address the court on the quantum of punishment.“Certain clarifications are required from the defence with regard to the financial status of the convict and also about witness protection measures for the victim of the crime and her family members,” the court said. As a result, time till December 20 was given to the respective parties.Sengar was convicted under IPC Section 376 (rape) and Sections 5(c) (whoever being a public servant commits penetrative sexual assault on a child) and 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Pocso Act In the court’s view, the investigation suffered from a “patriarchal approach”, one that tended to brush under the carpet the issue of sexual violence against children, and lacked sensitivity and a humane approach.The survivor’s testimony, on the other hand, was found to be “unblemished, truthful” and of “sterling quality”, and the same prompted the court to conclude that she was “sexually assaulted by Sengar” at Makhi village.Even if it was assumed, the court had said, that the survivor had been having an affair with one of the men accused in the gang rape case, that “by itself is no ground to assume that she had any motive to falsely implicate Sengar”. The court had also criticised the CBI for not conducting the probe in a sensitive manner. “It appears somewhere that the investigation in the case has not been fair qua victim of the crime and her family members. The investigation has not been conducted by a woman officer...,” the court said.
