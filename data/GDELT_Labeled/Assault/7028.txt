Asaram's son convicted in a rape case by Gujarat court

Narayan Sai, son of jailed self-styled god man Asaram, was convicted by a Gujarat court in a rape case on Friday.

The sessions court, which convicted Narayan Sai will declare the sentence on April 30, in Surat.

Two Surat-based sisters went up to the police claiming they were raped by Asaram Bapu and his son Narayan Sai, in 2013.

In between 2002 and 2005, when one of them was living at his ashram, she had accused Narayan Sai of repeatedly raping her back then.

Asaram is serving a life term as he had been convicted in a rape case in Jodhpur.
