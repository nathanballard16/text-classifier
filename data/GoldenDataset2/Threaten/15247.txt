Pakistan lodges protest with India

F.P. Report

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with India over its recent ceasefire violations along the line of control which resulted in the martyrdom of three innocent civilians

Director General South Asia and SAARC Dr. Mohammad Faisal, summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia today and condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by the Indian occupation forces in Shahkot and Khuiratta Sectors.

Dr Muhammad Faisal urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 Ceasefire arrangement in letter and spirit and maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary. He urged that the Indian side should permit UNMOGIP to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions.

Dr Muhammad Faisal said the deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas is indeed deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws. The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.

The Indian occupation forces along the LoC and Working boundary have continuously been targeting civilian populated areas with artillery fire, heavy-caliber mortars, and automatic weapons, which still continues. This unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1970 ceasefire violations.
