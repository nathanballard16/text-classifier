Organized by Tahreek Muslim Shabban, the meeting called for a boycott of the CAA and a rejection of the Pan-India NRC implementation. The President of the organization, Mr. Mushtaq Malik, candidly stated, “The government has mala fide intentions to crush the religious freedom of Muslims. To educated people about the NRC and elaborate why Muslims will boycott along with the CAA nationwide, public meetings and peaceful protests are in the works by the above-mentioned organizations under the Tehreek Muslim Shabban banner.
