Imran Khan warns about war as Narendra Modi and Donald Trump turn ‘buddies’

United Nations: Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan bluntly warned that war is possible over India’s crackdown in Kashmir, while US President Donald Trump ‘buddied’ up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their second meeting in three days.

Donald Trump urged the sides to resolve their differences even as he gushed over Narendra Modi and said that the latter was as popular as American rock legend Elvis Presley.

The nuclear-armed rivals have been locked in a worsening standoff since August 5, when the Indian government revoked the special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

“For 50 days, the people of Kashmir have been locked down by 9,00,000 soldiers,” Imran Khan said, describing mass arrests, non-functioning hospitals and ‘a total news blackout’.

“Eight million people in an open jail is unprecedented in this day and age. … The biggest worry is what happens once the curfew is lifted? There’s a potential that two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face at some stage,” warned imran Khan.

While Khan warned of war, Trump was having a much lighter moment with Modi. Asked to describe his chemistry with Modi, the US President Trump said it’s ‘as good as it can get’.

“I have great respect, I have great admiration and I really like him, that’s another thing,” Trump told reporters. He went on to describe Modi as a ‘great gentleman’ and ‘great leader’ and suggested he be called the ‘father of India’.

Narendra Modi also showered Trump with praise, saying he’s ‘definitely my friend, but he is also a friend of India’.
