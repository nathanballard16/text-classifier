Bomb Threat Forces Newark Bound Flight To Land In London

An Air India flight bound for Newark International Airport was diverted to Stanstead Airport in London after officials received a bomb threat.

According to an article published in the New York Daily News, flight 191 took off from Mumbai, India early this morning on its way to Newark, New Jersey. Shortly after the flight left Mumbai, a call was placed saying the Boeing 777 was fitted with an explosive device.

A Royal Air Force spokesperson released a statement that said, as soon as the threat was placed against the aircraft Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled at supersonic speed and quickly intercepted the plane and accompanied it to Stansted Airport.

Air India officials told CNN that the flight was diverted for "precautionary," reasons and the plane was thoroughly searched on the runway before it was allowed to taxi to a gate.

Stansted Airport tweeted that they were sorry for any disruption caused by the incident and the airport is now fully operational.
