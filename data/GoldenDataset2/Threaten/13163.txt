SP legislator questions Sec 144 imposed in Rampur ahead of Akhilesh Yadav visit

Samajwadi Party MLA for Rampur, Abdullah Azam Khan, on Friday hit out at the ogi government ahead of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s visit to his constituency. The SP MLA questioned the imposition of section 144 in Rampur since past several months.

Are the people here not Indians? Don’t they deserve to live in peace? Do the people in Rampur not want peace? Who are we! Why have they (administration) imposed section 144 for the last several months? So why have they created a tense situation in Rampur? Abdullah Azam Khan said exclusively to India Today TV.

The legislator warned the administration that there could be untoward incident if the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is barred from visiting Rampur on Saturday.

Akhilesh Yadav is a party chief, he is our leader and he is coming home. Media and everyone will see how he is being stopped from coming home. If there is any untoward situation then we will face it, he said.

This will be Samajwadi party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s second visit to Rampur after the first one was stalled due to law and order issues. Akhilesh was not allowed to meet Rampur MP Azam Khan.

The administration had cited a law and order situation during Ganesh Chaturthi and Muharram for the imposition of restrictions. DM Rampur Anjanay Kumar also said that section 144 will remain in place till October 2.

The administration has deployed a thick police blanket to avoid any incident during Akhilesh's visit. Five police companies, four rapid action force teams and 300 sub-inspectors, 200 new recruits as well as 15 magistrates have been deployed to ensure peace in the region on Saturday.
