Thick security blanket thrown across Karnataka

In the wake of Supreme Court verdict in the sensitive Ayodhya land dispute case, a thick security blanket has been thrown across Karnataka.

The government announced holiday for the schools and colleges in the state on Saturday.

"The situation is good everywhere. Elaborate arrangements have been made. In sensitive areas, extra precautions have been taken," Karnataka Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, Amar Kumar Pandey told PTI.

Seventy platoons of Karnataka State Reserved police were deployed, besides stationing two paramilitary companies in Bengaluru and Mangaluru.

He explained that Bengaluru security arrangements would be assisted by the Central Reserved Police Force while the Rapid Action Force would be deployed in Mangaluru.

"Depending on the situation, the Central Paramilitary can be deployed in any part of the state.

All our policemen, leaving the skeletal staff to manage the police station, have been deployed," Pandey said.

He added that pickets, patrolling and striking force are in position.

The top police brass warned miscreants of stringent action against those who challenge the law and order inthe state.
