Traders to boycott Chinese goods over its support to JeM terrorist Azar

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has decided to boycott those cheap Chinese goods that swamp Indian markets after that country thwarted international moves to got Pakistani terrorist Mazod Aszhar for a fourth time, to bail out its close ally, Pakistan.

China, Pakistan’s most reliable friend, has repeatedly thwarted efforts to implement UN sanctions against Masood Azhar, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the group that claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 40 paramilitary police in Kashmir.

In fact, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents 70 million traders, said it would burn Chinese goods on March 19 to “teach a lesson” to China.

“The time has come when China should suffer due to its proximity with Pakistan,” CAIT said in a statement. “The CAIT has launched a national campaign to boycott Chinese goods to boycott, calling the traders not to sell or buy Chinese goods.”

The United States, Britain and France asked the Security Council’s Islamic State and al Qaeda sanctions committee to subject the Jaish leader to an arms embargo, travel ban and asset freeze.

But China placed a “technical hold” on the proposal, saying it needed more time to consider, using the same stalling tactic it has used in the past.

China is India’s second biggest trading partner. Chinese products, supplying anything from mobile phones to cheap toys, and leaving India with a nearly $90 billion trade deficit in the year ending March 2018.

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, also called for a boycott of Chinese goods.
