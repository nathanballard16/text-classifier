Air pollution from hazardous particulate matter climbed back to alarming levels in the Delhi area on Tuesday morning after an overnight dip, data from the Central Pollution Control Board show.

At daybreak, the capital and adjoining regions -- Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad -- were engulfed by a dense noxious smog that reduced visibility.

According to SAFAR, the air quality in Delhi at 8.48 am Tuesday was "severe"; the government has cautioned against all outdoor activity.

Levels of PM 2.5, particularly dangerous particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter, were in the "severe" range in many places -- including the IGI airport and Lodhi Road -- and are projected to get worse tomorrow.

On Monday, air quality in the Delhi-NCR area bordered "severe" levels with more farm fire plume blowing towards the region, and a decrease in the wind speed and temperature hampering the dispersion of pollutants.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court-mandated anti-pollution authority EPCA has said dirty fuel-based industries in Delhi and its suburbs will remain shut till the morning of Wednesday, November 13.

The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has also extended the ban on hot-mix plants and stone-crushers in Delhi-NCR till Wednesday morning.
