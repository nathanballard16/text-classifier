Murder charges framed against 2 cops for allegedly killing Apple executive in Lucknow

A court here on Saturday framed murder charges against two UP cops Prashant Chaudhary and Sandeep in connection with the killing of an Apple Executive Vivek Tiwari last year.

The court of Additional District Judge (ADJ) Sanjay Shankar Pandey after framing murder charges against the accused persons fixed April 4 as the date for the recording of statements.

Both the accused were sent to jail after the charges were framed against them. The police had in its charge-sheet booked Prashant on murder charges while Sandeep was only booked for assault.

Following this, Kalpana Tiwari, wife of the deceased Apple Executive approached the court to frame a murder charge against Sandeep. After hearing Kalpana's plea, the court on March 8 directed Sandeep to surrender before it.

Sandeep was present at the scene of the crime along with the main accused, constable Prashant.

On September 28, 2018, Tiwari was allegedly shot dead by a patrolling constable for refusing to stop his car. On October 2, the post-mortem examination report of Tiwari revealed that he died due to a gunshot injury on the left side of his chin.

During the preliminary investigation, the cop who allegedly shot Apple executive claimed that he fired at the latter's car in self-defence as he tried to run over his motorbike. The bullet was allegedly fired by Constable Prashant, while he was accompanied by Sandeep.
