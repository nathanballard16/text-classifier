Two Kashmiri vendors beaten up by Hindu mob in Lucknow

LUCKNOW –Indian extremists mob assaulted, slapped and thrashed two Kashmiris vendors in Lucknow on Wednesday just because of their identity.

According to Indian media reports, the Kashmiri men were selling dry fruits on the busy road side of the city when a charged mob abused the Kashmiris and beat them with sticks, after which some locals stepped in and rescued them.

A video of the incident, which took place in Daliganj area, has gone viral on social media sites. The Kashmiri men can be seen covering their heads and pleading to the attackers to stop beating them.

The attackers asked one of the Kashmiri vendors for his identity card as he tried to pack up and leave the spot.

The video also revealed a local man asking the mob to stop the assault on the men and not to take the law in their hands.

The Indian media has claimed that the Lucknow police has arrested the attackers.

In a bid to shut down the freedom movement, the Kashmiris faced torture and assaults by Hindu extremists after the deadly Pulwama attacks, killing more than 40 Indian Paramilitary troops.

After the Pulwama attacks, Kashmiri students and businessmen were assaulted across India and were forced to leave the state just for their identity.

Following the incident, former chief minister of the occupied Kashmir Omar Abdullah took to the Twitter and wrote:

“Nothing will do more damage to the idea of India in J&K than videos like these. Keep thrashing Kashmiris like this on the streets at the hands of RSS/Bajrang Dal goons & then try to sell the idea of “atoot ang”, it simply wont fly.”
