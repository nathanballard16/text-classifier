Pulwama Terror Attack: Nakuul Mehta condemns the dastardly act, says, 'prayers for the bereaved families'

Around 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district were killed and many others were injured on Thursday in one of the worst terrorist attacks. According to reports, terrorists used an IED bomb to blow up the security personnel vehicles which were moving near the Awantipora area of the district. According to reports, around 350 kg of explosives were used to carry out the bombing.

The injured personnel have been moved to the army hospital in Srinagar. Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-E-Mohammed has claimed responsibility for the dastardly attack. While the Government of India has called out for a strict action against the dastardly attack, Nakuul Mehta of Ishqbaaz fame has joined the nation for offering prayers for the bereaved family as we condemn the attack.

According to NDTV, Home Ministry sources have informed that the bomb was triggered while 78 vehicles with over 2,500 CRPF men were on the Srinagar-Jammu highway. The Ministry claims that the stretch on which the incident took place had been sanitized in the morning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the citizens that a befitting reply will be given to those behind the attack and has asked the United Nations to declare JeM as a terrorist organisation.
