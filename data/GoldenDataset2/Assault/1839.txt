The couple was taken to a farmhouse where the woman was gangraped.

A couple was abducted, looted and beaten up by some men who later gangraped the woman on Saturday night in Ludhiana.

The abductors took the couple to a farmhouse where they took turns to rape the woman.

According to the complaint, the couple was travelling in a car around 8 pm when a group of five men pelted stones on the car and stopped them.

The couple was dragged out of the car and taken to a farmhouse nearby.

The man was beaten up and asked to bring Rs 2 lakh. He called his friend and asked him to bring money. But he went to a police station and informed the cops. The cops, however, did not act upon the complaint.

The accused who were initially five in number called seven others and all of them raped the woman as the police failed to reach the spot.

The accused are still at large. Mullanpur Dakha police have registered a case against the unidentified accused. They are also trying to scan the CCTV footage to identify the accused.

The couple has also demanded action against the cops on duty.
