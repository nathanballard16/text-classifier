Lucknow: In a shocking case that has come to light from the state of Uttar Pradesh, a madrasa teacher was arrested on Saturday by Hapur police for allegedly raping and impregnating a 13-year-old girl. The accused has been identified as one Sajid, aged 26.

In his complaint to the police, the minor girl's father claimed that she joined the madrasa about a year ago. However, family members noticed a change in her health in the past few days prompting them to question her. When asked, the girl told them that Sajid had been sexually assaulting her over the past four months at his uncle's residence. She further added that the accused threatened her with dire consequences if she were to expose his heinous crime.

The girl's father also told police that the accused even threatened him when he was confronted. Sajid has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for sexually harassing and assaulting the minor girl.

Following an official complaint in this regard, Hapur police arrested Sajid on Saturday and produced him before a court which sent him to prison. Additional superintendent of police (ASP), Hapur, Ram Mohan Singh told media outlets that the victim has been sent for a medical examination but the process is yet to be completed. Meanwhile, the Minority Welfare Officer of Hapur said that it is still unclear as to whether the madrasa is affiliated to the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education or not.
