Hyderabad: Hunt on to nab 70-year-old who tried to rape a baby

The accused identified as Mohammed Jabbar of Moghalpura was working at a hotel at Sultan Shahi.

Hyderabad: The Moghalpura police is looking for a 70-year-old man who attempted to rape a two-and-a-half-year-old girl child at the under-construction area of the hotel on Wednesday.

The accused identified as Mohammed Jabbar of Moghalpura was working at a hotel at Sultan Shahi. On Wednesday evening, he saw the toddler, whose family stays in the neighbourhood of the hotel playing near the hotel.

Jabbar took the girl to the first floor of the hotel, which is under construction and allegedly tried to sexually assault her. The girl’s parents noticed that the child was missing and alerted the locals who went searching for the girl.

They found Jabbar in a very objectionable position with the girl. Moghalpura inspector A. Ravi Kumar said “The accused was seen attempting to sexually abuse the girl child. On seeing the locals and the girl’s parents, he managed to escape from there.”

The police has registered a case against Jabbar under the POCSO Act, and a search is on to nab the septuagenarian.

The girl was sent for medical examination and later handed over to her parents, Mr Kumar said.

Balala Hakkula Sangham, a child rights organisation from the city, demanded that the police take immediate action against the accused and ensure speedy investigation and trial in the case.
