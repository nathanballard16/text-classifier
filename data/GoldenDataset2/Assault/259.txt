RAJKOT: An old enmity between one-time friends turned gory when two assailants stabbed a man to death in Shivajinagar locality of Rajkot on Friday night.The residents of Shivajinagar found the body of Bhupat Bolia (25) lying on the street in a pool of blood and informed police on Saturday.According to police, while searching for Bolia’s friends who had met him last, they found Bolia’s cousin Sagar Boria (22), a resident of Chunaravad and Bolia’s friend Kana Mundhawa, who had witnessed his murder.Police investigation found that an old enmity between Bolia and Aslam Pathan was the result of the crime and that he had been stabbed to death by Pathan and his associate Sikandar Juneja.In their statements to the police, Boria and Mundhawa said that while they and Bolia were warming themselves by a bonfire in Chunaravad locality on Friday night, Juneja came on his bike. He told Bolia that he knew about his fight with Pathan and could broker peace between them. After this, he asked Bolia to accompany him on his bike. However, Boria and Mundhawa asked him to leave his bike and go on a two-wheeler of their friend.“As Boria and Mundhawa mistrusted Juneja, they decided to follow him. At about 1 o’clock in the night, they saw Pathan stabbing Bolia while Juneja held him from behind. When Bolia managed to wriggle himself out of Juneja’s grip, both Pathan and Juneja ran after him. This time, Pathan grabbed him from behind and Juneja stabbed him,” said an official from Thorala police station.When Boria and Mundhawa tried to intervene, both Pathan and Juneja threatened to kill them, brandishing knives, and asked them to go away. Scared of them, Boria and Mundhawa did not inform police and went to sleep.Police said both Bolia and Pathan were friends once. However, a discord over some issue created a rift in their friendship and they turned foes. Police are yet to arrest Pathan and Juneja.
