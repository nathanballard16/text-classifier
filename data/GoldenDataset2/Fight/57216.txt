Jharkhand assembly election: Issues confronting BJP

Jal, jungle, zameen

Non-tribal CM

Alliance partners

Infighting within BJP

NEW DELHI: As the BJP seeks to retain power in Jharkhand , it encounters some major problems in achieving its target.The opposition parties, particularly, Congress and JMM, have launched a powerful attack on the BJP over issues related to the tribal population, such as Land Acquisition Bill , amendments to the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act (SPTA), Chotanagpur Tenancy Act (CTA) and Raghubar Das as a non-tribal chief minister.The reason for raising these issues is that people belonging to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category constitute 26 per cent of the state’s population.Moreover, of the 81 assembly constituencies in Jharkhand, 28 (over 34 per cent of the total number of seats) are reserved for STs.The Land Acquisition Bill, amendments to the SPTA, and CTA comprise the main components of the opposition attack on the Raghubar Das government in the state.Congress president Rahul Gandhi, speaking in his election rally in Simdega on December 2, accused the Das government of snatching away land from the tribal population without their consent and not giving them desirable compensation for it.Gandhi said there was abundant water, forest cover and land in Jharkhand but wealth was not with the people. He promised that if the Congress came to power, it would implement the law it has formulated in Chhattisgarh.“The Congress government in Chhattisgarh has promulgated the Forest Rights Bill which stops snatching away of land from the tribal people,” he said.When Raghubar Das was sworn in as the Jharkhand chief minister in December 2014, he became the first non-tribal person to occupy the chair ever since the state was carved out of Bihar in November 2000. All predecessors of Das - Babulal Marandi, Arjun Munda, Shibu Soren , Madhu Koda and Hemant Soren - belonged to the ST category.Das, who was an employee of the Tata Steel, belongs to the OBC category. The Congress and JMM, headed by Shibu Soren who belongs to the ST category, has made non-tribal CM an important issue in the ongoing assembly election.The opposition hopes to do a Maharashtra and Haryana in Jharkhand. In the 2014 assembly elections in these three states, the BJP experimented with the CM’s post.As Maharashtra politics is dominated by the Marathas, the CM has traditionally been a Maratha. Similarly in Haryana, where the Jats dominate politics, the chief minister generally was from this community.However, going against the traditional local politics, BJP appointed Devendra Fadnavis, a Brahmin, as the Maharashtra CM. In Haryana, it appointed a Punjabi, ML Khattar, as the CM.Though the BJP and the Shiv Sena won majority in Maharashtra as pre-poll alliance partners in the October assembly election, the latter parted ways over power sharing. It formed a post-poll alliance with Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress. Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray succeeded Fadnavis as the CM.In Haryana, the BJP failed to win majority though it emerged as the single largest party. Khattar retained his chair with the help of Jat-led Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala.In Jharkhand, Congress and JMM have raked up the issue of Das as a non-tribal CM in the hope of garnering the votes of the tribal people.In the 2014 Jharkhand assembly election, the BJP emerged as the single largest party by winning 37 of the 81 seats. It formed government by forging an alliance with the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) which won five seats.Led by Sudesh Mahto, AJSU has its base among the Kurmis in Chhotanagpur region. BJP and AJSU have broken the alliance and have contested the election separately.Not just AJSU but BJP-led NDA’s alliance partners JD(U) and LJP are also contesting on their own.Another headache which inflicts the ruling BJP is its internal squabbles. Foremost among them is the contest in Jamshedpur (East) seat which went to polls in the second phase on December 7.Das is pitted against his former cabinet colleague Saryu Roy, who held the food, public distribution and consumer affairs portfolios for the past five years.However, he quit the cabinet after being denied a ticket from his Jamshedpur (West) constituency due to his alleged proximity to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U). Roy is contesting against Das as an independent candidate and is backed by both JD(U) and JMM.Though the BJP leadership is solidly backing Das as the party’s face in the ongoing election, a faction of leaders is unhappy with the decision. This section wanted a tribal leader to lead the party in the election.This faction may rear its head in case the BJP fails to win a majority on December 23, when counting of votes takes place.
