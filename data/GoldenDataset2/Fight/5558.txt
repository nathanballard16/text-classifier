Jaipur, February 12

Rajasthan Government will take a decision on the ongoing Gurjars' agitation of rail-road blockade on their 5 per cent quota in the assembly on Wednesday, a minister said on Tuesday.

As Gurjar agitation for reservation entered its fifth day, Congress’s Khetri MLA Jitendra Singh said: "The government will take a solution to end the stalemate on Gurjars' agitation which entered 5th day and created unrest in the state".

The legislator was speaking after a meeting that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot chaired at the Secretariat.

He indicated that the Gehlot government will also hold a cabinet meeting at 5 pm on Tuesday.

Late on Monday night, Gehlot called a high power committee to review law and order situation in the state and discuss Gurjars' demand. Chief Secretary D B Gupta, DGP Kapil Garg, DGP-Law & Order M L Lather, and a CMO's IAS officers attended the meeting.

Meanwhile, over 44 trains have been diverted, six cancelled, and seven others partially cancelled on the Delhi-Mumbai via Kota and Sawaimadhopur railway stations since the protests began on Saturday.

Jaipur-Agra National Highway 89 at Sikandra has also affected. The Sawaimadhopur-Dholpur highway has been closed for public.

Since Monday bus operations have been suspended in Alwar, Bharatpur, Mathura and the sections of Hindon-Karauli highway.

Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti activists also held road blockades at Bundi district’s Nainwa, and Asind in Bhilwara district, and NH 58 near Ajmer on Tuesday.

Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti’s KS Bainsla and thousands of his supporters are holding indefinite sit-in for over one km stretch between Malrana and Meemod railway stations in Sawaimadhour district.

So far no violence has been reported in the state, a police official claimed.
