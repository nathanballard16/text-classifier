Karachi Police: Indian Intelligence Agency Helped Plan Chinese Consulate Attack

The chief noted that the terrorists had "transported weapons in a boat engine from Quetta to Karachi through train service," and that the equipment was stored at a safe house in the western part of the city.

Shaikh said the group trained and prepared for the attack for nearly four months. "They used to sit in the visa section of the consulate to observe when the gates open and other details," he told reporters, noting they also had computerized fake identity cards.

The day after the attack, Muhammad Amir Rana, Director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) in Islamabad, told Sputnik that "It may not have a major negative impact on bilateral relations between China and Pakistan… But, of course, it will increase the security costs of all these initiatives."

"This particular attack reflects the anger of this insurgent group about the Chinese presence in the province," Rana told Sputnik. "Rightly or wrongly, they conceive that this economic transformation initiative may not help the Balochi people but is going to be a benefit for the major ethnic group of Pakistan."
