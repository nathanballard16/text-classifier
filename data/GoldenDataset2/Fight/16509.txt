Woman kills tenant for causing nuisance on Holi

Ludhiana: A 37-year-old woman allegedly killed her drunk tenant, hoping to stop him from causing nuisance for neighbours on Holi.

Tibba police arrested Manjeet Kaur of Kartar Nagar for the crime on Friday.

The deceased, Harpeet Singh, 26, a pick-up van driver, was celebrating Holi with his wife Jyoti, 30, and other tenants in his house, police said.

Inspector Paramjit Singh, SHO Tibba police station, said Harpreet along with other tenants were having drinks in the house while playing loud music, prompting a neighbour to lodge a complaint with Manjeet Kaur.

When Manjeet asked Harpreet and other tenants to stop music or lower the volume, it led to a spat. Meanwhile, Harpreet’s mother, who had come to his house, took him to her house near Gurmail Park to end the fight.

“A few minutes later, Harpreet returned to his house, telling his mother that he will come with his wife Jyoti, who is alone at home. But on reaching his house, Harpreet and Manjeet were again involved in an argument, following which the latter hit Harpreet with a rod.”

“Thereafter, Harpreet’s wife took him to his mother’s house where Harpreet’s condition started deteriorating. He was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead,” the inspector added.

Assistant commissioner of police (east) Devinder Chaudhary said Harpreet did not sustained any visible injury on his head, therefore the police waited for the autopsy report. Post-mortem revealed that head injury caused his death.

On the basis of the autopsy report and statement of Jyoti, the police registered a case against Manjeet under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.
