Asaduddin Owaisi is going to contest Lok Sabha elections from Hyderabad. He told that his fight is with those forces which are continuously eliminating brotherhood and secularism in the country. If someone says that there are two national parties in the country, then I will say no. There is only one national party BJP, another 1.5 is BJP. There is no difference between the BJP and the Congress. It is reported that 40 CRPF jawans were killed in the terror attack on February 14 in Pulwama, Jammu, and Kashmir. In this attack, the suicide bomber of Jaish-e-Mohammed collided with the army forces in his vehicle by filling more than 100 kg of RDX.
