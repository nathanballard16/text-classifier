Communal violence erupted over a financial dispute between two persons at Undel village of Anand district on Sunday

Vadodara/Anand: Two persons were killed and five injured in a communal clash that broke out at Undel village of Anand district’s Khambhat taluka on Sunday.

The clash between members of two different communities started in the afternoon after heated arguments between two individuals over a financial dispute.

Glasses of a four-wheeler also got damaged in heavy stone pelting during the violence that broke out near the government hospital close to Undel bus stand.

Sources said the groups attacked each other with sharp-edged weapons and pipes, which left seven people injured of whom two succumbed at a local hospital.

“There was some financial dispute between two individuals and this had led to scuffle,” said Khambhat’s deputy superintendent of police Reema Munshi, while confirming the deaths of two middle-aged men at the local hospital during treatment.

“The injured are being treated at the hospital. The situation is under control but we have beefed up security in the village,” she said.

“We have deputed a SRP company to keep a strict vigil. The police bandobust has been beefed up to ensure that the final rites of the deceased get over without any trouble,” she said.

Sources said the two who passed away during treatment were Jasubha Chavda and Mohsin Malek. Meanwhile, Sagar Chavda, who received severe injuries on his chest, has been shifted to Vadodara’s SSG Hospital for further treatment. Pritesh Patel and Tejas Patel, two of other injured, had suffered only minor injuries, police sources said. Police were in the process of registering a complaint against the rioters.
