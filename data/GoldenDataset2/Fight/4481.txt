Fox News published an exclusive by Dana Winter about a new “disturbing” trend of gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers routinely assaulting Border Patrol and other law enforcement.

From Fox:

“EXCLUSIVE: A game warden hit in the head with a rock while trying to seize a raft. Police officers wounded in an hours-long standoff with a gang member wanted for murder. Criminals spewing obscenities and death threats at local cops before asking for – and receiving – medical treatment.”

A Border Operations Sector Assessment report compiled by the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Border Security Operations Center recently released details about incidents of rocks being thrown at agents, agents being shot at, gang members brazenly approaching people in their homes, and men dressed in camouflage carrying long guns and automatic weapons, Winter reported.

Assaults on law enforcement are increasing.

From July 16-23 alone, 6,028 illegal immigrants were apprehended, 4,152 of whom were not from Mexico. Most came from Central America. But there also were people from Russia, Morocco, China, Cuba and India, among other nations.

Some of those crossing are wearing black uniforms.

The Border Patrol are being shot at and it happens every night according to the report. One agent said, “We are sitting ducks, and it’s only getting worse. Every night, it gets worse.”
