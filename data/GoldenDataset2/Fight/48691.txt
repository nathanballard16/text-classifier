Vadodara: Three months ago when his father was arrested allegedly for killing his mother, the future of Bhavesh Devipujak seemed bleak. He had no relative to look after him. Today, the eight-year-old boy is now living a normal life, attending school and playing games with his friends in the evening. Thanks to the city police that stepped up and gave support to the boy.

“We have admitted him to Bal Gokulam – a children’s home that is run by the government. Bhavesh is very happy there as he has got new friends. We are relieved to see him live a normal life,” said ACP S G Patil (E division). “He does miss his father occasionally. We have taken him to meet his father who is lodged in Vadodara central jail,” Patil told TOI.

Patil meets Bhavesh occasionally and he even wanted to take the boy home for Diwali celebrations. “But the workload during the festive season won’t allow me to do that,” he added. Bhavesh’s father Bharat was arrested in August after police investigations revealed that he had killed his wife Kanku in a fit of anger after a fight in January last year.

When Patil learnt that Bhavesh had no one to look after him, he took the boy to the E division police building in Panigate area. A special room with a bed and fan was allotted to Bhavesh who was always accompanied by a lady cop. The police made all the efforts to ensure that Bhavesh doesn’t miss his family. He was given toys, good food and clothes to wear by the friendly cops who even dropped him daily to school.

“When people learnt about Bhavesh, many came forward and donated lot of clothes and toys. Some even wanted to adopt him. We would have kept him in our police building as the cops were ready to look after him. But we decided to keep Bhavesh in Bal Gokulam so that he can grow up with the kids of his age and live a normal life,” Patil said.
