BHAIRAHAWA, Nov 8: People on Friday have taken to the street at Belahiya along the Nepal-India border to raise their voice against the encroachment of Kalapani by the southern neighbor.

The sister wing of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) All Nepal National Free Students’ Union (ANNFSU) under the leadership of Laxmi KC protested against the inclusion of the Kalapani area in the Indian political map.

During the protest, the demonstrators chanted slogans against the Indian move carrying placards reading ‘Back Off India’, ‘Down with Indian Expansionism’, ‘Scrap Unequal Treaty’ and ‘Return Encroached Land’.

Local people also joined students who warned of stern protest if the map is not corrected at the earliest.

Addressing the protest, NCP leader Arjun Giri stressed the need for having a cordial relationship between two countries by respecting each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Student leader Laxmi KC vowed to sacrifice for the sake of border security.

Other speakers stressed the need for unity among Nepalis to raise a strong voice against Indian border encroachment.
