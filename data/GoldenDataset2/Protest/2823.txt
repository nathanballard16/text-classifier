Lawyers to hold protest march on Tuesday

New Delhi, Feb 11 : City lawyers will take part in a protest march from Patiala House Court to Jantar Mantar on Tuesday demanding budgetary allocations for the welfare of advocates, a statement said on Monday.

According to the Bar Council of India, 1.7 million lawyers across the country are showing solidarity to the protest march.

"The legal fraternity is urging the Union government to provide budgetary allocations at all-India level to ensure that the welfare scheme for lawyers as stated above is implemented uniformly at the national level," said K.C. Mittal, Chairman, Bar Council of Delhi.

He said the peaceful protest march will start from Patiala House Court at 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday and proceed to Jantar Mantar.

The office bearers of the Bar Council of India, Bar Council of Delhi, Supreme Court Bar Association and Delhi High Court Bar Association, among others, will participate in the protest march.

According to the Bar Council of Delhi, "The said protest is being undertaken to press for various demands, as the Union government has done nothing for the legal fraternity despite the fact that advocates are the pillars of the democratic fabric of the country."

The demands raised by the lawyers include providing medical facility, insurance, housing schemes, financial assistance to young lawyers, pension schemes, not scrapping the Bar Council of India and State Bar Council like the Medical Council of India, to amend the Legal Service Authority Act to enable the lawyers to discharge the functions under the Act and to amend all the acts for the appointment of retired judges as presiding officers in various tribunals and commissions.
