Shillong: A day after the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was passed in the Rajya Sabha, violence flared up in north-eastern states. After pandemonium in Assam, where three people succumbed to bullet injuries in Guwahati amid protests, violence spread to neighbouring Meghalaya. Mobile services were suspended for 48 hours and messaging.

Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma whose party National People’s Party (NPP) voted in favour of CAB, left Shillong for New Delhi to urge Amit Shah that people of his state are protected from the bill.

Tyres were burnt in the middle of Motphran market in Shillong and stones were pelted at the police.

The developments come as the Meghalaya Chapter of the North East Indigenous People's Forum (NEIPF) demanded that the state government pass a resolution to immediately implement the Inner Line Permit (ILP) in the entire state.

The CAB which seeks to provide citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh excludes areas in northeast protected by the Inner Line Permit and Sixth Schedule provisions from its purview.

An indefinite curfew was imposed in Assam’s capital Guwahati other than Dibrugarh, Tezpur and Dhekiajuli towns.

Internet was also suspended in 10 districts of the state for 48 hours starting 12 noon Thursday, to prevent "misuse" of the social media to disturb peace and tranquillity, and to maintain law and order.

PM Narendra Modi today accused the Congress of trying to fuel tensions in the Northeast, saying that the politics of the grand old party and its allies depends on illegal immigrants. The PM also assured the people of the state that no one can take away their rights, unique identity and beautiful culture.
