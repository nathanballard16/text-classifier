Cops beat up protesting farmers in Rajkot

Farmers from Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani’s home district Rajkot on Monday staged rigorous protest against the government over the issue of non payment of crop insurance claims. The police charged baton over the protesting farmers and detained them to stop the protest. The farmers also warned the government that they would stage even bigger and rigorous protest in days to come, if their demands were not accepted. More than one thousand farmers in Padadhari town had gathered near Mamlatdar(tehsildar) office of Padadhari taluka and had blocked the roads. The agitation was led by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, a sister organisation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) working for farmers.
