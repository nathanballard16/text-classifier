Congress smells blood, to escalate citizenship stir

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi will lead a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Guwahati, the ground zero of unrest, as Congress looks to escalate the confrontation with BJP with nationwide rallies against the contentious law on the party’s 134th Foundation Day on Saturday.On the other hand, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will a protest against CAA-NRC and “failure” of the government’s economic policies in Lucknow — lending a face to the party’s charge.In Assam, Rahul will also meet families of Sam Stafford and Dipanjal Das, two youths who died in police firing. With the Gandhis are leading the “Save India, Save Constitution” marches, Congress has at the last minute decided to make them a much bigger show than the initially planned “flag march” in state headquarters.Saturday’s rallies across states on CAA-NRC row will be the second leg of protests by the party after the marches this week led by Congress chief ministers in five states where it is in office.The launch of Congress protests suggests that the party sees a long-term potential in the unrest and would prefer to have its own place on the ground. Given that Congress led the charge against CAA and NRC in Parliament, the party is buoyed by the chord it has struck and does not want to lose its imprimatur on the issue.Speaking to reporters, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said, “Faced with a massive backlash, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are resorting to characteristic doublespeak and are now attempting to covertly undertake the exercise (NRC) through NPR.”
