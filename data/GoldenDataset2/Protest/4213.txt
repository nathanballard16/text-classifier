They raised their voices but only to be heard over the din, not by way of aggression."Amol Palekar, his wife Sandhya, Kabir Khan, Anuradha Parikh, Urmi Juvekar and Shireen Gandhy joined the procession. The choreographed parade included 1,000 performers with segments assembled by different artistes and directors.In the run up to the protest, the team members had been releasing anoymous posters on social media every evening, urging citizens to share it online.."None of us is free if one of us is chained," wrote one artist. Another said, "I am he. I am she. We are here today. We will be here tomorrow."Group 2020 is an offshoot of the Artists United movement of Delhi.
