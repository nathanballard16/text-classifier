CAA, NRC protests HIGHLIGHTS: ‘People will not allow PM Modi attack Constitution, suppress voice,’ says Rahul

“What our enemies could not do, is now being done by Narendra Modi to stall the country’s progress,” Gandhi said.

Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Protest Today HIGHLIGHTS: During the ‘Satyagraha for Unity’ at Delhi’s Rajghat — a memorial of Mahatma Gandhi — organised by top Congress leadership, led by party chief Sonia Gandhi, to protest against the amended Citizenship Act, former party chief Rahul Gandhi Monday evening accused PM Narendra Modi of spreading hate and trying to break the country. “The country will not let you attack the Constitution, suppress the voice of ‘Bharat Mata’,” he said.

Meanwhile, in Kerala’s Kozhikode, three migrant labourers hailing from Bengal were assaulted by some unidentified people for allegedly taking part in anti-CAA protests Sunday night, PTI quoted the police as saying. The Murshidabad natives were beaten up on Sunday night after they came back from a protest march organised at Nadapuram, the police said.

On the other hand, a Delhi court Monday dismissed the bail plea of the 15 people who were allegedly involved in Delhi’s Darya ganj violence extending their judicial custody by two weeks. Earlier, on Saturday, the court had sent the 15 detainees in two-day judicial custody. The Delhi Police explained that the 15 were arrested as they had pelted stones and a deputy commissioner of police was injured among others.

Meanwhile, fourteen of the 16 persons who were killed during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act over the last four days in UP succumbed to “firearm injuries”, senior police officers from eight districts confirmed to The Indian Express. For over a week, the country has witnessed widespread protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), especially in combination with the proposed all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).
