Bondli villagers to hold protest march today

Ludhiana: Villagers of Bondli and its neighbouring areas, who are forced to take a long road for travelling between their villages and the nearby towns, have decided to hold a protest on Chandigarh Road here on Monday.The villagers have demanded construction of an overbridge on the under-construction national highway bypass at Samrala. Also, Machhiwara will get far by a few kilometres.”“We have heard that they are providing entry and exit points near Chehlan village, another such point 3-km north of our village at Dayalpura. They have already threatened to boycott the upcoming Lok Sabha elections if their demand is not met.Set to lose the main road against the construction work, the villagers have put up boards highlighting that they will vote only for the candidate who promises to solve their problem. The other irony is that the bypass will divide our village, with many villagers having houses on one side of the under-construction road and farmland on the other side.” He added this was a major issue in many villages of the area, and they will decide on voting after proper response from the authorities. Many people in villages like Sihala, Toderpur, Jhar Sahib, Kakrala and Behlolpur have shown resistance to the construction of the road (without the bridge) that will bypass Samrala town and increase the distance for them to reach Samrala and Machhiwara.Jasmair Singh, husband of the Sarpanch of Bondli village, said since they will lose the main road to their village which will increase the travel time between their village and the neighbouring towns, they have decided to protest the ongoing construction.
