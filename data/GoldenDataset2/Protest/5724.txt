Airports Authority of India officer sits on fast unto death

MUMBAI: An Airports Authority of India ( AAI ) assistant general manager is on a fast unto death since past Thursday, seated outside civil aviation Delhi headquarters in Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan. Sunday is the fourth day of his fast.Yogendra Gautam is the general secretary of the union that represents AAI officers and his protest is against the management's decision to recruit engineers with no experience in aviation-related fields to the post of managers.In November 2018, 1700 electronic and electrical engineers appeared for exams held across India by AAI to fill the post of 324 managers (E3 level). Out of this 1268 have been called for interviews, said sources.The AAI officers who maintain the radars and ground equipments used by air traffic control centres in India have been protesting against AAI for having lowered the eligibility criteria for these posts. In a March 14 letter to AAI management, Gautam alleged that AAI has been "pushing through undeserving candidates for appointments" wherein they will hold a senior position despite not being as, experienced in aviation field, as the junior executives.An AAI official said, "Aviation is a specialised sector, so having these engineers with no relevant experience in the field as managers would be detrimental to safety." Earlier, five-years of experience in aviation was one of the eligibility criteria to become a CNS manager. Also, AAI had a more stringent eligibility criteria for entry level junior executives (E1 level). "How can a government organisation put up a demanding eligibility criteria when recruiting to lower positions and then get lesser qualified engineers for higher posts," the official said.
