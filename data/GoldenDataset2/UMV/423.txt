Assam BJP slams Asaduddin Owaisi for NRC remarks

GUWAHATI: Assam BJP minority cell chief Mominul Awal lashed out at All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi for his statement that the "so-called myth of illegal citizens was busted" after the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was published in Assam.Awal is also the chief convenor of the Janagosthiya Samanvay Parishad - an umbrella body of 21 indigenous Muslim organizations in the state. Addressing a press conference on Monday, he said people like Owaisi, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee are giving a religious colour to the process for political gains. "He (Owaisi) has no idea about social life in Assam and by his statements, he has negated the six-year-long anti-foreigners movement in the state. Owaisi just wants to create religious tension but he won't succeed," Awal said.Taking a dig at Imran Khan, Awal said he had no locus standi on the issue as NRC is an internal matter. "In his country, Muslims are being killed inside mosques. When it comes to India, Muslims are feeling much safer since Narendra Modi has came to power," he said. Referring to the citizenship register, the Pakistan prime minister on Saturday said the Modi government's "ethnic cleansing of Muslims should send alarm bells ringing across the world".After the publication of the final list, Awal had said that the people of Assam will never accept this erroneous NRC. "Those who should have figured in the NRC remain excluded, but, those whose inclusion was not desired have been able to get in," he had said. He had added the indigenous Muslims belonging to the Goria, Moria, Deshi and Zula communities who were excluded should not worry as the BJP would make sure that their names are incorporated.
