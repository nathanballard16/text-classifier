Schorzman begins new role at NY Times

Douglas Schorzman will return to the New York Times bureau in New York next year after a successful run as deputy Asia editor based in Hong Kong.

Schorzman will serve as a deputy international editor upon arrival.

In his new role, Schorzman will work with Kim Fararo to help drive the daily report and stay ahead of the most important storylines playing out globally.

During his time in Asia, he ran coverage across a wide area, including India and all of Southeast Asia. He has covered topics including ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, the war in Afghanistan, the rise of Hindu nationalism in India and the crash of Lion Air.

Adrienne Carter, the Asia editor, says, “He is a fierce advocate for reporters with an incredible depth of knowledge and a keen sense of storytelling.”

Schorzman will start in his new role in February.
